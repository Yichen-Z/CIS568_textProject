Conversion Nightmare,"As a former bank B employee of 10+ years, I was very happy. When this bank bought out bank B I was hesitant but excited for something new. This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed. The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform their jobs efficiently. I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off. The job roles we were placed into did not align with prior roles and responsibilities. The stress level is unreal. Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress. Imagine starting a new job as a banker. You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and procedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat. Not one person knows these new systems and it's time to open the doors on a Monday. You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to. That want to service accounts but you don't know how. That truly need you to help them but you can't. That is what this process is like.

Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and management treat you like a customer. When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time. You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete paperwork and notes on customer accounts with the customer on the line. You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do. Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet Co-workers from other departments's own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another.

Good Remote Job and Traditional Blend,"This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met. Lots of autonomy with getting job done!

Initial training was good and exciting but branch ruined it,I believe a company should be graded on how they treat customers and employees.

I was as a new employee only 4 weeks in this branch told off and humiliated in front of a customer because I didn't know how to do it ( I was told I got it when I didn't. when I tried to object I was than told u got it like it's easy A second time. During this process I tried to ask my branch manager for help (you know so I can do it right) but she was chatting with a friend instead of offering assistance. Turns out I didn't Open an account correctly and literally got told off infront of the customer and humiliated.) I had enough of the lack of training and that awful experience made me contact HR but With me being within the 90 day period I felt I didn't matter because it took over a week for a response. I ended up calling her out and the branch manager came in and tried to blame it on me not trying to listen to there 'teachings'. They would threaten me about 90 days coming up and me having to take it seriously. Keep in mind I literally had to stand in the lobby half of my day. I was setup for failure and humilated and harassed ( they would tell me I can't touch my beard and talk about how I would sit when making calls).

A review I wish I would have read prior,"I was hired at a PT customer core consultant. The first 7 weeks of training are very redundant and long. A lot of self paced modules and 'role playing'. One of the systems used does not have a training bank, so when you're placed one your first call day in training its a bit confusing because it's only been explained to you, not hands on. We have 2 trainers, one whom was great the other, not so great. The time off is a complete nightmare for anyone who has kids. You have to be there a year before you receive any PTO and if you have to take time off before then you receive an 'occurrence'. Being a previous manager at bank, I do understand the need and responsibility of being at work and being on time, but I also understand that life happens. If you get to many of these occurrences you'll be terminated. After your 7 weeks of training you go into transition for 5 weeks for is a full 6 hours on the phones with ONE 15 minute break. I was told I needed a note from my doctor if I had to get up and use the bathroom an 'excessive' amount of times. If I hadn't of had previous banking experience, this job would have been difficult for me to learn as they do not explain the in's and out's of banking very well. You have a Team Lead during your 12 weeks, then after you are sent to your destination, you will have another Team Lead. The pay is OK.

Be careful what you wish for,"I was recruited away from another company after over 6 years there, was promised the things that my former company could not provide for my career to grow. From the first month there I realized this bank was not very different from my previous company in regards to management. They have managers that go by advice from senior employees, some of them should not be in any position to give management advice. I was told I was ready to go to my new location, then 3 days later told I was not. Then I found out from other employees that the person who was training me was not happy I was to be replacing them. They lied and falsified information, including sending fake emails about my position! This kept me from fulfilling the position I was hired for. I found out after I left the next person to replace my position also was treated unfairly and quit due to this same situation, by the same employee! I would definitely make sure you have asked and gotten every question answered before accepting a position there. Although I left my previous company in good standing I could not go back, as my position had been filled.

Terrible for working parents or anyone else really,"There are some things that are positive, like the maternity leave. You can literally take off 4 months to have a baby. The problem is after you have that baby, any time you may need is dependent on your manager/department. There are not set rules or policies as far as how to take OA time, leaving early,vacation days, etc. So, if you have to leave an hour early to take that new baby to the doctor, you better dam well have OA time or you are S.O.L. And don't even think about having a disabled child, because when those last minute things pop up, as they absolutely will, you either need to take OT time or FMLA that you won't get paid for. Even if your department has over time on a weekly basis, there is no making up unless it's 'scheduled'. Unless that is your are one of the special employees whose rules don't pertain to you; then you're ok. Also, they won't train you for you're position and if you make a mistake, they then want to write you up and threaten your job. You can ask just about any employee at this bank and they will tell you the training is deplorable. Throughout the entire company. Plus, don't think you'll be able to move around based on the merit of your work, work ethic, performance because it's all about who you know. If you don't know someone in a department, you more than likely won't even get a shot, especially if it's a supervisor position. They have to interview people for legal reasons, but what you don't know is they already have someone in mind for that position, so they are just wasting your time.

Regional Leadership/ Work Culture," this bank has the potential to be a great place work. However, in the past 2 years there's been an extreme lack of leadership resulting in a very high level of turnover. I mastered many skills, and enjoyed the opportunity to grow client relationships, but the focus changed in to a more micro managed, sales oriented environment, where the branch manager's had little lead way to make judgment decisions in the best interest of the team, or clients. The Region's Leaders don't care about the branch employee's. There were many days they would enter the branch, and not speak to the staff. That in itself makes one feel unappreciated, and devalued. A main reason for the increase, and loss of many valued, tenor employees due to the ability to break down the regions morale. The benefits are okay along with the chance to earn incentive bonus. Communication which is one of the company's core values was almost nonexistent. Sometime new hires aren't given a fair chance at proper training, and advancement depends on who you are, Overall this bank is a good company when led by consistent, strong, management.

Customer Service," this bank is a great bank as a customer. They offer all the things retail banking customers are looking for. As an employee, they were great to work for except for compensation. We once had a meeting where the Regional VP was talking about different levels of accounts. He said 'who doesn't have at least $2,000 direct deposits per month in their checking account' (helps avoid monthly fees) and everyone in the training meeting raised their hand was like 'I don't even come close to $2,000/month in direct deposits'. Showed how out of touch management was from their customer facing employees. I believe this bank recently increased their minimum wage, but when I was there, it was below $10/hr. They offer tons of incentives for referrals, but you were lucky to get one or two per day due to the emergence of online banking and most people making the switch from traditional means. Overall great company. Just don't work here if you are the only source of income in your family (more of a supplemental income position or for mom's re-entering the workforce).",Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Jarrettsville, MD","August 28, 2018",3.0,"Customer Service.  this bank is a great bank as a customer.
