If you work in a shopping center like I do, you are a teller and a telemarketing salesperson. In spite of the heavy teller traffic, you are judged strictly on sales goals and telemarketing numbers. The calling pressure is so great it tempts people to fudge numbers and report successes that are not really there which of course allows management to justify continuing high-volume calls. 50 per cent of the job is telemarketing, 40 per cent teller work and 10 per cent opening new accounts.If you do not mind working until 730 at night (starting at 1030am) and don't have an issue making 150 cold calls a month this job might be right for you. If not, stay away!!!","If not, stay away!!!","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9806185364723206}",220

The best way that I can describe my experience with this bank (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly.The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that they become exempt). Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in.The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year. If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition.The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input. Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems. Mistakes are made often because many people have no idea what they're doing (through no fault of their own).",Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems.,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994124174118042}",115

281,Loan Closing Analyst,Former Employee,"Pittsburgh, PA",09/10/2021,2.0,"Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised. Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality. The faster you work, the more praise you get. In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct. If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on. Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for it not to be able to be finalized. This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since it was pushed back to accommodate other rush files. Those that fly through their files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par.

After being released, I was given a specific amount of time to find another internal position - at the ONSET of Covid spreading all over the country. There were no internal jobs posted for my experience level or office position, so I was let go after the number of days allotted for me to obtain a new job. I once loved working there, was proud of my employer and worked my butt off on many nights & weekends to meet deadlines, I had fantastic bosses (except the last one) and was very disappointed at not being able to continue my employment. Other than that, good company.","Other than that, good company.","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998447895050049}",278

This is not a good place to work. this bank Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to them. If a manager feels threatened, they will do everything they can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group. They claim they provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen. The amount the company raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year. So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases.

672,Teller Supervisor,Former Employee,"Pittsburgh, PA",09/03/2020,1.0,"Former Pgh Employee. ● Work-life balanceMy branch had absolutely no work life balance. It was basically like you back to high school in terms of the employees being extremely over-dramatic, refusing to do their jobs, and there was never follow up from management unless it was to punish. Even then, it felt like they didn't want to handle out of control employees. Because of that, I was constantly on call, coming in on my days off and staying late but getting in trouble for the amount of overtime I inevitably accrued.● Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with this bank are grossly under compensated for their role. We were expected to act as managers with barely an increase in salary from a basic full- or part-time teller.● Job security and advancement this bank always has opportunities for advancement but they will absolutely play favorites on who they allow to progress.● ManagementManagement, from branch to upper management, only care about meeting their sales goals.

The pro's to the job is the pay rate (pays really good for a entry level). The job is pretty stressful as well; you have to know how to deal with the constant yelling from customers and the constant changes within the company that you aren't notified of on time enough to explain to customers. You can't advance the way you would like to; you have to work a whole year to get your hours changed and their isn't any pay increase unless you change positions. Management is so so; sometimes they help but most of the time they aren't much help at all. Plus breaks are based off how busy the center is that day; sometimes you were on the phones for 3-4hours before your short break of 15mins. I liked the pay but otherwise it was just to many other problems that continued to happen. It was hard to follow the policy 100% correctly because it was so many constant changes going on plus you didn't have enough chances to correct anything before they'll write you up.
