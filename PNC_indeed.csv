"Great place to work for most","I have really enjoyed working here, the only issue is in career advancement.  There are some traditional routes that work for some, but anything outside the norm is extremely difficult no matter what level of performance or  participation you have.","Branch Sales and Service Associate II","Current Employee","Ann Arbor, MI","March 27, 2019","4.0"
"It's a job","You go in five days a week do what you need to then leave, the employees are jerks, and the manager does nothing to keep them from being one. If the employees were more respectful it would be a decent place to work.","Cook","Current Employee","San Antonio, TX","June 2, 2022","3.0"
"Stressful","Banking as a whole has become an awful industry to work in. Large corporations still using old school tactics to bring in sales. Corporate yuppies don't understand that pounding pavement to attract sales is not an effective sales method. Furthermore, the manager is tied up in meetings all day that get in the way of managing, which leaves little time to get anything done. ","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Florida","June 1, 2022","2.0"
"Micromanaged and very little room for growth","I worked for PNC for about 10 years and every stop was a non existent budget for raises, positions that continue to expand with compensation to match. Find a better company if growth and development are your thing.","Executive Client Relations","Former Employee","OH","June 1, 2022","3.0"
"Stressful environment ","Core service consultant. This place is essentially a phone factory where management offers little assistance and expects associates to take back to back phone calls all day.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","June 1, 2022","1.0"
"Productive ","It is a good place to work with management who cares to see you succeed. Some banks micro manage but this one doesn't. PNC bank also really cares about your benefits ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Dallas, TX","May 30, 2022","5.0"
"Every year they cut your pay","Every year they expect you to work 20% harder for 20% less. There is no future of growth for you as an MLO. Management makes poor decisions, but you as the employee shoulder the burden for it. They don't hire the staff when the market is hot, and they then overcompensate by hiring too much, and don't see the market changing. Currently, their idea of fixing the market downturn is for you to call dead end phone numbers of existing customers in their data base. Then the Master Plan is to automate MLOs out of their jobs as much as possible to assure future cuts in MLO pay.","Sr Mortgage Loan Originator","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","May 29, 2022","2.0"
"I learned a lot on the job It was a good experience."," Working the evening shift was a plus for me at the time I worked in their corporate office working on various bank documents. This helped me learn more about how the banking business worked, more about how checks and other items were recorded and verified.  I learned how the bank process is handled. I had no problem with My manager or supervisor. The workplace was culture. The job was easy nothing was hard about the Job. Working as a team player and keeping busy.

"I have a lot to say about this company but it's pointless …","poor management and your work like balance is never going to be 'a balance ' but I'm just one person but PNC isn't all bad /amazing benefit are good .","Teller Representative","Current Employee","Port Saint Lucie, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
"Worst place to work","No work life balance. Outdated systems. Extreme Micromanaging. They watch you by cameras and then open investigations based on assumptions. You don't have control over your branch and no ability to waive fees for good clients! If you need to step out of the branch and have worked over 40 hours they still make you use your occasional absence! The Regional Manager could not even understand that goes against Florida Law! PNC wants you to just be a micromanaging robot! Clients are just another person and they say they are about relationship building but their actions do not show it! I received a job offer for 20k more with a much better Financial Institution that truly values their employees and clients! ","Sr Branch Manager","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
"It'll do, but it kind of sucks","When I started at PNC I was really excited and energized. I had heard a lot about the opportunities PNC offers. That part is true, they have a lot of different departments you can train in and growth opportunities. The downside is you do have to stay an entire year in your current position before you can apply for a different one. So if you hate the area you're working in you better be able to suck it up for 12 months. They do their best to have life/work balance and are big on employees quality of life. However, if you work in a physical branch, you will not be trained. I moved from the care center to the branch and was put in an office for 4 months to train myself. I made countless mistakes every single day due to lack of resources and training. They use outdated software that is extremely hard to navigate and crashes constantly. I got fired for something small, it was my fault, but a writeup may have been a good first step as I had never had a red mark. The people I worked with were great but you could tell how much they hated their jobs. The end of my career with PNC I was extremely burned out and stressed. If you want to be overworked and work 6 days a week twice a month, PNC would be for you. ","Banker","Former Employee","Paw Paw, MI","May 26, 2022","2.0"
"Productive, inclusive but lacks work life balance","Everyone does their share here although some managers believe in micromanaging. You only have to stay in each position for a year and you can move around and apply for a new position as much as you would like. My only 2 complaints are with the pay; while they increased the base pay for all positions, positions like tellers supervisors and people who are both bankers and tellers have sales requirements but receive no sales pay. Also the hours are getting worse it makes work life balance hard for those who have small children. Maternity, 401k, stock options, and tuition reimbursement along with other benefits are great.","Lead Teller","Current Employee","Delaware","May 26, 2022","3.0"
"It was okay. ","Okay place to work at. Seems like all they cared about was sales. It paid the bills. Work life balance was okay. Not a job I was completely thrilled about. ","Service Representative","Former Employee","Gloucester City, NJ","May 26, 2022","3.0"
"Don't work here","I have been with the company for 6 months and been without a manager for 5 months. I have to learn the banks systems by myself with no help from upper management. Don't waste your time with this company. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Asheville, NC","May 26, 2022","1.0"
"Micromanage and demeaning ","Worked here for 3 months as a Sales Rep because that's all I could take. Managers micromanage you. You can't even go to the bathroom. If you do, they'll ask where you were for so long (3-10 mins). I remember during training, someone asked are we allowed to take a break to go to the bathroom. One supervisor said do it on your scheduled break time. Taking calls back to back with people screaming at you and they don't let you take a break to decompress from it. This place is horrible for your mental, physical and emotional health","Sales Associate","Former Employee","Remote","May 25, 2022","1.0"

"They 'customer service' their own employees","The pay is nice however the stress is almost not worth it.  Half the time you don't even know who your manager is.  They are getting so big that they can't properly service their employees and you just get pushed around.  I've heard that they will escalate issues too many times and nothing is ever done.  ","Customer Care Center Rep","Current Employee","Frankenmuth, MI","May 23, 2022","1.0"
"You are just an underpaid Robot","They expect the world, with repetitive, duplicate documentation using sub standard computer systems that are always crashing. No work/life balance unless you are Management. They feel that they can command your life 24/7. Schedules set, but that is all fake since once you plan on the schedule set for you, they change it at a moment's notice despite anything you may have planned. If you refuse to 'fill in', they lump you as a non-team player. Management commits you to work areas and times they have not asked you ahead of time. Lunches are always interrupted, so if you want to have the time you are allowed, you have to actually leave the premises and turn off your phone.","Service Associate","Former Employee","Maryland","May 23, 2022","1.0"
"Company seems great, but my branch wasn't. ","I had high hopes with pnc. Poor management within my branch contributed to a terrible work environment. Too much gossip about new people. Managers lie because they don't know the answer. ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","North Carolina","May 22, 2022","2.0"
"Stressful place to work . Over worked and undervalued ","You are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated at all.  Managment is terribly and there is always miscommunication between managers. Such a stressful job. ","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Doylestown, PA","May 22, 2022","2.0"
"Pay is good ","It a ok company to work for but they are not organized I wish it stayed BBVA because once it become PNC they changed a lot but the pay is better I will say that's the only thing that's better than BBVA ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Birmingham, AL","May 22, 2022","3.0"
"No Comment ","Typical Banking profit over people mentality.  Better you do the more overwhelmed other areas are and then leads to great worker morale. On top of that the better one does the more incentive one makes but less they have to dole out for next quarterly making it harder to make said goals.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 21, 2022","2.0"
"The bank of the past","Pnc tries so hard to be a bank of the future but has terrible systems in place filled with service issues. Multiple locations have gone cashless yet atm always have service issues, new system still has a lot of bugs to work out and staffing is always a problem due to a high turnover rate. They expect you to drive sales but do not properly train you or give you proper product knowledge. The variety in products/ services is not competitive enough with the market and customer service department is even long wait times for the internal lines. The check in process for clients is completely awful and most customers complain about it yet it is enforced tremendously.Management gets to do whatever they want and regional manager doesn't really care about what's actually going on in the branches. This is a great place to work if you like to be swamped with clients and have a bunch of meaningless tasks to complete you barely have time to do.","Universal Banker","Former Employee","Virginia Beach, VA","May 19, 2022","2.0"
"Got me through Covid, But still not satisfactory ","I'm grateful to PNC Bank for getting me and my family through covid, and the benefits ( HSA, PARENTAL LEAVE, VACATION ) are nice, but ultimately due to some poor changes in incentives, branch hours, staffing and pay, i wouldn't call PNC a great company to work for. ","Branch Banker and Sales Associate","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 18, 2022","2.0"
"Good Start to banking career, burned out quickly ","Great place to learn and start your bank career. Lots of support from team members if you needed it. Downside was politics and playing favorites which I feel is most bank culture at the branch level. Really depends on management and there willingness to mentor you  ","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Georgia","May 18, 2022","3.0"
"Branch Manager ","1) Overworked, expected to work 6 days a week, work life balance is a joke in retail banking. 2) Sales quota doesn't reflect branch location and traffic. PNC approval criteria for lending services is extremely rigid, that doesn't work in a low to meditate income area. In addition managers have to drive small business in addition to other duties. 3) operations is outdated! Complete waste of productivity.

"Great company, poor senior managers","PNC Bank (mortgage) is an all right company to work for. I love that they promote working remotely, and so far all of my direct managers have been great! However, my senior managers have not been. They only care about reports and numbers, and not the actual employee. If you're blessed to work here & have a great frontline a manger then you'll be fine. Oh yea, getting hired on is like you're working for the FBI. The hiring process is strenuous and doesn't even align with the job and environment of the company.","Loan Processor","Current Employee","Remo","May 16, 2022","3.0"

"Good place to work ","If you can self manage while working from home, you can be very successful. However, if you can't, then you will fail rather quickly.

"Great place to work if you are hard working","I have been at PNC for only 2 months but I can confidently tell you it's a great place to work. They actively look to promote from within, as well as they are incredibly supportive. It is FAST PACED LEARNING so be prepared for that. If you get overwhelmed, tell your mentors, they are incredible and want you to succeed. I happen to work very late hours and I didn't feel that was significantly expressed to me when I accepted the job, but the pay and benefits outweigh the unfortunate working hours.

"Micromanaging, no work life balance","Branch manager role. Micromanagement to the core. Report after report of things you aren't doing correctly. Audits are conducted through the cameras. Absolutely no cell phone tolerance. Branch managers are business bankers- cold calls to prospect businesses and held accountable for achieving business goals alone (no bankers open business accounts) and held accountable for achieving consumer side as well. Incentive pay out only happens when 50% of your bankers achieve their goals, not if the branch is 100% or above or if you achieve the business goal that you are held personally accountable for. Understaffed and no applicants. Expected to conduct weekly meetings with every employee to touch base their goals - with no staff. Depending on branch size, bankers expected to call 800+ calls to consumers and branch managers expected to conduct consumer and business calls to be at target. Pnc is in the middle of switching programs to make it 'easier' - it's not. Expected to have 5 star customer service, write monthly action plans, and call surveys conducted on the branch for feedback and now additional calls to bad surveys to be invited back to be surveyed again. Phones must be answered on 3rd ring, even in front of clients at your station, expected to deliver offers to the client in the same interaction while delivering exceptional customer service, within a 'timely' (2 minute) manner. Corporate drives through your branches drive thru's and times their wait time while surprise visiting your branch.  Anyway, good benefits.

"Poor Retail Lending leadership has led to a mass exodus of top talent.  No signs of improvement.  ","Since the current leadership in the Retail Lending business has taken over the business environment has suffered greatly. The majority of the experienced product management talent have all left over the last year as a result of poor leadership and recent leadership decisions have made thing worse, especially in the card business.

"Do not take FA job at the branch","Bankers and tellers are forced to provide you with so call referrals. 99% are bad, so they can get management off their backs.

"Retail Lending business environment continues to suffer under current leadership team (Especially in Card) ","Over the past 3-4 years the work environment in PNC's retail lending world has suffered greatly due to it's ineffective leadership team.  As a result the work environment has become toxic, especially in card for both the product team and business partners.  Lack of leadership experience, poor strategic vision and the careless approach to managing employee relations and growth has lead to a mass exodus of much of the top talent.  As a result of an weak and inexperienced leadership team it is nearly impossible to accomplish the goals that are set and it has begun to negatively impact business in a major way.

"Great Culture","Good Company with great benefits. They offer competitive healthcare, and both 401K & Pension. However they are little conservative on the base pay scale, as competitors offer more. Because their base pay is low, their incentive program is really great, as top producers can earn a lot. The drawback to that is that you loose a lot of new employees to competitors because it usually take a while to get your self establish and start performing at a high level to get the big incentives.

"I used to love this job, but things have gotten tough.","I started at PNC a few years ago and moved up pretty quickly after snagging a few promotions. I used to love this job, but find it getting harder everyday to get up and do my best. I feel like since the merger in 2021, we've been on a very difficult path to recovery and not much is being done to help the front line staff answering customer questions and complaints. We went from being busy (1-2 minute call wait times) to exceptionally busy (customers are waiting 30 minutes to an hour before an agent is able to help). Since the turn of the year, this has not been getting better. PNC has tried to help some of these people by raising the minimum wage company-wide. While that did help some newer people, a lot of us got stuck with little to nothing in terms of a rate increase. While it MAY get back to normal in the next few months it has been pretty terrible from October 2021 to the current date. I am getting very demotivated and am seeking other opportunities outside the company.

"The PNC Board needs to reexamine the Leadership!","PNC has turned management into a team of babysitters that only recognize what the team is doing wrong. Never a 'good job' or 'great progress' and more importantly 'THANK YOU'.  Leaders address those who are not performing individually. I am sick of hearing how the team failed when I meet all of my goals! The majority of people are working long hours, training is practically non-existent or sporadic at best, we are told to reduce errors and take our time and the next day to pick up extra work and get it done faster (while constantly training due to turnover because we have no formal department training program). Can't you manage the company while retaining and keeping your employees semi-happy at their workplace? Also, it is sickening to read what the Executives receive in yearly stock options/bonuses,  your yearly salary is already more than my whole department combined! I understand the dynamics and responsibilities on your shoulders but you have turned extremely greedy while watching the staff figure out how they are going to feed their family/or pay for parking on their meager salary. I will obtain my degree in 2 months, I doubt my manager even remembers, and like some others, I am looking for a job that appreciates and rewards me for my work ethic and loyalty as well as my desire to assist others while independently striving to grow myself.

"Disorganized and not taking talent seriously","I've been at PNC for half a decade and have held more than one role at a mid-senior level. Each year I have seen more than 40% of teams turning over and spent a significant amount of work time recruiting for open roles. However once we get people hired, often we don't have work for them to do or they end up with busy work that isn't challenging. PNC isn't a culture where business results are prioritized enough, doing work tasks and having meetings is and the result is that they're falling behind in offering modern customer experiences. I am really disappointed in my experience, I expected to learn and grow and what I found is that management doesn't take the talent they have seriously.","Senior Strategy Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","March 12, 2022","2.0"
"Fast paced but monotonous ","My role as a teller is fast paced, the branch is very busy. Management feels out of touch with teller needs. The schedule changes daily and you're frequently stuck working beyond your scheduled shift time but even when you give advanced notice that you need a day off management makes you feel like it's a big deal and doesn't seem to want to work with you. Customers are super mean to new employees who are trying to follow policy for protecting customer accounts. The pay is higher than anywhere else in the area, and they do offer benefits, vacation time, sick time, etc. I would say PNC is a good company, there's plenty opportunities for growth, but I don't believe in my current branch that I have the tools I need to be successful and I don't want to stay long term.

"Conversion Nightmare","As a former BBVA employee of 10+ years, I was very happy. When PNC bought out BBVA I was hesitant but excited for something new. This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed. The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform their jobs efficiently. I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off. The job roles we were placed into did not allign with prior roles and responsibilities. The stress level is unreal. Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress. Imagine starting a new job as a banker. You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and proceedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat. Not one person knows these new systems and it's time to open the doors on a Monday. You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to. That want to service accounts but you don't know how. That truly need you to help them but you can't. That is what this process is like.  My advice, stay away until they figure out. 5 months in and there are still so many issues to resolve. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Georgetown, TX","March 8, 2022","1.0"

"Terrible Onboarding/Training experience ","Minimal training provided in a group virtual setting. The people in my group were hired for business banking and they definitely didn't seem qualified. Most didn't pay attention and were super disrespectful to the trainer. They couldn't grasp most of it and only 2 weeks of training they put you on the phone all but yourself before you even know how to use the systems and tell you to figure it out. Their 'in the moment support' requires you to wait long periods of time for someone to get to you which leaves the customer on hold forever and creates a terrible customer and agent experience. In the moment they have no time to explain what they tell you to do and you can't stop taking calls to ask. The calls are back to back with no break to document or look around. As soon as the client hangs another is in your ear. Craziest experience I've ever had. I've always been a top agent working virtually in customer service and NEVER seen anything like this.

Great, but when my performance review came, I was denied an increase since I had already reached the 75% percentile, and regardless of my job performance I was already earning the maximum allowed. Their salary was not competitive at all.They also ended up closing a lot of offices in the area within a few years of the acquisition.

"Trained for one job but ended up doing a different job","This company literally set me up for failure.  I was supposed be crossed trained on multiple jobs but was only allowed to be a teller, so I never was allowed to put the training in to use, therefore the rare times I was allowed to do my actual job, I had no hands on experience. The company puts great emphasis on selling products to get commissions, which caused an environment that was overly competitive and coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission would not let me train because they did not want me to get the commission and/or credit for the 'sale'.  The environment was hostile, especially at certain offices. (I was a floater)  I was there for 2 years and was very unhappy for the most part.  The teller training was great, but there was alot of overnight travel, usually for a week at a time, but the hotels were nice so if you like that kind of traveling it's nice.

The team leads and group leads are also a joke. They do not help when you need assistance with anything.

"Not For Me","The training was promising, the person who did the virtual training was nice, was a good start. Once I got into the branch it was constant stress for laughably low pay. All the managers knew how to do was micromanage and stress you out. Also a lot of conflicting statements such as 'answer the phone' and then at another point if you answered the phone you would get in trouble. Or 'don't be afraid to ask questions!' then you'd ask a question and you'd get the equivalent of 'Google it.' Then you'd get docked for not being quick enough despite being new and having a question and having to look up the answer yourself through a large 'PNC Edge' article which takes a considerable amount of time.

Senior management tends to be heavily skewed to one particular demographic and it becomes apparent any time there's a change broached, such as updating WFH policies (although the pandemic has changed some of that). Insurance options stink and you have to fight for every raise you get. Management would rather give one-time performance bonuses rather than a meaningful salary increase. It is embarrassing to work for a company that pulls in billions in profit every year and then I have to tell my staff they're getting a 1.2% raise.That being said, some managers (particularly the younger ones) are excellent and understand the value of providing employees the space to do their jobs without micromanaging.

PNC does not hold those values and I feel I must speak up.When I started working here I had never felt so confident about a company, but since COVID and the political tension of the past year or so, this company has really shown it's true colors and unfortunately it isn't a environment that is comfortable for all.

"You are expendable ","The best way that I can describe my experience with PNC (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly.The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that they become exempt). Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in.The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year. If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition.The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input. Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems. Mistakes are made often because many people have no idea what they're doing (through no fault of their own).","Loan Research Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 23, 2021","2.0"
"Imagine all of the bad/toxic managers you've ever had to work with all working in leadership positions at the same company","You are actively encouraged to saddle individuals with banking products they don't need and if you are not cut-throat enough to sell a drowning man even more debt your other talents will not be appreciated. Aside from that, HR is a complete mess and will not help you with actually bad things (I.e. harassment) and turnover is high because all the wrong people are promoted (but hey, at least they can open 12 different checking accounts for the same person, not everyone can pull blood from a stone). I did learn a lot in a short amount of time but that's really only because I'm self-motivated and a quick-learner; in my first year, my manager ran through literally 4 different new hires because: 1) they personally were very difficult to work for 2) had very high expectations and 3) wanted to put absolutely NO effort into helping to train the new people. I know there are a few good managers that work for this bank, but honestly do yourself a favor and go into this job either knowing you're in it only for the resume experience or that you're okay with being an over glorified ATM that's expected to try to sell a credit card to every person you talk to in a given day.

","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","September 11, 2021","5.0"
"Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised","Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality. The faster you work, the more praise you get. In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct. If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on. Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for it not to be able to be finalized. This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since it was pushed back to accommodate other rush files. Those that fly through their files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par. Pay is not competitive with other banks, even though PNC is the fifth largest bank, they still refuse to offer a decent pay, especially for the amount of stress the job causes. PNC prides themselves on inclusion and diversity but I did not feel or see that while working here. In my experience, trying to move around in the company is a hassle. I tried to get off the team I was on several times, applying for different positions and was always told they are on a hiring freeze. The only positive I can say is the remote work. Other than that be prepared to be stressed out, over worked and underpaid.","Loan Closing Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 10, 2021","2.0"

"Overall good workplace but mangement and scheduling improvements needed...","With PNC work life balance, it's important to understand each branch is different according to the manager. Some managers understand that work is work and there is some form of life outside of PNC so they'll stick to the 8 - 5 schedule; however, others do not. There is a lot of scheduling outside of typical 8-5 hours, for example rotating every other Friday until 6:15pm and then Saturdays quarterly. I can count on more hands than two the times I've had to stay late, come in early, or be sent to another branch over 25+ minutes away to help out at a moment's notice just in two months time. These requests disrupt the work-life balance because you basically cannot expect to get to any other commitment (daycare, appointment, etc) on time once you leave the office because you won't leave the office on time. Honestly, if we could get out the door according to schedule, the work-life balance would be great. When it comes to compensation/benefits, there's a lot of murkiness. You're asked to train two to four people and pick up slack in a short staffed branch because you've done such an outstanding job in your current role, but come annual review time your raise will not even be enough to make a noticeable difference. They will keep piling the additional responsibilities on to you but not compensate you for it. I believe my pay check's taxes for one pay period was more than my most recent raise for the whole entire year.  This seems a little confusing as usually commended performance is compensated fairly and a 'Meets or Exceeds Expectations' rating should be a valid defense for atleast - more...","Branch Banker","Current Employee","Huntsville, AL","September 8, 2021","2.0"

"Very sad I joined","I joined PNC out of compulsion.  Though they talk about vision and value.  It is all about PNC and their benefits. They don't care about their customers or their employees.  very shallow and self centered company.  at least that is what I faced working at Morrow Ga Facility. Nor company Nor their employees are friendly.  They mean business but how they work on it is amazing.  Team Sucks, Team Playing is 3 out 10.  They are ready to throw you under the bus any day anytime.  Privacy of customers or employee is not protected by any means.   Employees talking to customers or other employees about account or customer info in the lobby or in drive thru is open and loud in the branch.  other can hear and know lot of personal info about other clients and finances and funds or situation thru out the lobby.

"Not the Bank for career moves","Every morning, I'd wake up and dread coming to work when I was an RRT. You never know which branch you'd go to for the day. Sales goals were attainable, but it is a ""what have you done for me lately"" environment so things did not matter from yesterday. Not much in terms of PTO, lower side of 401(k) employer match, and even worse pay. Bonus structure was alright, but if you don't hit a specific threshold, then you could forget about any bonus. Immediate Branch Management was ok, they picked favorites, but would not really play favoritism. Upper Management is trash and would not care if you got hit by a car, just as long as you hit your goals to so they could pack their bank accounts. Covid made things worse branch employees, no raises, and if we had symptoms we were forced to use our own time to stay home, which is not really fair.

"Opportunities for advancement are great, Pay... not so much. ","PNC is an okay company to work for. If you are looking to learn the basics of banking, it is a good place to start. However, the upper management shows little regard for employees well-being. 401k match is 4 percent which is nice. 3 weeks vacation time and 5 sick day per year plus federal holidays off. That being said, the hourly wage at PNC is lower than most every other bank. Minimum wage here is $15.00 an hour VS the competitors starting at $18.00. The commission structure for the bankers is difficult to understand and does not pay out well even when exceeding goals. They took away commission opportunities for tellers which has negatively impacted the moral. Also, PNC likes to change their technology frequently which is stressful for the employees.

"workplace culture","I loved my Job in Recovery. But the bank decided that we needed to collect on any account in recovery. So they gave us old Home loans that were charged off for years. Pnc gave us one hour training to learn a new system to collect the payments on. The system wasn't communicating correctly with other systems. We were also dealing with lawyers calling in asking about these accounts.  So it was a big mess.  We were put on live calls fumbling our way through trying to please the customers and lawyers calling in. We were advised to take messages and someone would call them back with the information you are requesting or an answer to your question. No one called them back so we would get another call from the lawyer or customer fuming as no one has gotten back with them. Horrible stressful work environment.    After dealing with this mess I left the bank after working there for 13 years.  We got paid incentive for the dollars we collected on but if you were doing your job correctly and helping customers. You were on the bottom of collection $$ because you spent your day dealing with calls. It was pitting all employees against each other and not helpful to any PNC customer.

A few months later, 30% of my department's processes were automated, leaving a great deal less work to spread around.

Management is very contradicting when it come to your schedule and vacation time approval. No one is promise tomorrow yet the end of the year. Yet that want you to give them yo vacation time by end of January like year hasn't even started for time to see what's going on in spring, winter, and fall to enjoy. When you try to ask to rearrange things because of an event you may want to take time off for it's an issue.

It is extremely demotivating and addressing it with management is practically useless. You're basically told you need to get over it. My experience there wasn't a good one.

Upper management comes up with 'fixes' but has no idea what the day to day role is and continue to make the job increasingly more difficult.  Before I started someone that did not work for PNC said they heard it was a sweat shop and honestly that is a good description.  OT is mandatory and the only way to possibly meet management demands.  Good for the paycheck, but for quality of life.PNC also recently made the change that employees can roll over 3 vacation days.

"A life of busy work","A typical day at work: Log in. Join MS Teams. Engage in work/life related  banter all day. Each person handles their assigned tasks. Skype Meetings. Log out. Repeat the next day.What you learned: * I learned that Midwest culture in the work place is very NOT diverse. * When working remotely, the best way to feel like you are a part of the PNC family, is to go into a local branch and build relations with them. At least then you won't feel so apart.Management: Like anywhere, some are good, some are bad. Probably the worse part is the deluge of paperwork and processes that change weekly. Its like work for the sake of work. Whenever someone comes up with a procedure, they just make a new rule and even if that impacts some other process, so what.","Vice President","Current Employee","Washington, DC","June 26, 2021","4.0"
"Overworked and Underpaid","I strongly recommend not working on the retail end. The sales goals are unreal and unrealistic and the pay out is terrible. You have to do so much selling and only to get a few hundred dollars of pay out, which is only quarterly. Most of the branches close at 6, so that means you work 8:30am-6pm most days. They also don't pay you anything, no matter the experience you have. At most you will make $42K if you go into a branch as a banker and you have to fight tooth and nail for that. Turnover is extremely high. It's also hard to get days off, and don't even think about asking for a Friday or Monday off. It will be very hard to get, and they will give you the biggest guilt trip if you want either day off. Overall, unless you just really need a job, do not work at PNC on the retail side.

"They try to come off as 'different' but they are just like ever other bank","Working for Pnc is inconsistent , they treat some branches much better then others . For example the branches in more impoverished areas have far less technology and the branches aren't as upkept as the more wealthy areas. Working for pnc is like working for any other bank. It has its ups and downs . Your overall enjoyment while with the company Varys depending on the manager. One of the major drawbacks for working for this company is how they draw you in because of there status as one of the largest banks in the country but at the end of the day they pay like a small town credit union. Most employees with children have to work part time jobs to make ends meet because pnc  refuse to accommodate financially according to the times . Just like any other major financial institution you can go from being the top of the company in sales one month to literally getting fired the next. They are very strict on how they want things done , even if you have a different way that works for you they want it done 'there way'. Overall this company is a bunch of malarkey and filled with false promises . They are just like every other bank . Actually who am i kidding they are worse then other banks . Others banks close between 4:30-5pm Pnc decided to close at 6 pm but yet and still they post on the digital screens in branches about promoting a work to life balance .

Oftentimes, I found management to be disregarding, with a negative attitude regarding my experience and my advanced educational level (M.Ed.. + Ph.D. program ABD).at times, it seemed that jealously and a desire to be secretive regarding management's motives and actions was definitely part of the work culture. Openness of management is talked about, but not truely part of the work experience especially in recent years. The most enjoyable part of the job was the (limited) ability to interact with other employees that became my friends and supports.

"All depends on the branch","My branch was okay. My coworkers were amazing and my manager genuinely cared. It's all upper management. Corporate doesn't care about you.

Great job if you're okay with small yearly pay increases and small quarterly bonuses if you can sell.

"Straight forward job duties","Unreasonable checking account and loan goals. Every year diminishing compensation for all compensation (checking savings loans investments merchant services and advisor referrals both consumer and business).

"Smoke & Mirrors ","My experience may be a bit different because I started during a pandemic and was treated fairly but the circumstances set me up for failure in the long run. I didn't have the best management but my team was amazing. Once the branch fell below their little red line, you really started to see you were a number, a worker bee (nicely putting it). Management would become intentionally intimidating and even threatening, implying our jobs were at stake. The morale of my particular branch became so intense and toxic that myself and two others (out of 4 bankers) left. The hours at my location were 8-6 and Saturday's 9-2 and it made my work life balance almost unbearable. My time there was definitely rewarding as far as what I learned and will be able to build from but extremely difficult and hard to please upper management. They will run you ragged and expect the impossible all while putting on a smile wondering why you feel the way you do. This is a great position for someone starting out but I would do my time and go. PNC sells you sunshine and rainbows only to give you extreme stress and expectations that are almost impossible for even the most experienced banker to achieve. Pay was decent, hours are not good if you are looking for work life and family balance. My team of coworkers were the best but management definitely needs a ton of work.

"Poor management ","Poor management, years of service does not mean anything,  you are just a number.  Branch was not adequately staffed.

Other departments might be better, but I'm only referring to the AML Dept.. Goals are very difficult to achieve as the bar is set so high. Very little to no praise for doing good work.

Coming from a top performer in the Consumer Loans department for 4 years I can tell you, the ceilong is definitely not glass. Where they hire you is where they want to keep you.

"Decent","I was with the company for a long time. From the beginning to the end was a dramatic change. When I started there was a great work life balance and you only worked 5 days a week with regular Saturdays off. At the end you worked every day, but Sunday and getting a Saturday off it was very difficult. You also had to schedule all vacation and PTO in January. So if you needed a last minute doctor appointment, or family conflict later in the year, you had to request to move your days around. Which, might not be approved if someone else requested it off. There was very little room for advancement, even with a decent turn over. Upper management expects tip-top sales. You need to be at the utmost top of the list and you need to harass customers constantly for more sales. You're expected to make a product recommendation to every customer every time. This wouldn't be so bad, except the same customers come in all the time. Eventually, they get really frustrated and annoyed and stop coming in.  Then, you're expected to make sales calls and stay late to call customers and ask them to come in for appointments, even to the point of harassment. A system generated list appears and you must contact everyone on the list, even you just called them two weeks ago. ","Teller","Former Employee","Cambridge, OH","March 20, 2021","3.0"
"Decent Job","Its working a bank. lots of customer service, so if thats your thing, then this is the job for you. the other thing you may not be told or realize is PNC requires you to be a salesperson. They will play it off like they are helping customers, but they just reward people who churn out numbers. credit cards, loans. The idea is to get as many as possible. if you don't meet your goals because your clientele is declined repeatedly or can't afford loans and credit card debt, it isn't taken into consideration. Just the results are. It is a good company to work for. fantastic benefits. just very sales oriented and that isn't stressed during the hiring process.

"Not a lot of advancement","Although there are plenty of opportunities within the company it is harder for some positions to move up without starting all over with that positions base pay.

"inclusive work environment with supportive managment","PNC is all about work, life, balance. They value your work ethic and challenge you to do better everyday so you can advance and achieve your goals. They offer competitive pay rates and a great benefits package including 401k matching and generous PTO with paid holidays. With that being said, they do expect you to earn those benefits. There are sales goals to meet and that can be challenging with the other tasks you are expected to complete throughout the day (Such as answering the phone, balancing a drawer, holding appointments, & various office tasks). Ensuring the customer's financial wellbeing is sound is their main focus and some customers do not wish to listen when you offer the advice or product.

The CEO is great and they try to maintain an inclusive culture. Management in my department was great but I can't speak for other departments.

At the same time, coworkers were helpful and knowledgeable. Training team was nice and manager did all she could to help me progress. If you don't want to stay in retail or customer service, stay away. Time off worked on a seniority basis, didn't matter if you put it in months ahead. If someone who's worked at the location longer than you, they get to choose PTO before you. Have to work weekends. PNC was amazing with COVID pay on the other hand.

"Productive, Fun depends on your TL, Busy ","I do not feel the same about PNC. As I use to. 1. The biggest reason is *No Merit Increase* you want to work a person in three different departments, and No increase. You can do that to others, that may say *Well okay I will accept that* but others will not accept it. I have been through a couple of Acquisitions, with former companies, and my pay actually went up! Not stay the same! No, at PNC. This year there is no pay increase* seems it fell right in line with the Acquisition that just happened. 2. I was on a Team that had no morale. Some had no drive to want to have fun, the TL did not push fun, was dry, and really did not do much. Was behind the scenes hiding, only gave recognition to whom she knew the longest. Some Agents had terrible attitudes, but this could have came from the energy from the TL. 3. The OLD systems we work off of are horrible, too many steps to do anything, PNC took too long to get innovative with their systems *and you have ridiculous Merits to meet* QA is not consistent, some TL's you have to pull teeth to get them to dispute a SET score, some TL's do not acknowledge each Agent for good work. 4. I did not want to go by the career reviews for PNC. But they sure were true. It also seems like greed toke over, and after the acquisition *it was we have to think about PNC pockets.* 5.

"High Stress, Low Pay","There is not a good work-life balance at PNC. I am constantly working through lunch breaks and past my scheduled shift. The workload and responsibilities of this role are not compensated on a fair basis. You will be expected to take on an excessive amount of work with little to no training. I have constantly been lied to regarding raises, workload, and career progression throughout my time with PNC. Managers are scheduled in meetings all day and are not supportive. Upper management has no idea what is actually going on for front-line employees, yet they are the ones that dictate the processes and systems we use. There is also a large disconnect among different internal departments with no departments wanting to claim ownership for work and other issues. This ultimately will fall back on my role to take care because we have the most contact with the customers. This requires us to work on issues and research solutions that we don't have the tools for, all on top of our normal workload. You will find yourself working well outside of the job description with little to no extra incentives with PNC. Fully expect to be lied to regarding pay progression, career progression, and workload when working for PNC. If you absolutely need a job it's fine but don't work more than the bare minimum and don't plan on making a career here. ","Loan Support Analyst Senior","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 21, 2021","1.0"
"Good company to work for. Depending on what position you are in.","PNC as a company is good to work for. Be careful which position you chose. If your position involves sales be prepared for an overview of every move you make, Lots of cold calls (they don't consider it cold calling since they are clients but trust me they don't want the calls), and meetings everyday cutting into the time you need to make those calls. ","Banker","Current Employee","Ohio","February 21, 2021","3.0"
"Very Hostile Job Environment","This is not a good place to work.  PNC Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to them.  If a manager feels threatened, they will do everything they can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group.   They claim they provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen.  The amount the company raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year. So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases.  There are plenty more Financial Service Companies out there, I suggest you look somewhere else.","AML Risk specialist III","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 19, 2021","1.0"

"Back to back phone calls and crunched on time","While the pay and benefits are decent and there is paid time off, the job itself is quite stressful with panicked and stressed out customers calling in, often with complex banking issues. Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and they treat you like a customer. When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time. You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete it with the customer on the line. You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do. Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet their own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another. There are many positive aspects to this job including benefits and the way you can call in sick or schedule vacation is very independent, you don't need to tell your boss any personal details, just that you won't be in.You just call the call off line. The sent beautiful flowers to my brothers funeral when I had to call in to attend the funeral, which was incredibly caring. There are a lot of resources for a wide range of things, as long as you know where to look.

"Headed in right direction. But expect Ohio salary, regardless of where you live","I would recommend PNC because from management down to the line, you can tell the company cares about people.However, they are a bank. Nickeling and diming is what they do best. And salaries are no exception. Although I was able to negotiate a salary commensurate with where I live, I was never able to get a salary raise as the base salary for a big metro area like NYC or DC is far higher than the top earners in the Cleveland, Ohio/Pittsburgh PA market, where most of staff are based.The politics and diversity (lack there of) mimics the state of the nation. Expect nothing different there. The one thing I can say is that women are empowered at PNC and they are very much in leadership positions every where you look.Some areas adopt change and are forward thinking and adapt modern practices. Other areas or groups are stuck in mimicking older banks. There are enough of those pockets of teams that really slow down progress.","Vice President","Current Employee","Remote","February 14, 2021","4.0"

They expect you to make a sale with every customer that comes in and you are cold calling customers during your down time that want nothing to do with you. Training was awful as instructors never actually showed you how to do anything. We were also consistently understaffed during my time there so we always worked six days a week. You are consistently micromanaged by your manager and after every customer you are criticized for not making a sale and instead of coaching and training the manager would just tell me what I did wrong and would consistently talk bad behind employees backs.

The leadership truly believes in improving financial literacy  and demonstrates it through many philanthropic efforts across the US. During the pandemic, while every bank was reducing cost, PNC invested by creating an entire division within the commercial bank dedicated to organizational financial wellness. Base pay I would say is  very fair and bonuses have both a set and discretionary component. Very good health plan benefits with HSA, 401k and Pension.

Management expects employees to work almost every weekend and most nights.  Also, it is impossible to get any actual work done because meetings are scheduled throughout the entire day. So if you want to get any real work done, you have to work after hours.  Management does not trust their employees' knowledge and the management consistently does the opposite of what is recommended.

"Compensation and Culture are low.","Visit onsites and promote PNC Banks products. Open accounts onsite outside of branches. You must have a good team leader if you want to enjoy this role.

I went on medical leave and when I came back, my position was switched by my direct manager to a floater position where I had to drive 2 hours to get to any onsites. Spoke to HR and nothing could be done. The decision did not make success in my role conducive since most of my time was spent driving. My advice when working here: Don't get sick, don't seek surgery to get well or you may not have your position to come back to. Also, this is a dead end role even if you are a rockstar with your goals. Many of my team members have been in this role for years (as much as 13 years) and have not gotten promoted or considered.

"Productive, lots of room for advancement, stressful frontline roles","Just like most call centers, the frontline position can be pretty stressful with back to back calls which was the hardest part of my job along with the metric goals that were expected to be met every month while maintaining high scoring quality evaluations. Personally, the quality of my customer interactions took priorty over my own metrics, which became a topic of conversation during personal coaching meetings. However, my experience with PNC as a company, was very positive. The environment was always supportive, inclusive, and motivating. There were many resources available to all employees within the call center such as resume workshops, public speaking and leadership groups, and career corner opportunities (where you can learn more about other careers within the call center). PNC also had a comprehensive benefits package (including health/life/vision/dental insurance, 14 days of PTO given each calendar year, occasional VTO offered, up to 6 paid sick days, HSA, ISP 401k, FMLA, pension plan, home buying assistance, employee specific APRs on credit cards/loans, separate rooms within call center for nursing mothers, etc.).

High turnover rate, and extremely understaffed branches. Most of the time you have so much work, that you will leave something 'hanging', and most likely will be called out for it.

"Conservative company with poor management","Some successful people were terminated at PNC just because they reasonably complained about their branch manager's behavior. Instead of helping them, the higher management terminated them for a bogus reason. I worked with them personally and know what was going on. People can't speak out freely and are afraid of losing their jobs. I left because I realized that PNC is not the best place to develop as the bank encourages a hostile atmosphere in the branch. If you don't complain and meet their sales goals, you'd be most likely fine. Some branches, however, have great managers that value their employees, but those are rare. Other than that, if you work hard, you can earn good money there.","Service Associate II","Former Employee","Pennsylvania","November 25, 2020","2.0"

"Good company going downhill","PNC was great at first, customer service was the most important goal. Then, almost overnight, sales became the dominating concern. Initially I worked in a branch environment. The sales pressure over time became intolerable, so I decided to apply for and obtain a position in a less stressful environment.In my role as client Solution Specialist, it was a great, very professional atmosphere. Many good people. Unfortunately this is a position you cannot learn with a handful of books, training that consisted of 5 days sitting and watching another rep, and a ""buddy"" via Skype, who was mostly tied up with their own jobs to take time to assist. Asking for assistance was frowned upon, and nothing shy of perfection was treated as a disaster, where good performance was rarely addressed.PNC started as a great job, but the sales pressure in the retail side, and the borderline hostile atmosphere of the financial services group, it became a nightmare that worsened daily. 2015 PNC was a great company. Throughout 2016 it was mostly downhill. 2017 became absolutely intolerable from a stress standpoint to the degree I resigned before I even had alternative employment lined up.

"Branch Banker Associate","Do not listen to what they promise you. You will work 9-10 hour days in a glorified retail position. The company allows for customers to walk all over you, so long as they are happy. The only thing that they are concerned about is making a sale and trying to bring up numbers. They care very little for work-life balance and instead want you to be committed to a culture of selling and putting customers before your family. If it was not for my manager, I would have quit long ago. You will meet plenty of great co-workers, but it does not make up for the poor excuse of the rest of the job. The technology is 30 years behind and the systems you work with often crash or are not user friendly. In the position I worked, I had to do personal banking and teller work. You would think that would justify some kind of pay raise, but you will make marginally more than a teller and less than a banker. Essentially you are paid to do two jobs while receiving the pay of one job. The hours are long, and often I have worked 3-4 Saturdays a month. In terms of career advancement, it really depends on how they are feeling. They will tell you that after the first year of working here that you are able to move anywhere in the company. This is false doctrine, as they have denied me to 14 different jobs that I have applied for since my one year. Unless you produce an unholy amount of sales, they have no interest in moving you from retail. In conclusion, if you like sales and customer service you will enjoy this position.

"Decent company with good benefits but lacking compensation","I worked for PNC for five years and only during my last year did I have a manager that did their best to see about where I wanted to go in the company.. The company has great benefits with their 401k, health, dental, vision and employee stock purchasing. Working in retail banking gets very tiring.. After awhile you get tired of the clientele that comes in with overdrawn accounts every other day that can't manage their accounts. If you're good at multiple tasks don't be surprised to be taken advantaged of. I was the ATM custodian for years because another coworker was too slow. And I was expected to manage the teller line and also do banking on the platform side. Worked very hard day to day and deserved to be in a better position or at least be getting raises as I had always had a meets all yearly review.Also, the incentives you recieve quarterly were lacking and felt like a joke.

"Good pay and benefits ","PNC is a solid company with good benefits. Branches have set hours, and tellers don't need to stay indefinitely after work because the vault needs to be closed. Retail banking isn't for everyone. Some customers are just angry and irrational, particularly when they have caused their own problem. Unfortunately, they sometimes get the opportunity to answer a survey about you personally after they visit the branch. PNC. takes these surveys as gospel, and you can end up doing your job well, correctly, and kindly but being dinged in the survey by unreasonable customers. You have no defense. Something else that's hard is that PNC is very oriented to large cities, and their sales techniques and expectations don't play well in small towns where you have the same customers over and over. They don't want a credit card, as they told you last week and the week before, and some don't like that tellers are looking at their accounts closely, even to see what services or upgrades might really be helpful.

"Horrible Management & Unfair Treatment","Management is absolutely horrendous. The managers are two-faced.I felt like I am not treated equally based on position. The managers have favorites, there is always some sort of drama that they sit in office all day and gossip.The benefits are nice. The managers seem to think treating their employees like animals and brainwashing us into thinking this is normal treatment is OK.The managers fired the two employees that were open about their sexuality and I find that interesting - PNC boasts about their diversity, yet they fired them...our staff consists of only two POC (the rest is entirely white). The new employee that they hired got terminated within a week (she was also a POC, for reference).I learned to stick up for myself, not be taken advantage of (even though it almost got me fired multiple times).I went to the managers to file a complaint against another employee for inappropriate misconduct, yet they turned it into a lesson on how I was wrong for coming to them and it wasn't important enough to be filed on my behalf. I felt like I wasn't heard and I was bashed for bringing the situation to light.The branch manager breaks the dress code consistently. I wore a pair of heels (once) & they did not have a strap on the back. I got called into the office and was demanded to change my shoes. Wearing short dresses, sleeveless shirts/dresses, etc, the dress code doesn't apply to her. Abuse of power & position.The branch manager boldly told the staff, to our faces, with no hesitation, about her breast augmentation, because that is ethical and that is definitely - more...","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Cranberry Township, PA","September 5, 2020","1.0"

"Former Pgh Employee","● Work-life balanceMy branch had absolutely no work life balance. It was basically like you back to high school in terms of the employees being extremely overdramatic, refusing to do their jobs, and there was never follow up from management unless it was to punish. Even then, it felt like they didn't want to handle out of control employees. Because of that, I was constantly on call, coming in on my days off and staying late but getting in trouble for the amount of overtime I inevitably accrued.● Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with PNC are grossly under compensated for their role. We were expected to act as managers with barely an increase in salary from a basic full- or part-time teller.● Job security and advancementPNC always has opportunities for advancement but they will absolutely play favorites on who they allow to progress.● ManagementManagement, from branch to upper management, only care about meeting their sales goals. You are not a valued employee, you are a small part of a large machine. It does not matter if you are sick, overworked, in need of help from your management team, they are not there for you.● CultureIt was like walking back into high school, complete with cliques and double standards. If you want a professional career, avoid banking at the branch level with PNC unless you have the patience of a saint.● OverallOverall, I do not recommend PNC as a place to establish a professional career in banking or otherwise unless you are okay with playing the role of either yes man or scapegoat.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 3, 2020","1.0"

"Stretches Employees Thin","I was a 'part time' teller who was regularly scheduled 45+ hours a week. But they preach no overtime under any circumstance so I would often be there 6 days a week for 9+ hours a day, with 1-2 hour unpaid lunches where I just sort of sat around and waited to clock back in, all so I could stay under 39.75 hours, or god forbid they'd have to pay me benefits. I was told this was temporary as they were short staffed but this went on for the entire time I worked there. Within a few months of being there I was one of the senior-most tellers because the turnover rate was so high and everyone around me left. Management expects so much of you and it's impossible to meet all quotas and expectations. The customers are allowed to walk all over you and you just have to eat it with a smile. Management expects you to do the job of 3-4 people yet doesn't even pay well enough to cover the job you were hired to do. Worst job I've ever had.

"Job Has Pro's & Con's","Overall I feel as if it was a good job to gain more customer experience. The pro's to the job is the pay rate (pays really good for a entry level). The job is pretty stressful as well; you have to know how to deal with the constant yelling from customers and the constant changes within the company that you aren't notified of on time enough to explain to customers. You can't advance the way you would like to; you have to work a whole year to get your hours changed and their isn't any pay increase unless you change positions. Management is so so; sometimes they help but most of the time they aren't much help at all. Plus breaks are based off how busy the center is that day; sometimes you were on the phones for 3-4hours before your short break of 15mins. I liked the pay but otherwise it was just to many other problems that continued to happen. It was hard to follow the policy 100% correctly because it was so many constant changes going on plus you didn't have enough chances to correct anything before they'll write you up. I wouldn't recommend this job due to the amount of stress your put through and you don't get enough help from management.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","August 10, 2020","2.0"

In addition if you are coming into the company, ask for a lot because they may pay you  more than somebody who is getting a promotion.

"Decent work/life balance but overall you are just a number","I worked for PNC for over eleven years and yet I can sum up my thoughts on the company with one example and just a few sentences. In the department where I worked, the employees were grouped into teams which usually consisted of a dozen or so people, a team lead, and a manager. Our group of eight consultants and a team lead received a new manager after our manager retired. At the time, all nine of us had each been with the company for no less than ten years (and some over twenty). Within less than two years of this new manager taking over every single consultant and the team lead left by either transferring to another department, quitting, or retiring early. No one in upper management even noticed. The work itself isn't difficult but it does require a certain amount of knowledge and the training is insufficient. Communication between departments is chaotic and confusing and while the pay isn't terrible, raises are non-existent. As far as advancement, it depends on what department in the bank that you start from. If you begin in certain areas, no matter what degree or what experience you have you will be judged as being ""less than"" and forced to advance in baby steps, often making lateral moves. That being said, there are opportunities to work from home and overall the job is kind to working mothers and fathers/young families.","Loan Support Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 8, 2020","2.0"

"Workplace culture","There was no diversity at the branch I was employed at. Basically, there was preferential treatment towards a certain race.

"Great people to work with besides the manger.","The overall experience is great to just get started, but like anywhere with customer service, there will be some bad apple customers. But the manger will not have your back at all even if she says something her way and finds it wrong at a later date or even a few minutes after and will through all the blame on you. Claiming people come in late to work but she does not even open the bank on time and even with proof that you are there earlier than her she will still tell you to be earlier. The best way to explain is; you expect me to come into work on my computer ready to go with everything at 8:30 am, however, how am I to achieve that if you are rolling into the parking lot at 8:28 am. It is physically impossible. Overall very toxic. Also, the turn over rate in my five months working there was 8 people! Like how is that not a problem! Mind you my original plan was to stay there for three years to save money and maybe even move up the latter.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Newark, NJ","June 30, 2020","2.0"
"Good pay and Benefits. Good Schedule. ","The management in different branches is the biggest downfall of the company. The higher ups are great and very encouraging, but the lower end of management can sometimes be disrespectful and can play favorites. Over all, the pay for the work is outstanding as far as banking goes, and the work environment is fun within your coworkers as long as you build good relationships. It is important to follow the policies and to watch out for yourself, because sometimes, I did witness multiple people fired and punished for one persons mistake simply for staying quiet about a mess up.

"It's overall just an okay place to work, nothing spectacular.","I've been working at PNC for some time now and I can honestly say that I'm just ready for a fresh start with a new company. The pay is mediocre for the level of accountability and overall sales expectations. The incentives are not good at all. I'm bored at my location that I work at ALL the time.

"PNC is always trying to feed you","A Typical day at PNC includes being on the phones all day with your  two standard 15 min brakes and one 30 min lunch which fly by. Time moves so slowly when your on the floor, your on the phone taking about 150 phone calls per day.
I learned a tons there your in training every other month its a lot to take in at times but you get through it.
 the management is horrible there's never anyone around when you really need help and they have no issue throwing you under the bus to save their behind after they told you to do something. (always record your conversations while with management so you don't lose your job seen countless people fired for things they were told to do by management)
The workplace culture itself is pretty good when your dealing with other employees someone is always trying to feed you. 
the hardest part of the job would be taking the back to back calls and getting yelled at by customer's and trying to keep good quality scores which is hard to do because your graded on the call you took even if its a ball call, if you don't have thick skin this is not the job for you. You will be screamed at cursed at ect.
the most enjoyable part of the job is all the pot lucks like i said they love to feed you.","Fraud caseworker","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","March 11, 2020","3.0"

"Meh","Management is terrible. I've only been here less than a year and we've already gone through 4 managers. Sometimes, I feel like management makes up rules as they go.

"100% Micromanaged","I've been at PNC for about 3 months and not a day goes by without me thinking if I want to come to work or call out. The system that PNC has is extremely outdated; to get a statement, you would have to go to 3 systems to get there. Not only is the system outdated but so is the building and furniture. 
 Everything that you do here is micromanaged. With every customer, you have to write down their name and account number for a daily debrief where management would go over that and see where you had missed opportunities to make sales. You always have to click the insights whenever a customer is in front of you, if not, they get mad. They want to know why you wouldn't sell a 96 year old man a credit card. 
 There's also cold calls you have to do. Upper management expect you to make 100 dials a week and have at least 2 appointments daily. If it's a holiday or you were sick, you have to make up those dials when you come back. They worry more about the dials than customer service. 
 The training is horrible. They throw you into a pack of wolves with no protection. You learn while being on the job. Branch support will be your best friend because no one will help you. They also expect you to know everything about banking so you're able to deliver the insights. They would tell you to bring someone more seasoned into the conversations, but when you do, no one will reach out and you're made a fool out of yourself. 
 Sales goals is ridiculous. You would have think after the Wells Fargo controversy, PNC would cut down on the aggression of sales. I've worked for several banks and this - more...","Branch Banker","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","March 9, 2020","1.0"

"good but stressful","I enjoyed working at PNC but was taking the stress and anxiety of the job home with me and it was affecting my home life.

Working in treasury management, employees typically are in the office 40 hours / week with the flexibility to work from home as needed. Projects are interesting and expansive as the company is a full service bank. Advancement occurs fluidly but salary often doesn't follow as quickly.

"Run from them","This place is a joke. I've worked here for 15 years. Hard working loyal employee. I'm now actively looking for another job, should have done it years ago but I kept expecting them to figure it out and do the right thing. They literally give you a pay decrease after factoring in inflation year on year even with exceeds expectations or better and sometimes none at all. Their managers are told to average out 1 to 2 percent increases for everyone and will move you and your managers evaluation of you lower to fit that (not just in pay but performance). They do nothing for the good of the employee beyond what they are guilted into via industry pressures or PR. The decisions they make are short sighted. HR and incompetency has convinced them they don't need to actually pay employees. 1+ BILLION in pure profit a quarter (that's 4 times a year) for over a decade in a row and they don't pay their employees at all. It's astounding and incredible to me this is allowed to occur. It's unethical, immoral, and corrupt. I don't say these things lightly. It hurts. I've worked there for a long time.

"If you are PT you will work FT hours","Because of massive understaffing, they will hire you in at PT and then inform you that your schedule is ""subject to change"" - but you will not receive FT bonus payouts, FT benefits, or FT vacation perks. They DO NOT work with schedules, will not accommodate you if you have school, kids, etc. In my experience, PNC was not forthcoming about this information, which had they been during the time of my interview I would have saved myself and them some time and not taken the job.

Fall into the wrong project and you can be sidelined. They are the big fish in the market, so that makes it hard to negotiate salary once you're hired.

"Employees are just another number","Most managers in the region that I worked were not qualified to give the tools to help advance employees. They were either not motivated or simply not skilled.

I tried but no growth.","Banker","Former Employee","Chicago land area","January 30, 2020","1.0"
"Poor Management","Management does not appear to respect employees from the beginning: many interviews, sometimes no communication afterward, no return phone calls after demanding time prior to hiring; the largest concern is sales and what the employee can do for the company rather than ensuring the company also fits into some of the employee's needs for better morale. It's hypocritical to ask that customer facing employees perform perfectly while hiring managers and branch managers have little to no people or communication skills, lack of etiquette, and lack of basic courtesy. Not everyone that applies to PNC carries a nothing more than a high school diploma and there are people in the workforce who would like to be treated with some form of dignity. If you live in Southern Maryland and you would like to be treated fairly and with respect, look and apply elsewhere.

As an in store sales associate, you were required to walk around grocery store and try to get people to open up accounts/ credit cards. Management was fairly new and didn't offer support. Their main response was ""what can I do to help you get more customers?"" Bank was very short staffed and you are often found alone with little to no support should issues arise when you are new.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Middletown, NJ","January 29, 2020","1.0"

I have been working until 10 pm every night, it has stressed my family out to where they cant take it anymore that they never see me but for a couples hours here and there EVEN when I work from home.

"Good place to start a career for the most part","Overall this is a  great job to grow with. I would recommend going in as a plat form member though. Being a teller means you have the most transaction in the bank. Meaning they constantly set high goals for you to reach.which wouldn't be bad, but they keep making it harder to hit the incentive goal. meaning you don't get the incentive pay. Since i started they have taken 3 things away that would've been a referral for us. meaning now its even hard to hit the goal. also when you are hired on, they say it isn't a sales job, but it really is. They want us to push credit card offers, and that's fine and all, but asking the same person more than once is rude. especially when its not in the customers best interest all the time. We also don't get a lot of new customers in the branch. most of them are older, or have some debt. Generally those customers do not want a new credit card. But we are told to ask and make sure they leave with a hand out.  even if you hit your referral goals, its never good enough..","Teller","Current Employee","Springfield, OH","January 28, 2020","4.0"
"Good benefits, mediocre compensation, difficult to advance to upper management","PNC Bank in my opinion is a good starting ground. Advancing in lower positions is very achievable, but advancing to upper management is impossible... The pay is okay, not the highest, but still better than most. Incentive plan is mediocre, unless in a very high traffic/ high net worth area. Benefits like healthcare and vacation are very good. Work culture is inviting, but certain policies in place allow for employees to slack and really not get punished (my own branch experiences).","Branch Sales and Service Associate I","Current Employee","Vero Beach, FL","January 27, 2020","3.0"

The goal is to reach out to others branches for help but they are barley staffed themselves. Upper management doesn't care about employees career path all they want to make sure you are getting Credit Card applications on a daily basis and investment referrals.It is all about what PNC can get.

 You are rated and scored with each call that can make assisting customers somewhat stressful, because they don't want you on each call too long but what the customers needs met. It is a very stressful balancing act with each situation.

There's been times we've received bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry they can't get their way, and it's tanked our bonuses that we received and earned.

What is truly best for the customer is secondary to production and pushing PNC products and services.  As an employee, you are not encouraged to think outside the box but are very encouraged to drink the corporate Kool-Aid, shut up and do what you're told.

Onboarding and off boarding process is awful, no KT or directing new employee to the right work flow. It is imposible to find any documentation related to the project. Poor weak hardware laptop is proveded for automation with Windows 7 (later upgrated to 10) system which is glitching periodicaly. Scrum master's answer is 'I don't know' for any question. Management system is in very unprofessional level and not orgonized. Developers' manager doesn't understand overall concepts of developing and hiring devs with backend background for frontend project. A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing, more truly, they come to have their lunch, drink coffee/tea, and wash their dishes afterall. There is no proper environment for testing, everything should be tested in devs' machine which is unstable and available from time to time. So many mess is in whole Sprint duration. Releases are constantly postponed due to other dependencies. PNC's new up to date web application cannot emerge because of all these kind of issues in management.  If you try to open PNC web app you will see old design which is even not responsive. I wonder whether the stakeholders aware about the lame PNC application. I can continue to criticize every detail of PNC working process for a long time but want to say pnc manager could fire employee for no reason even everything is done on time and properly. Instead of appreciation employee could get fired or get stress.","TCoE test lead","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 18, 2019","1.0"

"West orange northfield branch management was the worst","I've been in the career of banking for roughly 6 years. I've NEVER experienced such poor leadership in my life to compare to the one in this branch. I've never had a manager tell me to my face 'the business comes before you' when I express a  concern of lack of work/life balance in the workplace. Due to my recent life event changes of me having to move to a different state, I applied to PNC. When I arrived to my interview 15 minutes early we'll prepared after driving for 2 hours from my hotel to get there, I was told to wait an additional 30 minutes after my scheduled time because she wasn't ready. The branch manager was completely unprofessional. She told me she's 'stretching the interview longer' within 10 minutes of the interview by adding unnecessary conversation because i told her of my drive time. On my drive back, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job after I clear for drug testing. Flash forward to me actually working at the West Orange, NJ branch... I was expected to work 6 days a week (some leave the branch at 7pm some nights)M-S, wear a suit, reach high sales goals, be a banker, be a teller... etc. The job is do-able. But when management is constantly over your shoulder, throwing mini tantrums when things don't go her way, disrespecting her colleagues... it makes you not want to come to work. After I wasn't told lunch breaks were 45 minutes not an hour, I had the manager CALL ME WHEN IM OFF THE CLOCK 50 minutes into my break to ask me to come back in. There's no space. And the fact that management didn't allow me to continue doing training & jump into - more...","Universal Banker","Former Employee","West Orange, NJ","November 17, 2019","1.0"

I was here for 12 months and witnessed too many mid level managers leave either on their own accord or they were let go due to reorganization.

"Good for people who like sales","PNC loves to tell their employees that they do not sales push. I am here to tell you other wise. I am aware that in banking there needs to be money coming in in order to grow. However, It is shoved down our throats that we need to click the ""insight"" button for each and every client that comes in. The insight button is an automated message that tells you what to say to the client in regards to opening new accounts, credit cards, investments and so on. If you do not click the insight button you are reprimanded. They pull numbers to see how many transactions you did, how many times you clicked the button, and if the client got any new products. It is very stressful. Bonuses? HAH. They tell you that you can get incentive pay if you receive 5 stars on surveys....never got that. It is a total score for the entire branch. If one person receives a not so good review you can kiss that bonus good bye. They make a lot of promises but honestly they make it impossible to reach their expected goals.

I literally go home and have nightmares over my workplace environment- not reaching my goals, work being left out, upper management. PNC has affected my personal mental health more than I care to admit, as I know it has done to others, the evidence is all in the incredibly high turnover rate.

"Good Remote Job and Traditional Blend","This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met. Lots of autonomy with getting job done! Products and services of bank are very strong too as PNC leads in several spaces. The people are nice to work with within the retail and commercial branch network but the company is disjointed from its legacy culture in Pittsburgh.
 The company has restructured incentives to significantly decrease incentive pay. Incentive pay for this role is also dependent on far away teammate performance and not pay for individual performance which can leave the BDO doing double duty to make up for teammate performance if they want a pay-out. There's no remedy for this.
 There's no real career trajectory outside of retail side of bank. Management skill level for this line of business is below average often resorting to pitting teammates against one another, openly disparaging partner lines of business & individual people. There's a severe lack of emotional IQ, and extreme passive aggressiveness that thwarts productivity and lowers team morale.","OUT OF BRANCH BANKING","Former Employee","Atlanta, GA","September 17, 2019","3.0"

This place takes the cake for hypocrisy because public facing marketing tells one story but once you get in, it's the complete opposite. 100% turnover is commonplace. Don't believe me? Walk into any branch in the Atlanta Metro Region and survey how long people have worked there outside of management. Ask what turn over is like in general and if it's common to have turnover. Ask if the branch is fully staffed and how long it has been that way. There were branches that could not even open the doors on a consistent basis without redirecting employees from their regular home branch to cover others because of being short staffed.

Turns out I didn't Open an account correctly and literally got told off infront of the customer and humiliated.) I had enough of the lack of training and that awful experience made me contact HR but With me being within the 90 day period I felt I didn't matter because it took over a week for a response. I ended up calling her out and the branch manager came in and tried to blame it on me not trying to listen to there 'teachings'. They would threaten me about 90 days coming up and me having to take it seriously. Keep in mind I literally had to stand in the lobby half of my day. I was setup for failure and humilated and harassed ( they would tell me I can't touch my beard and talk about how I would sit when making calls).

We have 2 trainers, one whom was great the other, not so great. The time off is a complete nightmare for anyone who has kids. You have to be there a year before you receive any PTO and if you have to take time off before then you receive an 'occurrence'. Being a previous manager at bank, I do understand the need and responsibility of being at work and being on time, but I also understand that life happens. If you get to many of these occurrences you'll be terminated. After your 7 weeks of training you go into transition for 5 weeks for is a full 6 hours on the phones with ONE 15 minute break. I was told I needed a note from my doctor if I had to get up and use the bathroom an 'excessive' amount of times. If I hadn't of had previous banking experience, this job would have been difficult for me to learn as they do not explain the in's and out's of banking very well.

From the first month there I realized PNC was not very different from my previous company in regards to management. They have managers that go by advice from senior employees, some of them should not be in any position to give management advice. I was told I was ready to go to my new location, then 3 days later told I was not. Then I found out from other employees that the person who was training me was not happy I was to be replacing them. They lied and falsified information, including sending fake emails about my position! This kept me from fulfilling the position I was hired for. 
 I found out after I left the next person to replace my position also was treated unfairly and quit due to this same situation, by the same employee!
 I would definitely make sure you have asked and gotten every question answered before accepting a position there. Although I left my previous company in good standing I could not go back, as my position had been filled. I ended up not only losing my seniority, but my 401k match, my PTO of 6 weeks, all my benefits, including stock purchase options.
 My advice to management is make sure you have honest employees, with integrity giving your branch managers advice, especially if they do not like the new employee(s). In life you will not like everyone you work with, not everyone will like you, but working with others in a professional manner is what grownups do!","Universal Banker Ill","Former Employee","South Florida, FL","August 20, 2019","1.0"

The problem is with the middle managers. They run around frightened, micromanage and are generally unprofessional.  There are many managers who are not qualified for their positions. 
 Culture is also an issue at PNC. After buying several other banks over the years, they are just now trying to build a single culture.

If you miss one  ""meet all expectations"" you cannot apply for any other positions within PNC as one of the questions you have to answer when applying for a promotion (step-up job) is ""What was the lowest score on your last semi annual review"".

There is an internal job sight for other positions at PNC, however the descriptions are so vague you don't know what you're actually applying to do.  Even when you finally get an interview, there isn't much clarity around what the job is. Management feels it isn't their job to be able to help their employees when they are overwhelmed or need help.  There is no work life balance because you're expected to work until the daily work is finished even if it takes 10 hours that day but management leaves at 2pm.

Also, be prepared for them to just make up policies out of the blue that are not in writing anywhere and are not used by any other region.

Regional Manager focuses on weaknesses and missed opportunities without congratulating strengths and accomplishments. I used to love my branch and the clients and I wanted to advance with them, but they make it impossible to get a promotion.

 However, I found support to be tenuous when it mattered.  Although training was very good, there was not sufficient warnings against job-ending errors and infractions (mine included).  In my short time, I've seen experienced tellers, bankers, and advisors forced into retirement and terminated with very thin cause to do so.  It can be a nice place to work, but beware.","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Ohio","July 22, 2019","3.0"

HR & Ethics is a bunch of bologna. Don't take anything into consideration, automatically sides with the NEWLY employed manager from BOA whom always puts down her employees and talks about them to other employees... one bad customer service survey will put you in the red for the whole year and that is held against you for any raises or promotions! I should know! I had 18 shops! 17 perfect and ONE not!! Can't make them all happy!! But it was held against me and I was told that I needed to make an action plan to better my client experience! Save yourself the headache! My co-workers, including myself dread going to work everyday! It was never like this prior! We all enjoyed the place we worked!

"Great benefits, but my manager clearly didn't want me to advance","I have only worked here about 5 months but it's an incredibly easy job. I have been told by every coworker that i am the fastest teller to catch on. I talked to my manager about opportunities to advance and at first it was 6 months recommended but not required, then it was required 6 months, then it was 6 months to a year. I just don't like that although she says she succeeds when her staff succeeds she isn't actually doing anything to help that happen. She also tells me it's because I haven't mastered my position but tells me nothing that I can do to fix that. The teller lead is also very petty. She doesn't like doing her job and takes her sweet time greeting drive through, but gets snippy if we don't do it the second it happens. I think she's just insecure with her position because I honestly don't see how she is qualified for it. They promote people who don't follow the rules, but hold people back who have been told that they are the best teller there. It makes no sense.
 It's a great job if you don't get bored easily and you don't mind not advancing quickly. The benefits are great though and I'm very happy with the multiple health care options and the paid time off.","TELLER","Current Employee","PA","July 21, 2019","4.0"

"Terrible","PNC starts off great, leaves you with high hopes for your future. You do pretty intense training but it is basically just how to use the extremely out of date software. After training, you are expected to know the ins and out of banking. No real training on the things you deal with day to day.  Schedule changes daily and although you are told you have to work 1 Saturday a month, you end up working 3 if not 4. Upper management and HR is useless.","Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Yardley, PA","July 14, 2019","2.0"
"A place to build experience","What I have learned about PNC is that the executives and upper management are highly guaranteed raises and advancement. While the lower management within the company gives praises for the employees work it is hard to move up if you are not a favorite.

The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers.","OPERATIONS ANALYST II","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA","July 13, 2019","3.0"

Shareholders love PNC, because PNC never spends money. That means no training opportunities, travel, or perks.

"Overall the company is not bad; beware of bad management","PNC overall is not a bad place to work (depending on your location and the turnover rate.) They have employee awards and events to attend. Volunteer hours that you get back as paid time off. They don't like overtime so you're more likely to leave on time and not have to worry about work after leaving.
 I went without a branch manager for well over half a year, picked up the slack, took care of things that I could. I wanted a position that involved operations and being a banker because I was doing the work without the compensation. I was denied. I then left the company and they put up an open position for operations and banker (the position I wanted) because they realized it was better to have a single banker do the excess rather than having the manager do everything and 4 bankers try to resolve audits, filing, etc.

I myself work from home 2 days a week, and I have 4 weeks of vacation time, swing holidays, and sick time.  The only problems I have ever had with the company is the pay is generally on the low end of the scale compared to some competitors, but I have found the pension and other benefits make up for this. The organization is constantly changing as they expand into the West, so some positions change, butnif you are a hard worker, they will be sure you are moved to where you need to be in the company during these changes.","Loan Support Analyst","Current Employee","Miamisburg, OH","July 1, 2019","5.0"

You get in trouble you don't know why you got in trouble days later or months later. There was so many Tech issues thats not coded off a responsible for having Tech issues. I learned more by being on the phones and teach myself than I did from the training. a lot of information i was told to was wrong he had to figure out alone. Customer are at you because of fees, phone supervisors don't want you to ask for help. Other departments don't want to take designated call and your tl will ignore you if your numbers aren't high.

"Think twice before you go to PNC","Let me start by saying... I was not fired and I do not have an axe to grind with PNC. I spent a few years there and it was one of the most highly disorganized places to work with unrealistic goals. They will promise you the world but never deliver on their end of the bargain. When I was there the turnover was the worst I have ever seen. They could not keep anyone staffed. they moved new leadership down from Pittsburgh to change the direction of the bank. The senior leadership team could careless about the employees. They only care about hitting goals at ANY cost.The entire state of NC is ran by people who treat the employees like livestock. They use you and dispose of you when you no longer hit the unrealistic goals. They will write you up and fire you at the drop of a hat.  PNC has almost no market share in NC but they will expect you to produce the same numbers as your counterparts in Pittsburgh. Makes little to no sense. Everyone that is in a sales role there is miserable and constantly looking for a way out. I am happily employed at a smaller community bank and could not be happier.

"They basically treat you like children...","It was mostly my trainer/facilitator that turned me off after I accepted my new position. First off, I was expecting the typical call center environment, but I was not expecting the whole brainwash theatrics regarding how rewarding it is to work for $15.00 an hour (which is still considered poverty level) and how much PNC bank and its CEO want you to succeed and move up within their company. Of course, working for someone else will always keep them at the top, and you as a replaceble employee, so please spare me. Anyways, my facilitator talked about how micromanaging is what they do not do - that was a lie. She literally admitted to moving/zooming our cameras around during virtual training in order to see if we were on our phones and/or doing other things. One day, my system froze, and I could not click my camera back on when we returned from break, so I told her (via phone) that I was here but may have to restart my computer due to it being frozen. She responds passive aggressively by stating ""we returned from break a few minutes ago but thanks for telling me"". Ma'am, we returned from break at 9:48AM. It is now 9:50AM. I tried to get the computer to work for 2 minutes before saying anything; sorry if that was too long. 
 They basically treat you like children by constantly threatening to report those two minute ""tardies"" to the Line of Business. Who really cares?   
 The only thing I am glad about is that I did not accept a full time offer. That way, I do not spend all day working a position I am unhappy with.

I could not sell lines of credit to them, that they could not afford. I couldnt sell home equity lines of credit to people who were renting, mostly in a fixed income complex.

"Wouldn't recommend unless desperate","Besides the other employees at the branch where I worked and my manager it was very stressful. The support was the worst, I've worked in previous banks and when needing to contact support were always reliable. Then comes PNC and all they do is email you a link and be like there you go. Defeats the purpose of calling and requesting support. This place has the worst training, it's broken off in monthly or bimonthly training sessions. So while you're already working at the branch taking care of some customers with other it's like I can't help you with that despite working here for more than 3 months I haven't done my training to use the software to open an account, or be able to submit an application for another 2 months once you do training on loans.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Georgia","May 28, 2019","2.0"

"Last resort of Banks to work for","Employed 3 years, wasn't trying to make career of it. pay was ok at first . Based on your yearly performance you may get a raise here and there but they are the lowest paying banks. It's all about politics with this company. Atleast the Baltimore region that is. you won't advance unless you sucker up to the big wigs and Exceed sale goals. They definitely are all about the numbers. forget the effort . Overall the managers suck. Yes they are under a lot of pressure but majority of them aren't qualified. Managers don't know how to be respectful or simple duties of the job but are hired but then leave or fired not to long after. The benefits are ok, not for if you have a big family. They definitely are conniving. Don't trust anyone . If the company feels like your time has come to an end or whatever the case they will find something to terminate you over, no warning or anything. Doesn't matter how long you have been there or sales or good employee. A lot of secretive unexplainable things will happen and nothing you can do. All they care about is revenue. And give you a little tiny raise to make up for treating you like nothing. Personal life is out the Question. There would be some that would work every day and weekend. But Ofcourse not allowed overtime. Job was very draining and led a lot of people to depression or quitting. Definitely do not stay longer than 1 or 2 yrs if you wanna maintain your sanity. Get the training and leave as soon as you can, preferably another bank . They'll pay more and be happy you're already experienced.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","Baltimore, MD","May 22, 2019","2.0"

"Good People, Stressful workplace","I worked at two different PNC's within the 1 year that I worked there. I worked in Dayton Oho, on Main street and then in Pittsburgh my hometown. PNC was the first job I got out of college. It wasn't in my field but I felt it was a great job to start out with, and a way to learn and network. I learned ALOT working at PNC, I barely new how to read large numbers, right out checks, I didn't know what a cash advanced was or money market. So I'm very thankful for what I learned. But both managers I had made the job extremely stressful. My manger in Ohio was very demanding, intimidating, and rude. Several workers left the branch under her watch, My manager in Pittsburgh wasn't really a team player and she was never in the branch, it seemed like she would purposely make herself busy so she wouldn't have to be around us or customers, She was very back and fourth with rules. People kept leaving and transferring from that branch to . including our lead teller, so once she left me and one other girl had to basically be the lead teller and take on all the responsibilities without being paid extra or being trained really.","Teller","Former Employee","Dayton, OH","May 19, 2019","3.0"

"Not a Good place for Work/ Life Balance","Not a Good place for Work/ Life Balance. I was hired as a permanent employee to work at the Branch in North Seminole county, not as a float staff. They would wait until I got to the office to tell me they needed me in West Orange County. The drive alone was over an hour. They should have let me know the day prior if there was a staffing issue.  If I said anything about it I was pulled in the office and told I was not a team player and that I was embarrassing the manager.","Consumer Bank Consultant","Former Employee","Sanford, FL","May 14, 2019","3.0"
"Fair Enough","The people who work at PNC are what makes it great.  It's a shame that the organization doesn't put more value on their human capital.

"Great to learn all the different loan types","Nothing positive to say about them. It was a great opportunity to learn the mortgage business however PNC had a lot of Racist and friend based promotions on the operation end of the business. On the servicing end of the business it was more diverse.","Loan Processor","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 14, 2019","1.0"

"Great place to work, management is not where it should be.","I love my job. The pay was great and the benefits weren't that bad either. The job lacked management and consistency.

"None","Nothing good to say about PNC Bank.  No work life balance.

"Stressful...tellers are forced to sell products","I liked being a teller, however PNC forces tellers to push products on every single customer, even those you would see ever day.  Tellers should be able to provide customer service, not pushing products the customers don't ask for or want.  To this day I have flashback nightmares of my manager criticizing our work. For this they paid a full time teller 9$ an hour. Benefits were good, as they should be at a large company.   Every day we had a morning meeting on performance, what to push to customers, and Pnc calls customers for feedback on employee performance and if you got less than 5 out of 5 you were not doing good enough.  Also, as a teller, we had to cold call customers after work periodically to sell them financial services.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Chestertown, MD","May 13, 2019","1.0"
"Benefits","PNC Bank provides opportunities to grow in your career and benefits to support the initiative.  Unfortunately those benefits and opportunities are generally located in the larger areas with a higher concentration of employees, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

"Great Pay, Amazing boss","I was a Loan Closer with PNC I loved my boss, she did not micromanage, and she was encouraging.  The pay I received while I was there was a good pay rate per hour.  Job security however leaved much to be desired, they would cut anyone and everyone at the drop of a dime.  They would not even offer other positions within the company before getting rid of you.  Other than that it was a good experience.","Senior Loan Processor","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 9, 2019","3.0"
"Good workplace","Direct managers are wonderful to work with. My manager takes an active interest in my development with my career and me personally.

"Horrible","Pros:
- My co-workers was the main reason why I didn't leave right away. They were nice and helpful.
 Cons:
- Management was a mess. We didn't have a manager for 6+ months.
- The branch that I worked at was very busy and understaffed.
- Always running out of supplies. For instance, deposit and withdrawal slips, pens, cups, etc. 
- No paid time off for part-time until you've worked there for a year. 
- They'll also fire if you do one thing wrong without any warnings. I've seen it happen to two of my co-workers.","Teller","Former Employee","Gaithersburg, MD","May 6, 2019","2.0"

"Stay away from PNC!","I have worked in the mortgage industry for 20 years. And this was the worst experience of my entire career. PNC is unethical  and lack any sense of moral compass. 
  The way they treat their employees is actually illegal. And several ex-employees have filed lawsuits against the company. Stay far far away from PNC.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","May 4, 2019","1.0"
"Sales not Management","Position in store (Giant).  Long hours, typically short staffed.  Focus was on sales, approaching shopping customers, ridiculous activities in front of branch to stop Giant customers.  Emphasis on selling instead of employee development or customer service. Massive pressure from upper management to meet sales goals. If you are looking for a respectable banking job this it NOT it.","Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager","Former Employee","VA","May 3, 2019","1.0"
"Im Surprised they are still in business","There is so much to say about my experience with this company but to sum it up.  The company does not set you up for success at all.  I personally did succeed but at the cost of my health physically and mentally. The training does absolutely nothing to prepare you for the actually job.  The 1-2 week training basically just shows you the systems you will be working with. THATS IT.  For the 3 years I was there management changed the processes about twice a month; sometimes more. I am all for being flexible with change but it was just ridiculous after a while. On top of it they want you to keep up with every wishy washy change they made and reprimand you for every mistake. Every day I felt like I may lose my job if I'm not perfect. The company also changed the incentive structure every year to make it more difficult to bonus. I was a Processor and there were just so many things outside out control, but we got blamed for every thing that happened.  I would never recommend anyone work here and I will never work for them again. I honestly feel the company as a whole did not care about their customers and every decision they made was a guess.  they have all these kind of special projects testing out new processes or systems but when it comes down to implementing real feed back they don't listen to the people who actually do the job every day. Also, as an employee so many managers have favorites.","Senior Loan Processing Analyst","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 2, 2019","2.0"
"Avoid the pnc aml department at all cost!","I worked for PNC as an AML Investigator in the Pittsburgh office (1st Side Center) for a number of years.  I've also had similar titles at another bank and have been a professional in Risk Management for over a decade.  
 At first, I thought the work culture was friendly and the program seemed fairly organized.  The department was expanding its AML program considerably and hiring more investigators and support staff to handle a large increase in case volume.  
 Within six months, they had the new hires working 12+ hours a day and were expected to handle case volumes far beyond what the vast majority of people could handle.  During the worst of it, you were expected to clear about 10-16 case in a week. From what I was told, prior to the case increases and hiring push,  investigators were expected to work between 5-8 cases a week.  
 There were a few dips in the case volume moving forward but largely  the average that you would work in a given month increased as time when by.  All the while, there was little or no improvements to the policies and procedures that would help us do the work faster and with more efficiency.  In other words, you were expected to do a lot more with less.
 PNC tries to solve any problem by hiring more managers. The most frustrating part about working there is most of the Team Leads and Managers are absolutely terrible and all they care about are metrics. Some of the stuff I've heard managers say I can honestly say I've never come across in my entire professional life.  It was like living in a cult. The Team Leads there may have been good at clearing - more...","AML Investigator","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 2, 2019","1.0"
"Schedule Adherence","Don't do it unless you have no kids, don't get sick, running late by 1 min!!! Schedule adherence is unrealistic if you are stuck on a call during your 15 minutes you risk being off your adherence and no bonus they give you! You get the same calls all day sometimes from the same folks with their online banking system causing customers to be locked out multiple times a week and there is no script to follow. Oh yeah and if you want to last there you must not be late or miss days the first 90 days!","Call Center Representative","Former Employee","Virtual","May 1, 2019","1.0"

"Tactical, next flashy thing management style","Management is engrained in the tactical day to day operations and has no vision or strategy.  Management speaks of work/life balance as something that will come in the years to come if we work hard today.  It takes 4-5 months to get an approved work effort approved to begin.

All she did was click things on my computer without showing me how its done and when I asked for help they always had an attitude.  I learned about important cash limits 4 months into my employment.  The other tellers all did things that violated PNC policies and when I made the mistake I was yelled at when I was just doing what everyone else does due to lack of training.  I had a Panic attack in the middle of a transaction because once again they left me with something I wasn't trained in and got yelled at by my manager on why am I crying and why cant I calm down .

No one , right ? I think nobody deserves such mistreatment. I believe on being nice with people, not rude like her. And on top of that I received an email saying that I wasn't hired.

Management does not care if you have any sort of sickness. Training was a nightmare and we sat in a classroom for 3 weeks. One of the most important things you learn at the last minute. Also the material you learn in the classroom doesn't even get used while you're on the call or are told that it is incorrect. They do not reimburse you if you work from home.

On a typically week, you would be making around 60 cold calls to try and get people to make an appointment to come into the branch.

Also, if there is a difference in anyone's cash drawer, everyone working that day have to stay until the mystery of the missing or extra cash has been resolved. There were plenty of times we had fun and weren't too stressed but those times are rare. The branch I was in was very busy so serious yet smiling faces had to always be present.

From the time you log in to CATCH and turn on Spirit, the calls will be back-to-back with calls regarding disputes, transactions, etc. This bank has some terrible fees was well. There's a saying in the company regarding ""Overdraft Tuesdays"" when customers would notice a positive balance in their accounts from Friday thru Monday, then Tuesday the funds are gone. The customer is under the impression that their balance wasn't negative over the weekend. This is just one of many issues that PNC needs to update and fix. Too many bogus expectations there as well. You can have a whole week of good calls, but the audit team will find your worst call and grade you on that, so they won't give you your deserved bonus. The team leads have their teams working like busy-bees so that their ""manager's"" numbers can look good. One thing that I did like was the small cafe and the self-service store in the building.

Because the  majority of them have limited skills, all good people, being managed by them, leave.  So the people who stick around and get seniority, and are the next generation of management, are pretty lackluster.  Truly capable technical people are too valuable to be allowed to leave the legacy apps they have patched repeatedly and are left in place.
 Unfortunately, Senior management's preferred solution to any project is to add more management.  They do not take the time to really know what is going on and function as a sheltered clique unto themselves.","Senior Software Engineer","Former Employee","Cleveland, Ohio","January 18, 2019","1.0"

"It was a great entry point for someone new to banking","Initial training was well done and thorough.  You spent time training at job start then would weave work/training together as you start the first few months.  The UBC position was just rolling out at the time, so there was a big push to get many employees (new/old) up to speed on being a teller/platform associate.  Once on goal, you had to make a sales minimum to get paid your bonus.  Some were fortunate to work in busier branches than others.  They implemented a cold calling program about mid-way through my tenure to gain appointments with existing customers.  In this type of setting, you were always trying to involve yourself with customers- so everybody was looking over their shoulder.  Management was good and there was decent pressure to perform, not overwhelming.  Many of the best employees would leave for better positions with other banks.  That was told to me at an early stage, and it came true for me as well.  I was grateful for the training and mentoring I received there.  It definitely helped get my next job.","UNIVERSAL BRANCH CONSULTANT","Former Employee","Chapel Hill, NC","December 10, 2018","3.0"
"Communication and focus could be improved","Each group ion PNC operates in a silo and there seems to be no will to change that.

"N/a","PNC Bank is a great place to work for entry level positions. I have learned a great deal throughout my tenure there through coaching, development, and collaborative team efforts. Upper management however is out of touch and does not seem to care for their employees much more than a number. There's a great deal of micro management and conference calls. The most enjoyable piece of the bank is servicing the clients of the bank.","Business Banking Center Branch Manager","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","December 6, 2018","3.0"

"Poor management and poor pay","It's laughable that Pnc tries to preach employee financial wellness but chooses to pay $35/k a year for a risk job and a degree. Raises only occur if you meet all expectations and my raise was $400 added to my salary for the YEAR. Not a livable wage.
 My management team had both good and bad. High turnover because of the poor management and poor communication. Management does not care about the people under them., are defensive and take things personally. One boss even specifically told us not to talk on our lunch break sitting at our desk because he was in a bad mood. Management is constantly in meetings and never available. 
 The team was great and there are a lot of great people. People coming in from the outside have more opportunities than those within because they don't have a 'meets some' rating on their reviews. A lot of people get those meets some and can't get a raise or advance within because other departments won't interview with that on their file. 
 Be ready for change. Our department was constantly going they departmental changes and process changes. Technology is a joke. You need multiple programs to do your job and nothing works cohesively or just will not work at all sometimes. Pnc's IT is awful. Training was minimal, however, you have 'errors' that work against you and either screw you or those who are in Quality review. 
 The benefits are okay. The best thing is the maternity leave. After one year, you can receive 12 weeks 100% paid and can also have a few weeks with parental leave which is 100% paid. 
 This was just from my specific department.","Detection and Investigation analyst","Former Employee","Brecksville, OH","December 5, 2018","2.0"

"PNC is a bad place to work","My experience working for PNC was not the best. The management is allowed to retaliate against the workers if they take disputes to upper management.

Pay isn't great, hours aren't great, lunch isn't paid, branch stay open late and somehow I almost always ended up closing and getting home at 7pm (banker hours apparently).

"Predatory Capitalism","PNC is not atypical within corporate America -- but it is certainly just as appalling and unethical as any other bank, it simply wields many jargon-laced smoke screens with which to shield itself. My manager barely acts like a human being. In fact, almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments) are human-like at all. Speaking to them, it's like there is not a single genuine bone in their body, like the humanity has been slowly winnowed out of their soul. I've sat in on meetings and calls where not a single direct, or useful, thing was said in two entire hours. 
 They are attempting to turn their employees into jargon-spewing monsters, too; utter automatons. Positioning and capability statements are gross and no one - particularly not younger people - will ever be drawn in by an in-person commercial delivered by a robotic employee. With the heavy sales focus, we are highly incentivized to focus all of our attention to wealthy clients while ignoring the impoverished and those with genuine need. The overdraft fees are predatory and atrocious - and PNC is content to continue to milk the elderly and physically disabled for fees that continue to make their financial life a source of stress and chaos. 
 I've been tempted to recommend customers like that to another bank. 
 I genuinely hope that when younger people garner the reins of power from institutions like these, that the bloodsucking corporate leeches are thrown out. 
 Also, voiceCX is terrible. Please stop basing your employees confidence on the COMPLETELY arbitrary whims - more...","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 16, 2018","2.0"

"Pushed to Sell! Unrealistic Expectations","My manager was very nice. But his manager(the regional) wasn't. The atmosphere is pretty competitive among coworkers but as far as the company, you're expected to sell sell sell, even when there are no new customers. It's nonstop standing the entire time, which was unexpected since I picture platform bankers sitting behind a desk.

"Collaborative working environment with questionable leadership","PNC has a strong culture of inclusion and collaboration. However, the lack of process and reliance on relationships as a means of getting business done is ineffective post merger with National City. Leadership direction is unclear and often plagued with lack of prioritization. Collaborative bend has created a culture of decision (or more accurately indecision) by committee. Roles and responsibilities are not always clear, decision makers hard to identify. The organization is not nimble or fast-paced, slowed somewhat by regulatory requirements but otherwise by self-imposed bureaucracy. People are nice, willing to help - but slow to provide constructive feedback. It rates high for me personally due to work-life balance with flexibility options to meet both professional and personal needs.","Operations Group Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 1, 2018","3.0"

"Avoid this place","So when I worked for them in the begining it seemed ok but for your training they send you far and the travel is a nightmare then policy and procedure seemed to change daily so forget what you learned cause it will change without notice which makes you look stupid helping the customers. They say they want to do whats right for the client when the sales goals are pushed on them so much that you are then forced to do whats not right for them just to get them off your back and to still have a job. Turn over was so high and management has favorites that when they continuously do bad they keep letting it happen. Don't expect a raise ever if your surveys aren't a perfect 5 and you must meet your ridiculous sales goals as well. No room to advance and running around for nothing and dont believe banker hours when you hear it, no such thing. Long hours and then the BM would keep you after hours and also expect you to do events and reach out as well so no work life balance whatsoever. I say keep looking and don't bother with this unprofessional place just keep clear of this place.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Batavia, IL","November 1, 2018","1.0"

"Professional workplace environment, lacking in employee compensation","At this position i would handle anywhere from 35-55 loan applications, assigned directly to me.

However, the most enjoyable part was the hours and the environment. It was a very relaxed, friendly, fun environment that let you work at your own pace.

"Good People Bad Management","Overall there are a lot of good people at PNC.  Some of the higher up management doesn't have a grasp of what is actually going on.  They ""sell"" their new products to higher management, and bring in outside workers from prior employment to push their new products along.  It's not allowing current employees a chance to learn and grow.","None","None","Team Lead (Current Employee)","Pittsburgh, PA","3.0"

"Great starting 9-5 job!","I worked for PNC as a teller. I learned how to manage multiple tasks at once, answer phone calls, keep up with policy changes, work with others on tasks, customer service, etc. I've learned a lot that can stat-stuff my resume for other career opportunities. You also have multiple ways to earn extra money through incentives.
 However, being on the frontline and having to keep up with everything I just mentioned can be a real headache at times. Multiple scenarios and tasks can be thrown at you all at once. The hardest thing for me was learning policy and procedure just for it to change as soon as you get used to it, then having to explain that to a customer.
 Overall, I loved my time there at PNC.

"Lots of inexperienced or poor managers, politics & antiquated, slow technology & manual processes","I've worked in several different areas and all have many inconsistent & cumbersome manual processes.  And project-related decisions take too long due to the need for multiple levels of management input and approval & key stakeholders don't attend status meetings or read minutes, so r unfamiliar with all the issues & either take weeks to give a final decision or make a rushed decision not taking the necessary time to understand the complexity or consequences of their decisions. PMs r too inexperienced to demand stakeholder attendance. If you speak truth to power (e.g there's no way this work can be done properly in the time given) u will be shunned, criticized by your manager for being negative & not being a 'team player' & will be written up on your annual review. Systemic dysfunction at its worst!  Managers love to play Monday night quarterback when something goes wrong never recognizing (or admitting) that they made the final go ahead decision. No support for fresh new ideas or alternative solutions, which is so  typical of a large bureaucratic bank. After u start working there, even when u make or exceed expectations, annual increases don't keep up with cost of living.  With the keyword being EXPECTATIONS; even when u improve year to year, they will slightly tweek their expectations so as to not give too many 'exceeds' or 'greatly exceeds' ratings as mgr. r limited to only a small % of employees that can be rated 'exceeds' or 'greatly exceeds', so only their buddies & sycophants get that rating.

"Horrible","PNC was a horrible place to work. The management was rude, condescending and there was minimal training before you were graded and chastised for your poor performance. The pay was far too low for the amount of responsibility employees were given ($11/hr but handling upwards of $300,000 in cash daily). Employees are expected to sell products but never given any training on what PNC has to offer or how those products work, yet you are expected to meet daily, monthly, and quarterly sales goals. Employees are paid commission, but you have to work for the company for at least 6 months before it is paid out, and it is paid out a quarter behind, so you won't see any commission for nearly a year. The company does regular and mandatory performance reviews and goal setting, but no options for advancement are ever given and no raises are ever given. You are given 15 PTO days and 6 separate sick days, but there are stringent guidelines on how PTO can be used and you can only take one full week off per year and can only take 2 long weekends (because you have to work Saturdays in banking). It is absolutely unbearable, and I would NEVER work here again.","ATM TECHNICIAN","Former Employee","Plainfield, IN","October 26, 2018","1.0"

"Was much much  better when it was Midland Loan Services","I enjoyed working for Midland Loan Services.  After PNC took over, it became merely a mundane job.  No longer bonuses for non-salary positions, very few raises, no day after Thanksgiving off, no vending machines on each floor.  Workload basically doubled to the point you were afraid to take a lunch, let alone a vacation or even half a sick day or you would come back to a boat load of emails.

"Terrible for working parents or anyone else really","There are some things that are positive, like the maternity leave. You can literally take off 4 months to have a baby. The problem is after you have that baby, any time you may need is dependent on your manager/department. There are not set rules or policies as far as how to take OA time, leaving early,vacation days, etc. So, if you have to leave an hour early to take that new baby to the doctor, you better dam well have OA time or you are S.O.L. And don't even think about having a disabled child, because when those last minute things pop up, as they absolutely will, you either need to take OT time or FMLA that you won't get paid for. Even if your department has over time on a weekly basis, there is no making up unless it's ""scheduled"". Unless that is your are one of the special employees whose rules don't pertain to you; then you're ok. Also, they won't train you for you're position and if you make a mistake, they then want to write you up and threaten your job. You can ask just about any employee at PNC and they will tell you the training is deplorable. Throughout the entire company. Plus, don't think you'll be able to move around based on the merit of your work, work ethic, performance because it's all about who you know. If you don't know someone in a department, you more than likely won't even get a shot, especially if it's a supervisor position. They have to interview people for legal reasons, but what you don't know is they already have someone in mind for that position, so they are just wasting your time.

"Relaxed and collaborative workplace with gracious managers","This position was a relaxed, entry-level title. Management was made up of a collection of managers that oversaw their own team. My manager and my team were all very nice people that cared about work-life balance. PNC offered up to 3 weeks paid vacation, in addition to 6 occasional absences and one personal day that you could take throughout the year. The pay started at 12 an hour when I first came in, but changed to 15 an hour as PNC upped their minimum wage. Overall, I saw that employees and managers were all very happy and content with what PNC had to offer. However, living in Pittsburgh is very stressful and expensive, so it's not for everyone. I would recommend PNC to anyone that likes a quiet, independent work environment. Don't expect to get out of your chair very much while working this position. The only big downside that I saw is that you have to really work hard in order to ever progress. Managers dont want you to move up.

"Great Place to Work, Very Corporate","PNC has excellent benefit options, a lot of resources to learn from and to ask questions to. They have a pension plan and 401K (with a % match) and they had just bumped Minimum wage when I was leaving. 
 A typical day in Document Imaging was busy but enjoyable, the team I worked with was full of nice and delightful people. The experience would probably change widely with different managers, of which there are many, but I like all of the managers that I met and worked with. 
 The only Negative was how corporate the company could be. Timed task reconciliation (you timed yourself and you had to calculate your production at the end of EVERY DAY) was stressful and could leave you feeling like you under-preformed on a day that you worked your butt off. Often in daily morning production reviews the sub-par numbers would be the only thing noticed, not the workload or the numbers in the green.

At the risk of sounding sour, It was a great place to work unless you had to communicate with the boss.  There were RARELY EVER positive conversations.  Just putting out fires or helping them of a jam because they didn't want to take the time to do their job.  The culture was good except for the management...  Best part of the day was leaving.  The manager also choose to ignore the enormous leadership development initiative set forth by our company leader.  ""Strange"" to say the least.

I left PNC on September 19th and they had entered August 20th. As of Tuesday October 10th I was supposed to have everything corrected and have my paper work overnighted didn't receive it until October 12th after calling and asking where it was.

"Pnc bank","The hardest thing about working in a branch is that every branch entirely depends on its manager. If the manager is out of sorts, the entire branch will be as well. I have worked in several branches with both good, attentive managers and also extremely poor, callas managers. Every workplace will have its issues, and professionalism should always come first. You should never see your manager and teller lead arguing over how to do lunches and yelling in front of customers threatening to quit the job. I have seen fantastic, helpful managers make sure that every employee knows how to do their job and willingly answer any question they have. I have seen managers treat employees like they're stupid for asking a question. The job culture and what PNC represents is a wonderful product and theme. They truly do want to do good by the customer and expect their employees to always do the right thing. As long as you've done your research into a branch, you can have an amazing work experience and enjoy coming to work everyday to see your friends/co-workers.","TELLER","Former Employee","Waynesburg, PA","October 1, 2018","4.0"

Health benefits were much better in the past, however still glad to have the benefits. Overall its a decent workplace. There are several lines of business in banking and it takes time to find the right position to feel comfortable in and excel in with the right leadership and management backing you. This is my opinion and experience only.","Lockbox Shift Lead","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 29, 2018","3.0"
"Going Nowhere Fast","I was excited about PNC when I 1st came, but quickly found out that PNC was a revolving door going to nowhere. The Comp plan sucks, the System sucks, and the chance to truly get paid on your hard work sucks. I'm sorry, if I'm selling refinances for $500,000 or better I should get more than $500. It take forever for Loans to fund too. The underwriters are lazy, the management is spread too thin, and the moral is worse than the set of Michael Jacksons Thriller. Heck at least the Zombies get to dance. The trainers don't even know the answer to vital questions and do not truly prepare employees to be successful after they leave training. MLO's made less than the Mail Clerks! Slap in the face and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time. When I started it was 105 MLO's on the floor and when I left it was only 35. Don't waste your time, you'll just be looking for another place to work and that's sad because they're suppose to be a top 10 Bank. It's like getting all dressed up with no place to go! Last thing, It's not fun seeing people scared that they are going to lose their jobs. I wish some of these CEO's could spend time with their employees and see why you need to treat your front line better.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","September 28, 2018","2.0"

There is some teaching but often the individual is left to figure out issues on their own. The department had a lot of procedures in place but sometimes it was hard to follow and there was some inconsistencies among different senior employees so it made it harder to know what to do in certain instances.  Still, there were trainings and meetings to aid and address the the errors.","Commercial Loan Payoff Analyst I","Current Employee","Overland Park, KS","September 13, 2018","3.0"
"Best Employer","PNC was probably the best employer I worked for.  I worked in the Leadership College of the newly formed Corporate University.  I was afforded the opportunity to assist other PNC lines of business with employee development activities and there were always new challenges.
 I would never have left the company if it wasn't 911 and how the world changed that day.  I have a very good Supervisor and the team I worked with was very professional.","Training Project Manager and Corporate Officer","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 12, 2018","5.0"
"My time with pnc was okay","My time with pnc was okay. The environment was very stressful and the employees were not happy in their positions which affected the moral.

"summary","PNC is a great place to work.  There are definitely heavy volume times, but the team always finds a way to get the work done.  I do feel as volumes increase that PNC should take a better look at staffing appropriately to handle the increases in volume and additional products being launched that also bring in additional volume to the Line of Business.","Operations Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 11, 2018","4.0"
"Not a fun place to work","Overall the views and what the company stands for is great, however I never experienced them treating their own employees with a high level of respect, I say some even disrespect others.","BANKING CONSULTANT","Current Employee","Ohio","September 11, 2018","3.0"

"PNC Mortgage - Not a fit for me","PNC as a company has great benefits; Health, dental, vision, HSA, 401k, vacation time and sick pay. The mortgage industry can be very stressful. After an annual review, the raise was very minimal and less than 2% when meeting all expectations. Management lacks communication, micromanaging has significantly increased. The required ""minimum"" for the daily job is highly unobtainable. The amount of knowledge that is expected to perform the daily job, in addition to the stress of the nature of the position, blinded management, and the lack of compensation I feel is incredibly unfair. Morale is very low, I will admit, each person is accountable to uplift themselves and others, but PNC puts full responsibility of this on their employees, There are no, to maybe very tiny attempts from a ""corporation"" to value their employees.","Customer Support Representative","Current Employee","Miamisburg, OH","September 10, 2018","3.0"
"poor work vs life balance","I was told when I took this position that I would be required to work every other Saturday.  I was scheduled to work every Saturday for the duration of my employment.

"Low pay for the level of responsibility","Low pay for the level of responsibility.  You were second in charge after the branch manager, shouldn't the pay reflect that?  Branch Manager made the workplace very toxic.","Branch Sales and Service Associate III","Former Employee","Rockingham, NC","September 10, 2018","3.0"
"Unfinished","I worked in the corporate office downtown and as never able to get to the real point of me being hired. I had editing their level four policy with a mentor but wasn't able to interview managers to figure out procedures, write those procedures, and then create a document that would be used to train people. The powers that be saw that a red flag from an audit had been fixed and decided to let all the temp employees go. That shouldn't have included me because the others were data entry, and yet I was let go, as well. We were placed in an old server room in the very center of the floor, so it was closed off and freezing. We were given leave to do whatever we wanted throughout the day as long as we got the immediate responsibilities done. I didn't feel like a proper employee of the place because of being both isolated and almost alienated.","Documentation Specialist","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 10, 2018","2.0"
"Summary","A very nice group of professionals.
It was not what I expected after being hired.

"It's a numbers game.","PNC will teach you about the 'conversation' but in reality it is a waste of time with constant double entry of information and debriefs that might as well not use a computer. The incentives are a joke and upper management pretend to say we aren't Wells Fargo. However, the constant nick-picking and lobby engagement doesn't allow us to do our job properly. For a conservative bank, they act surprised when 70% of the credit card apps get declined and you punish your loyal clients and reward the ones that don't manage their funds properly. You don't get paid all that well and the retention is horrible. This is why PNC offers 'bonuses' to try to keep you to stay on for just one more year as they suck your will to survive.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Maryland","September 9, 2018","1.0"
"Marketing & tools lacking","products don't meet all client segmentations and are not competitive in the market place. client website offers a good tools for clients but like many firms it is a widget environment.","Private Client Relationship Banker","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 8, 2018","3.0"
"Customer Service has very little flexibility","You are clocked with everything you do on the computer. Every second you're not ""auto in"" they subtract that from your schedule adherence. Realistically you have about 30 minutes to be out of adherence. They really stress being in adherence. Although you cant just end a call when you want so one long complicated call could easily put you out of adherence. You have two 15 minute breaks, but again a call can easily go all the way through that break. You then have to decide whether to take that break and risk not being in adherence for the day. So you could realistically be taking calls for 4 hours straight if you have a call that takes up your whole break. Got to go to the bathroom, thats going to be counted against your schedule adherence if you cant hold it until your lunch or regular break. 
Hardest part of the job is having talks with customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance, and they are only calling in because they don't understand why they have over a hundred dollars in Overdraft fees. We are supposed to educated them on how to prevent that from happening, and offer solutions for the future, but most of these people just want to argue and want the non-refundable fees refunded. 
Best part, there is an employee appreciation week with games, food , and you get to interact with the upper management. Also, there are some really nice people and sweet old ladies that call in, but thats not the majority of the calls unfortunately. 
Overall, its a great way to get your foot in the door to a great company, and can really help you get experience for your resume - more...","Call Center","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 8, 2018","4.0"
"What I Learned","I learned I am not a salesperson. This is a very competitive sales role and PNC expects you to wring referrals and account/investment openings from nowhere. Sell, sell, sell. Well I am more for protecting my customers' well-being so I tried to give them good advice, not upsell them at every turn. Therefore I could not get transferred/promoted and got the minimal raise at the start of the year.","CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE II","Former Employee","Louisville, KY","September 7, 2018","3.0"
"""Okay"" Position","If you want good work/life balance do not work in a PNC in-store setting. You will work weekends and holidays.

"Regional Leadership/ Work Culture","PNC has the potential to be a great place work. However, in the past 2 years there's been an extreme lack of leadership resulting in a very high level of turnover. I mastered many skills, and enjoyed the opportunity to grow client relationships, but the focus changed in to a more micro managed, sales oriented environment, where the branch manager's had little lead way to make judgment decisions in the best interest of the team, or clients. The Region's Leaders don't care about the branch employee's. There were many days they would enter the branch, and not speak to the staff. That in itself makes one feel unappreciated, and devalued. A main reason for the increase, and loss of many valued, tenor employees due to the ability to break down the regions morale. The benefits are okay along with the chance to earn incentive bonus. Communication which is one of the company's core values was almost nonexistent. Sometime new hires aren't given a fair chance at proper training, and advancement depends on who you are, Overall PNC is a good company when led by consistent, strong, management. Loyal employees create loyal client relationships.","Customer Service Representative","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","September 6, 2018","3.0"
"Great place to work.","Pnc is an awesome place to work especially for someone fresh out of high school. They pay well for a first time job and in general for that matter. There is plenty of room for advancement and every manager I've had has pushed me to advance.

"Great work envoirnment","One of the best jobs I had ever had. This company gives you everything you could ask for. Benefits, Work/Life, Competitive compensation. The biggest issue they have is with MANAGEMENT. One bad manager can taint an entire experience, and that tends to happen quite often in PNC, as Managers are often quickly replaced and/or rotated. Consistent management is key to running a good business, and PNC fails to find good managers.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Detroit, MI","September 4, 2018","5.0"

"Salary","Two major issues with PNC Bank are; low salary and lack of career advancement. If you live in Pittsburgh, PA where the headquarters is located you have a better chance of advancing your career. However, if you are located in Philadelphia then the company is only an experience mill to help you gain experience for other financial companies. Even if you have a bachelors degree and try to advance from an Analyst I to an Associate I or II your application will be denied, mainly due to the company mainly wanting to hire from the outside and keep salaries low.
 Personally I like my current job, but my talents are being wasted and management are only interested in making themselves look good.
 So if you are a newly graduated undergrad this company is a good start to get your foot into the financial door and nothing more.","Implementation Associate I","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","September 3, 2018","3.0"

"Competetive if you are willing to put the work in","As with all Organizations there is pros and cons. As long as you are dedicated and have the desire to be a Top Performer, the Company is pretty fair in recognizing and awarding your hard work. 
 As with most Branch Manager positions you are responsible for anything and everything. The Company can be more mindful in providing faster and modern technologies to help balance all the spinning plates.
  FTE and Staffing allocations are slim which can be a challenge in meeting your Customer Service, Production and Coaching/Development of your Team. Also, the Branch Manger is the primarily the Business Banker as well so getting out and prospecting to execute on Business Calls can be tricky if you are not fully staffed and have the right Team in place.","Vice President","Current Employee","Orlando, FL","August 31, 2018","4.0"

"Good place to work","PNC really lives the work/life balance culture.

Compensation process is flawed.","None","None","IT (Former Employee)","Pittsburgh, PA","3.0"

I've been called out my name, cursed out, etc yet every time I was the one who got written up. The manager was never available to help us nor did she ever stick up for her employees. I just had to accept that no one cares about me as an individual. I'm just another employee that is replaceable.  After my new manager came in the job was no longer enjoyable.

"Customer Service","PNC is a great bank as a customer.  They offer all the things retail banking customers are looking for.  As an employee, they were great to work for except for compensation.  We once had a meeting where the Regional VP was talking about different levels of accounts.  He said ""who doesn't have at least $2,000 direct deposits per month in their checking account"" (helps avoid monthly fees) and everyone in the training meeting raised their hand was like ""I don't even come close to $2,000/month in direct deposits"".  Showed how out of touch management was from their customer facing employees.  I believe PNC recently increased their minimum wage, but when I was there, it was below $10/hr.  They offer tons of incentives for referrals, but you were lucky to get one or two per day due to the emergence of online banking and most people making the switch from traditional means.  Overall great company.  Just don't work here if you are the only source of income in your family (more of a supplemental income position or for mom's re-entering the workforce).","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Jarrettsville, MD","August 28, 2018","3.0"

"Hard work low pay","They have made it so one position covers them all. One employee is responsible for all branch jobs. Being a teller, being a loan officer, being a customer service representative, being a notary, etc. There were very few days that I got more than a half hour lunch, would work at least 3 weekends a month but it was very offten over a month before I would get a weekend off. They rely heavily on gallop surveys for performance reviews. Where you may get one review a month but have hundreds or thousands of interactions the one review determines everything. So if it was your one ""off"" interaction a month that's all that matters. The pay was not worth the job at all.","Branch sales and service associate","Former Employee","Marysville, OH","August 21, 2018","3.0"

"Work/Life Balance","The company is great if you're interested in getting your foot through the door for banking; however, the commission is only if you get a certain threshold of accounts. The in-store branches have almost no life/work balance and have made the goals more difficult for the branch. My senior staff members have been with the company around 2 years and they make around the same salary as I do when I've been there roughly 8 months. It's a great learning experience as well as a good place to start if you're interested in banking.","BSSA","Current Employee","Gainesville","August 20, 2018","4.0"

"Horrible culture","While working for PNC, we were expected to be independent and not need our managers; then when we had an issue with a client, we were taken to task for not getting the managers involved.
 Prior to the integration between National City Bank and PNC financial services group, the bank was a fantastic place to be. Very collaborative, and the managers were very supportive. 
 At the beginning, it was similar with PNC. Then they decided to do away with our division, hired in a manager whose job it was to get rid of us. She made life and work difficult at best in what I believe was an effort to get those of us she didn't like to quit on our own. She clearly played favorites, and she made coming to work a stressful event. 
 Then they called us into a conference call and said those of us on that call no longer had jobs; literally we IMed with each other saying, ""whoa, wait, did we just get fired??"" 
 Later we discovered if we wanted our full severance, we had to train our replacements from the outsourcing place. We had to finish our work plus take on more projects. It was pure slave labor to get us to leave without our severance. 
 I hope no one ever has to work for the two in charge again.","Training and Design Specialist","Former Employee","Columbus, OH","August 19, 2018","1.0"

"Good place to work if you don't work for in-store","VERY, very heavy sales focus to the point that the customer's wellbeing is placed behind the company's production quotas. 
 If you work for the in-store, you have NO work/life balance as your hours Monday-Friday are 10:30AM-7:45PM, Saturday 10:30AM-6:45PM, and Sunday 10:30AM-3PM and you are only guaranteed off 3 holidays every year - New Year's Day, Christmas Day, and Thanksgiving Day. 
 The quality of people that PNC hires for their in-store is low so customer retention is non-existent (unless they bribe you with yearly stay-on bonuses). They often hire people who are unequipped to handle banking and end up leaving due to stress. 
 If you are good at your job, they try to pigeon-hole you into staying in the in-store realm forever even if you were promised in-store as a stepping stone to moving on to traditional or universal banking.
 They will cheat you out of a promotion even if you were only 1,000 revenue credits short of goal and your colleagues aren't even hitting their minimum set goals... but they still get paid similarly to you when the PNC pay scale is already below average. They tell you to just keep busting your butt to make commission at the expense of giving you a better yearly salary.
 Management often sucks. They'll look the blind eye to unethical practices as long as they meet sales goals. The stress should never be that high. In-store managers have no real power and therefore employees can manipulate managers easily as it's nearly impossible to fire someone even if they no call/no show.
 If you don't make your quota, it's like the whole world fell - more...","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Gainesville, VA","August 17, 2018","3.0"

 PNC has incredible work-life balance.  I rarely work an hour over 40 hours per week, and work-from-home was pretty flexible.  Vacation policies are reasonable.
 However, PNC develops software as if it is 1990.  Do not go work for PNC if you want to work on anything cutting-edge.  Attempts to advise management and change the IT culture are ineffective -- no amount of APIFests is going to fix the fundamental problems with IT dinosaurs making enterprise-level decisions.

"Beware!","DON'T DO IT!!!
 The main reason I took this job was because it was a work from home position. But it's AWFUL! Their turnover rate is ridiculously high & I see why!
 The training is so poor it's not even funny. You're basically in a room with a 'trainer' who sits on her phone all day. You just do web based learning & tutorials to cover PNC in the case that you completely screw up an account. That way they can say well you as the employee were given the correct tools to avoid this from happening. 
 The pay is TERRIBLE! They give you a 10% differential during training & once you go home it's a 12%...which believe me isn't worth the stress the job brings on. 
 You have to endure being tethered to a phone all day like a dog on a leash taking back to back to back calls, expect to take at least 70 calls a day. The calls come in so quick you can't even take a sip of water! You have to deal with people wanting to check their balance, wonder where their checks are, yell at you because they overdrafted their account & there's nothing you can do to help them. There's no particular way on how to handle a call, it's all up to your discretion which I think is terrible. 
 A customer can get three different answers from three different people. There's not even consistency with the training, it's all based on what mentor you work with & how you will be told to perform your job. One consistency is don't hang up on customers or use foul language, other than that- figure it out!
 Their point of reference once you go home is to utilize the intranet or reach out to peer support via a telephone - more...","Support Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 28, 2018","2.0"

After many process changes I managed and supported my team during challenging times without missing a beat or missing any SLA's. I coached and supported my team during time off and was always a working manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I problem solved for internal and external customers to came to a happy resolution. The hard part was coaching team members to give more than their job requires to help them see how important they were to our team and how much a difference they made in the company.

"Its not for everyone","The call center, customer service industry is rapidly growing and pays well. The hours are very fixed, but there is always opportunity for OT hours. The hardest part of the job is not taking things personal, high stress, and fast paced. If you're a slow learner, this isn't for you. There isn't much room for upward mobility. The incentives that are given for meeting metrics, in my opinion make the work place culture disingenuous. Most likely, you'll be working from home. Most of the on-site call centers are closing.

 The worst is the customer service scores.  Customers are called anonymously by Gallup, and if the scores are not nearly perfect, then the branch doesn't get their incentive payout.
 And furthermore, the employee that received the lower score is placed on an ""action plan"".

"Pnc bank","The work environment was always great and the people I worked with were easy to get along with. I traveled from branch to branch on a daily basis. It was difficult to adjust to each branches different set of rules. 
Management was unable to give definite answers, always felt like they were beating around the bush. At times it felt as though management was not there to support and develop you. 
The scheduling was pretty inconsistent, working Monday-Saturday and only having  an hour trimmed here and there. Instead of a half day which most would expect and some got. But they insist on keeping you under 40 hours, and if you did by chance get overtime there were always questions about it.
Training became too much at times. You'd finish one set of training and be assigned more to do. Sometimes you were required to travel for training.  
The incentive was quarterly, and sometimes felt like you weren't given enough opportunity to achieve it.

"It's alright","Management differs heavily between branches. There are a handful of managers who are willing to work with individuals to seek advancement. Most however, either dislike interviewing or are too comfortable with their over inflated bonuses to be willing to risk helping you get promoted and in the process loosing some of that incentive with the new hire. The claim they pride themselves on promoting from within but as with most banks you will quickly find that they outside hire often. The only normal internal promotions are within branches when there is again zero risk to the branch manager and their bonus.
 Employee culture is excellent, work life balance is very good and the compensation is fair. The retirement benefits are the most generous portion of the package. That being said until the internal talent development culture sees a massive shift PNC is at best a great stepping stone on the way to where you want to be. That is unless you are an outside hire.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Indianapolis, IN","July 11, 2018","3.0"

I've had days where clients made me furious and used their entitlement to look down on what I did there. But there were a lot of great times too. There are some clients who make what you do worth while. However, considering all that is required to do the job safely the pay isn't worth it. Especially if you are working as a teller.

The turnover rate for new employees in that Segment is 100% annually.
So the branches don't setup appointments with their clients because they know you will not be there long.
 That would have been good to know","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","St. Louis, MO","July 2, 2018","1.0"

"BSSA/Manager","The company overall has many opportunities for community involvement if presented to you by upper management. I worked there through many changes throughout the company. As the company shifted so did the management. The work environments were stressful. The days were long and the staffing was short. If you didn't email the proper chain and save those emails to back up what you needed help with or to keep abreast on the expectations no one stood up if there was a fire within the branch. Loss prevention should be more hands on in training staff properly. After the Wells Fargo scandal we were told to back off selling. Once the heat died down the pressure was on. You felt like your job was on the line every day. Rather being meeting sales goals or being an octopus by doing your job and everyone else's. There's no team work or comradery in this organization.

"Moderate Risk Financial Institution Traditionally Known to Value Its Employees","Good ""community bank"" feel with stability of a large institution.  Does the right things for customers and most of the time for its employees as well.  Mid-management lacks leadership and mentorship skills, mostly are top operators that needed an avenue for higher pay.  Improved management training needed.  Overall a good and stable company for high performers and low performers alike.  Not an ""up or out"" company, if you are a low performer, just stick to your lane and you'll have a happy and long career.  Top performers are well rewarded but need to remain nimble to align self with the most current and relevant leaders to survive.  Very lax work environment.  Friendly workforce that is very tolerant.

Acceptable benefits structures.","Strategy Planning Business Analysis Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","June 26, 2018","4.0"

Remberced for any travel expenses and mileage used for work and training. They provide lots of trainings as well. Be ware, SO MANY GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS. Be prepared to be HOUNDED if you are even A LITTLE behind on goal. If a client doesn't not want a sale, YOU WILL get the backlash because mangement assumes you are not selling it right. They also promote life and family but if you are full time you can work a 6 day week! 30 minute lunches (not long enough) You have to use paid time to be off, you can't just take off and it makes work life balance hard.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Maryland","June 25, 2018","3.0"
"not a good bank for customer or employee","Worked in a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door. On top of that, PNC does everything in it's power to keep customers out of the branch because it's cheapest checking account requires customers to do all their business through the ATM or they will receive a monthly fee. PNC does not do right by their tellers; they do most of the work in the branch, assume all the liability (any bad check will cost you your job), and are expected to reach unrealistic sales goals on a skeleton staff. Go into a PNC bank, it will be empty but for one or two tellers max and their drive thru lines will most likely be shut down as well.
 Also I've never seen a company more intent on cramming social justice warrior nonsense down the throats of their employees on a weekly basis as PNC. They will bombard you with emails and on the internal webpage pushing this agenda and are quick to fire any employee who even slightly objects to their ""shared vision"" on these issues.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Wilmington, NC","June 25, 2018","1.0"

You get to work with a wide array of people across locations - which is both challenging and interesting.  There is talk about ""challenging the status quo"" but should you levy a challenge it is often not well received.  There is frequent change of leadership with in the teams - which is disruptive and prevents continuity. They do have a liberal internal job posting practice, but moving with in can be challenging.  Despite qualifications for open positions. hiring is based more on who you know than what you know - which is extremely discouraging.  I feel there is not a gender pay gap at this company.  The pay grades and comp structure is based on the job - not who fulfills it.  Which is a plus!   The typical work day is filled with conference calls.  Some of which are helpful, others that are not a good use of ones time.  Health benefits are not great.  Plans have a high deductible and out of pocket expenses.  They are generous with vacation time, etc.  After you meet a required time of service you can even purchase another weeks vacation.  Most managers are accommodation with Dr's appts etc.  For those considering working here, i would ask questions during the interview process and make sure you are comfortable before you accept any offers.

"Do not fall for their promises","Micromanagement at its best. All about sales and numbers at the end of the day, despite what they tell you. If you are a seasoned banker, stay away from them. PNC wants inexperienced people so they can mold them into what they think a banker should be. They do not value experience. Pay is woefully short compared to their competitors.  They think their process is the end all to be all. If there is a problem, they believe the people are the problem and not their process.

"Flexible work environment, but there are trade-offs","There are pluses and minuses to working at PNC.  Positives - flex schedule and work from home, Negative - heavy outsourcing with sub-par quality workers, heavy process, and slow to implement.
 If you work here, expect heavy process and strict procedures, many constraints to performing your job, mass approvals needed for just about everything, and an ""over-the-top"" amount of required documentation.  The approval process is so heavy that it loses the intent, i.e., approvers select ""approved"" without reviewing.  The company tries to cut costs by outsourcing to OffShore and OnShore (non-US citizen)  resources, but quality suffers.  Cultural differences are apparent in quality of work, work ethic, and efficiency.  Projects take an unreasonable amount of time to complete, and end up being costly.  I wish upper management would understand that they are losing quality employees to less qualified, and less dedicated employees.  The non-US contracted resources are initially less expensive, but end up costing the company and shareholders much more.
 On the up-side, the company tries to institute a work-life balance during the holidays, and avoids scheduling production deployments during these times.  The work from home option is wonderful.  It saves on commute time, and provides a quieter environment to work.","Technology Project Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","April 28, 2018","4.0"

 If you live outside of the major hubs: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Charlotte, Kalamazoo then there isn't much opportunity for advancement.

"Slow-paced & great benefits, yet stressful place to work","Policies and Procedures are impossible to fully comprehend as they are taught as you go with the try and fail approach. Training is mediocre and once again, as you go, however, the manager won't have the time to be the one to train you. Turnover is fairly high. Upper management will be in your branch all of the time if you are not hitting the numbers they want. Pay is decent compared to other banks. Benefits included are healthcare, including dental and vision if desired, 3 weeks of vacation (1 of which must be used all together), 6 sick days, 1 Personal day, 401k, pension plan, decent maternity leave. Typically may work 1-2 Saturdays per quarter. Work day is 8:30am-5:30pm with 1 hour lunch.

"The First Job I Ever Really Loved","I had always heard that if you loved your job, work was easy to handle and coming into work in the morning felt invigorating. I never really believed that until I went to my small rural PNC branch, where everyone treated me like family. I was worked hard, but rewarded for my work and treated well. The benefits are great as well. When I worked there, the pay was significantly less than other banks, but I hear that is currently being changed.
I loved PNC, and in a year and a half I moved from part time teller, to full time, and eventually Teller Supervisor. I ended up leaving because we received a new branch manager who was very antagonistic and incompetent. Corporate was very unreceptive and dismissive, and after enough abuse I left. However, after working at multiple branches, I still feel like as a whole, PNC is a good environment and company, especially for someone looking to get into banking or office work.","Acting Supervisor","Former Employee","Sykesville, MD 21784","March 11, 2018","4.0"

It can definitely be a high stress job due to the many things that you must look out for and the people you encounter. However, the pace, stress level, and atmosphere of the branch depends on the location. I've worked at a branch where they see a hand full of customers for the entire 8 hours and I've worked in a branch, such as mine, that can be very busy and almost everyone has a problem. You are expected to provide a very high level of service to customers and you must show up at 110% to work everyday.

I have had 3 different team leads (supervisor) within 2 months time. People cannot keep the job, and the culture at PNC is toxic. Everyone is really stressed out, team leaders are incredibly demanding and sporadic. You will deal with a lot of difficult and angry customers. About 20% of your call load are customers that are willing to yell to get what they want, and you cannot help them as much as other banks. PNC has a lot of restrictions and policies, hardly any leniency in the call center position. Pay is decent, however advancement is very limited for the amount of employees they have. You have to be a superstar to go anywhere. Pack a lunch, because there lunch bars are incredibly expensive and close 2 hours into your shift if you work 2nd shift.","Customer Service Representative","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI 49009","March 7, 2018","2.0"
"productive and fun work place","A typical day at PNCBank was usually busy but fun at the same time.  I enjoyed my co workers, management and the customers.

One on one coaching around how to recognize an opportunity for a bank client to meet with me for a consultation.  Management was very hands on and supportive and wanted the advisors to be successful.  The hardest part of the job was to keep my bank partners focused and motivated.  Once I received a qualified referral, I truly enjoyed understanding and learning about the client's financial circumstances and needs.  I looked forward to educating  clients about different investment products and why what I proposed made the most sense based on their individual financial position..","Financial Advisor","Current Employee","Montvale, NJ","March 6, 2018","3.0"

"Training is a self study nightmare","Peers are friendly, management is open to conversations with employees. I started at PNC and the training program is ineffective. Four different facilitators in four weeks, no consistency in work materials and ""the new training system is coming"" which doesn't benefit those in a broken training environment. 
 There is very little practical training on how to use systems and process banking requests. 
 Overall it would be just an average 3/5 because they do offer competitive salaries and some pretty decent benefits, but the frustration at dealing with poor training cannot be ignored. There are some questionable wage and hour practices as well, requiring employees to be present and logged in and ""caught up"" on system process and procedures while not on paid time.","Service Consultant","Current Employee","Columbus OH","March 6, 2018","3.0"

My department was split up and I was one of the unfortunate ones to get a green horn manager.

My biggest dislike of the job was how much pressure is put on the employees, even the tellers, to push products and services on the clients.

Unfortunately that manager was rude, unethical and quite literally verbally abusive to their staff.

"great place to work for steady low pay","I worked for PNC lockbox as an operations specialist for nearly ten years.  I enjoyed my job overall, and was happy with my work.  The issues that I encountered were the increasing amount of work without any increased pay also my manager hovered and watched every move that I made along with others. I get that, that was a part of his job, but most adults do not like to be micro managed.  For example, my bathroom time down to the seconds was clocked. It is a high paced production environment, but certain things like relieving your bladder should not be managed.  Also so much negative emphasis would be placed on one error rather than the 1000+ correct things you've already entered.  I learned a lot and I respect that job for my growth; with that being said, I am so glad that I left.  My pay has increased, I am no longer being micromanaged, and I meet all of my deadlines on time with no issues.  Also If I happen to make a mistake, my supervisor talks to me with respect to remedy any concerns. I no longer feel like my livelihood is threatened with each error.","Senior Operations Specialist","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","February 6, 2018","3.0"

I found this very disappointing.  I found the micro management of statistics to be very  emotionally exhausting even though I had five years of customer service experience before working at this job.

"Be a big producer or go somewhere else","Being a brand new Mortgage Loan officer I didn't realize it would take 1.5 year to 2 or more years to create the relationships that would lead to getting enough loans to pay the bills.  1.5 years in and you learn from mistakes, that you should have someone mentoring you through. To be successful here you need to established with outside relationships. Need to bring in over a million a month on your own to make a regular 60K salary. The pay out is based on tiering schedule, so less than that really doesn't help pay your bills. The base pay is non-forgivable, which means you pay it back. So you have to make sure you are closing every month enough to cover the base pay and enough to make a living for yourself.  If you have a month without closings, they pay your base salary, but next month they will take it out of your pay.  If you make 2000 and owe 500 because of a deficit you get paid 1500.00. You don't need a state license, but if you are licensed you can get better pay working for a banker or broker. Much higher pay.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","New York State","February 3, 2018","3.0"

Micro-managing was a constant issue with my group and leadership was a nightmare with inconsistencies in decision making and collaboration.","Operations Manager II","Former Employee","Rocky Mount, NC","January 22, 2018","2.0"

"Summary","I had such high hopes when I started working for PNC. I was told that PNC really cared about their employees and understood that employees had a life outside of work. I always tried to go above and beyond for the company. I was a part-time teller and was working full-time hours for a month because a teller had left. I went out of my way to come in whenever they needed me to. Finally I asked a month in advance for a day I needed off and of course they did not give it to me. Even if you are part-time according to PNC they have to be your main priority. I tried to reapply and give them another shot, but they told me I wasn't a match because I told them the reason why I left PNC is because I needed to attend a really IMPORTANT family event and was told there is no flexibility in PNC. I'm glad I was told that because I don't want to go back to a bank who pretends to care, but only care about themselves. My advice to any part-time tellers is that it's okay to go above and beyond sometimes, but don't do it all the time if your going to be frustrated if they won't return the favor. Other than that I really enjoyed this job. I do still reccomend to people to work here if they have no problem making this job your top priority from friends and family.","Teller","Former Employee","Indiana","January 18, 2018","3.0"

"Strong Brand in Financial Services Industry","PNC is a strong financial company with basically fair benefit and compensation packages.

 Company strengths are solid/sustained strong financial status and competitive suite of products that are well supported with marketing research/collateral, tech support, and subject matter product experts.
 An enjoyable element of working at PNC is representing a strong and formidable brand in the financial services business.  This company has a well thought out ""go to market"" strategy and has developed industry vertical specialization primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, professional services and retail.

"Learning Lession","I've learned much about banking operations and have enjoyed making friends of several co-workers.  I've enjoyed working with clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis.  I've learned about their lives and helped make a difference in their financial well-being.
 The experience has reinforced my belief that organization and time management are an essential part of any business operations.  Chaos in a busy environment starts from not being organized, ready to work when the day begins, and keeping track of what must be accomplished by day end.  I have also learned more about what management styles I work with best.  I enjoy working with individuals whom I respect and trust. I believe in treating people the way that you would be treated and being consistent with adhering to policies & procedures.

Scores for customer surveys were taken very seriously, even on the occasion that it was clear that they representative was calm, attentive, and helpful to the best of their abilities, but the customer was still dissatisfied that their requests were not completed the way they wanted and a low score was given.","Credit Card Services Senior Consultant","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 1, 2018","2.0"
"Fast paced, very stressful","Current management very good.  Past management-very much micro managed.  Culture is very competitive-pitting co-workers against each other.  Even though we as workers try to work as a team - in order to reach goals there are many times you must work as cut throat.  This makes for very stressful environment.  Once you've worked here for a length of time and reach the middle of the pay band scale it is very difficult to receive decent raises- 2% is considered a good raise.  The longer I work here the further I fall behind in just covering the cost of living.","Consumer Loan Fulfillment","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 1, 2018","3.0"

"It's an OK place to work","I'm very neutral about PNC as a place to work. As with all companies it depends on the area you work in. The call center often gives the wrong information when you call to seek advice which often is at odds with advice from management. Information does not always filter down to you so you find out the hard way, that you made a mistake and are held accountable. Senior management are too busy sitting in their ivory towers, making decisions which impact branch staff, without consulting the staff. They also have no idea about what is going on at branch level as they rarely, if at all, visit the branches. The job culture is extremely conservative & makes it hard to properly assist customers.","Service Associate","Personal Banker","Columbus, OH","December 30, 2017","3.0"

They're pretty much given free reign and aren't govern or checked, so basically, you're at the mercy of your manager whether you perform well or not.

Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking. My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to that plan. That's the best way to succeed. The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet. The hardest part of  the job is the stress that comes with the territory. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for it among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner.

The turn over rate for pnc is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact). So if you don't mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you're willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than pnc is the place for you.

"Teller responsibilities are achievable, but skewed.","Although there was a 'typical day' expectation, a typical day was rather rare. Pushing sales and dealing with off-loaded phone calls added great stress to the day's rhythm.
 Be sure to keep your personal life absent. Diversity is lauded, until it is demonstrated. PNC prefers robots; and that is what is expected.
 Prepare to be bullied - at great length. Do not share challenges, as they will become obstacles. Smile, be polite, and lie: These are the qualities that PNC prefers.","Teller II","Former Employee","Virginia","November 30, 2017","1.0"

I learned through trial and error. The day moves pretty slow and many tasks aren't that hard but all the inside information, like rules and policies, and branch codes and safety wasn't taught to me and is essential for doing the job.

Worked in a ""Universal branch"", meaning we did the jobs of both tellers and platform bankers, but were not compensated any more for it. Co-workers were great, but the manager did a poor job of preparing me when I first started and you are put into a sink-or-swim environment. Benefits were ok, but the pay was extremely lacking compared to what bankers at other banks receive. Also, deceptive hiring as they do not tell you about the cold sale calls you will be making.

There was always a push for sales, but it was always a need based sale. The incentive system was pretty good, but could definitely be improved, as your largest bonus was at the mercy of every client, which could or could not hurt you. Often, any poor reviews were due to circumstance out of your control. However, though there were bad interactions, all of the positive interactions made your day great.

PNC just recently changed their pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service.

The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny. The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for. The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are. All in all, PNC is a great company to work for.

Your inbox will be cleared the day before and the next day you come in you see 100+ emails with every single branch flaunting about one account here one credit card there.

"PNC is the most underhanded company to work for","Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for it. PNC does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset that over time. PNC lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits them. Management is an absolute joke. If you ever try to leave the company, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, those managers will try everything in their power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if they can help it. I know from personal experience. Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet those goals, PNC won't fire you for not meeting the goals, but they WILL fire you for not doing your ""job"". The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if PNC is not careful, they will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has.

"Rocky start, terribble management","The training process was lengthy and frustrating. You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved them in a timely manner. Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees. There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts. She would come and go for hours as she pleased. We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff. There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue.

"Lack of communication, poor management and no sense of direction.","This place is a sink or swim type of job.  There is NO training that actually teaches anyone how to do their job.  Because everything is so numbers driven, co-workers can't/won't make time to help new people out, and those who do are punished with poor performance ratings. Suggestions for improvement are ignored. Upper management is too busy having meetings about the meetings they have to actually take time to talk to their ""minions"" to find out what is happening in the office and how they can help make the workplace a better environment.  Quarterly financials talk about how much the bank is making, but at year end review they can't afford to give their employees raises.

"Could be better","The company preaches customer service first which is great; Employees were taught to take a care of the customers, and most did, but I feel that the company could have done a better job of taking care of the employees. The pay is very low compared to most retail banking companies so sales associates try to make up for the compensation through commission. However, the company is doing more and more to push customers to bank on their own as opposed to in the branch, which in turn makes it more difficult for employees to hit the sales numbers in order to earn a decent commission.

HR is difficult to reach or deal with. Management is ok, ish. My personal manager is great but at times you can find no one to go to if someone has an issue above your pay grade. Security is good, if you have a trainable team.  Biggest upside is vacation time, however work life balance is difficult otherwise. Typically day begins at 8:00am and many days we stay until at least 6:30pm. Sometimes we get a 30 minute break, a lot of times it's disrupted with a client issue.

"sweat shop, no care for the employee","The company lacked training and had very few managers that knew the products well enough to assist.  They pushed a very heavy work load on their employees.  The goals were very out of reach that very few people reached them.  They kept increasing the hours.  They would have us go in on Saturday too to work more and during the winter they shut of the heat.  It got to the point where they were having their employees push in a code every time they left their desk such as making a copy, faxing, taking a loan to a manager, taking a file to u/w etc.  It was crazy.  They also wanted us to call our customer every day if we had an update or not.  It got to the point our underwriters were to work 10 hours then take their computers home to work and also work the weekends.  They eventually got up in droves and left 20 at a time.  We had no one to underwriter our files and we were still held accountable for closing the loan.

"Great company if you work in the right area","Worked for PNC in 2 different markets. The experience was night and day.
 In one area, there was an excellent support and development network and plenty of opportunity to move into different areas of the bank depending on individual skills and preferences. There was at minimum weekly interaction with specialty team members that handled investments, mortgages, wealth management, etc. to assist in serving the client's needs and identifying clients who would benefit from a targeted conversation with a specialist. It was possible to develop mutually beneficial relationships with the team members assigned to your branch and effectively meet client needs and generate revenue for the bank.
 In the other area, there was little to no support from senior leadership, inexperienced management in the branches, lack of clear communication, and no plans for expansion in a market where branches are over 2 hours from the nearest branch. The lack of branches means that each day becomes an exercise in handling complaints or cashing checks for non-customers with very little opportunity to focus on growing business. Interaction with specialty team members was non-existent. Conversations about investments, mortgages, estate planning, and more are routed through call centers and handled by indifferent team members who never meet the clients and rarely close on business. Clients would often become frustrated because there was no local investment adviser or mortgage representative to meet with and would walk out and take their business elsewhere.

"Not a good place for loan officers","Worked in the Home Lending Center and it ended up being a nightmare. Volume was down significantly, resulting in the majority of LOs not hitting tier targets, thus leading to not making any money. There is likely going to be any change to the compensation plan to accurately reflect how much each loan officer is funding. It is hard to make a decent living off a low salary and very low commission. 
 The leads are now stale, with internal customers being called up several times every other month. Processors on the backend are very inexperienced for the most part, and a lot of underwriters will poorly review files and not know product guidelines for the loan they are underwriting. The loan officers are dependent on them to make any, and it's frustrating when they perform poorly as your pay is somewhat dependent on them. 
 Turn over is extremely high, with a good majority of new hires not lasting one year. They will train you without experience, and being a large company have excellent benefits.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 6, 2017","1.0"

I wanted to get a promotion and was told that I wasn't good enough. My job is stressful because I took on a lot of responsibility and management still didn't care. In order to move up in the company you have to kiss everyone's butt.","Universal Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Florence, KY","August 14, 2017","3.0"
"Normal Bank day","I love working for PNC bank, if it wasn't for the managers themselves I would never want to leave. Although the hours are long (8am to 6pm) I still enjoyed myself while at work. The hardest part is working with the managers who do not care about anyone but themselves. I've made life long friends besides that, and it makes the work day go by quickly.","Teller","Current Employee","pittsburgh","August 14, 2017","3.0"
"Web  set our own goals and it was up to us to achieve them.","We had a fun group to work with.  The building had a cafeteria which was convenient for lunches and snacks.   
 We used our computer to sign in our start time and would log out for breaks, meetings, etc.   The job was not hard, you just had to pay attention to detail when logging in information in the data bases as other departments depend on the information to do their jobs.","Mortgage Loan Clerk","Former Employee","Brecksville, Oh","August 14, 2017","5.0"
"Great Opportunities for Advancement","PNC is a great company to start a career at. The managers will work with you to make sure you are getting into the line of business that you want to work in. They have plenty of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort. Your day varies based on the position you are in. We have branches, call centers, out of branch sales and multiple other lines of business. The culture is very friendly, I have always enjoyed the environment created by my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job is the amount of goals set for someone to accomplish, it can be overwhelming, at the same time extremely motivating. There is always something to work on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created within the workplace and with the customers.","MULTI CHANNEL SALES ASSOCIATE I","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","August 14, 2017","5.0"

"Not bad at all","PNC is a great bank to work for. My position doesn't get paid enough, but for right now, it's good. Was a banker before I went to our operations department.

"Somewhat stressful, high-pressure environment with benefits that can pay off","Any bank is going to be high-pressure. PNC as a corporation does a nice job of providing compensation, benefits, and perks to make up for this. However, I found that the high emphasis on driving sales really affected the work environment, to the point where it was emphasized over customer service - especially when upper management came to visit the branch. The corporate business model really made it hard to focus on what the job was all about - even down to the teller position.","Teller","Former Employee","NJ","August 11, 2017","4.0"
"Hard to go into everyday","They tell you not to be a product pusher but lay a set number of what they call ""expectations"" on you to meet per quarter, which makes you a product pusher if you want to meet them. If you do not meet these ""expectations"" it affects your ability to move up within the company and also raises. Policies and rules constantly change and there is rarely anyone, including managers, who have the right info to give you. There is a survey system that is random and anonymous that asks customers questions based on your interaction, if they even remember it was you, it is very unfair that also determines if you receive pay raises and your ability to advance in the company. I've received bad surveys from customers due to their bad interactions with a different employee all because they survey is anonymous on who the employee was, and it is almost impossible to come back from a bad survey. The maternity leave is awesome, 16 weeks of 100% pay, which honestly is the only reason I stayed with the company for my final months.","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Rockford, IL","August 11, 2017","1.0"

"Absolutely horrible","1 isn't even close to a low enough rating:
 PNC is the worst company I have ever worked for. I had 2 years of banking (at another institution) when I came to PNC & they wouldn't even match the salary I STARTED with at the other institution. Management is a JOKE. They truly have no say in anything that goes on. The goals are attainable, but always changing, making it difficult to be consistent. The expectations are unrealistic, & again, always changing. There is no reward or recognition for ANYTHING. They do not care about their employees or the customer, all they care about are numbers. If you are going into a company looking to advance, this is NOT the place to do it. They require you to be in your current position for a year, they run your credit for any positions you apply for (even promotions within), your goals have to be well beyond what is expected of you, and you have to actually have a manger that cares about your development (DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH).. I could go on forever.. but if you like the shiny perks they hold in front of your face & you're willing to sell your soul, you'll be just fine!
 Side note: don't get too comfortable in your position, they will surely displace you. 400+ jobs this year alone.","Teller","Former Employee","Ohio","August 7, 2017","1.0"

Sound good on paper, but the deductible is $3,000 per year per insured person. They say the hire the best and the brightest but those people either laugh at the low salaries or leave after a year or two. I worked for other local banks, so I can compare.

"Def not a good company to work for","Management don't assist their agents when they need assistance. Management are never around when you need help and lucky if they're at their desk and they will not help you, unless you are their favorite.

"Above Average Company","This has been almost the best job I have ever had. Even if you start out at the ""lowest"" position at PNC, you are given ample opportunity to advance and really make a career for yourself. As a teller, I had the chance to go to monthly meetings and feel important, spoke with my manager on a regular basis on my goals for my career and how I was going to get there, and was just in a great environment with management that showed they actually cared about me. PNC is NOT heavy on sales, they really focus on taking care of the customer and believing in the benefits for them. They don't want to shove a credit card in someone's face that isn't going to benefit from it. Sure, there is incentives and payouts, but customer service truly is number one for this company.

"Started out a great place to work, and now...not so much!","The first 3 1/2 years I spent at PNC, it was like a dream job!
 Then new management rolled in. Throughout the entire company. Then it became a nightmare job! Stupid ridiculous processes that they forced us to use, but the management didn't use them themselves and constantly made us look stupid.
 Then they withheld raises and only gave them to the people they liked, who fell in line with them.

Some departments do not offer bonuses and won't allow you to request time off unless you use your vacation time and that has to be available that day that you need off. No one really cares what you have going on outside of pnc and you can trade shifts with co workers but if your department isn't 24 hours and you can only trade with people on your shift that males trading difficult because more than likely everyone just about works the same shift.

After many unsuccessful attempts, they called me & another lady that had been there for 14 years, into an office and said they were letting us go...but we would get a severance package. The day AFTER I found a new job, I was told by management that they now needed me....and when I said no, I was let go with NO SEVERANCE whatsoever!!!!

"Work with good people","I really enjoy the people I work with and the atmosphere that my peers would create.  My immediate supervisor was good to work with as well.  Maybe not as hands on as what is needed, but assisted in other ways.  The problem is the goals.  There is still what I call a ""Wells Fargonian"" mentality driven by our upper management to push products, hit monthly and quarterly selling goals and not ever talk or concern themselves about the incredible service we provide, but rather how much money did we make the company.","Financial Advisor","Current Employee","Battle Creek, MI","July 13, 2017","3.0"

"PNC is a place of structure and excellence, always looking to propel other's into their future.","One thing I learned is this, I cannot allow the personalities of people to be the set thermometer of the overall vision, but rather realize we are all a gathered people who are set to reach one common goal and that is to increase the value of the company and to change the overall demographics of a culture, where, through the initiative of PNC every person, family, business, etc. is prospering. 
 So as a company, PNC was great!  PNC always made sure, through many on-line quizzes we, the frontline was sharp and knew how to effectively, with intentionality, meet the needs of our customers.

"Great job to move up","PNC is a great place to work. This job has allowed me to learn different aspects of being a bank teller. Most people think being a teller is just counting out money to the customer. You actually do more than what meets the eye.

"Good company but some managers need training","On a typical day, it is business as usual and I learned to be self motivated. I worked under different managers, some very professional and pleasant to work with, others very poor at human relations. Workplace culture is good per company policies, but under a manager who is inexperienced or mischievous, workplace culture is nothing to write home about.

"Disappointing work environment","I always heard great things about working for PNC, but after joining the team I was able to see a different side. I experienced a lack of leadership, the branch experienced a lack of support from upper management. For a 4-5 month period, including over the holidays which are the busiest times of the year, the branch was left with barely a staff. Many times there was only one teller when there needed to be three. The manager cared more about sales versus customer service, and many times would deceive the customer. The upper management was well aware of the problems in the branch and didn't seem to bother to help. As I kept working there I was starting to hear from other people in the company how it was changing and not for the better.

"Loss mitigation","This company could be awesome, but the experience is taken away by manegerial flaws to the 25th power. Any company you work based on culture starts at the top. Pnc loss mitigation department heads have no real relationships with what is going on with staff and barely supervisors. Upper managemt in any way shape or form does not help to streamline a process, but add more and more to a lengthy overdrawn process as well. They believe in a do as i say not as i do sort of management style. They are exempt we are not kind of attitude creating an us against them mentality. This is not good management and it starts from the top. Seldom do you hear any good news from the loss mit dept. They also do layoffs each year
 They tell you there are no layoffs. Then turn right around and do it. They also you personal agenda's to pick who goes. If your looking for safety, happiness, home, and a feeling that you matter this is not the spot.If you looking for drama, constant change, no help, no sympathy, not making it easier for employees to maximize their job.

"Good company...low pay","The environment was great. The people are great.  The only con I have with PNC is the compensation is on the low end for finance.  
 There are bonus opportunities, but until you hit the upper levels of management the compensation is lacking.  
 You do work in a 9-5 environment and that is a big plus. The part of this role that was the most irritating was the outbound calling of your customers. Having to dial 15 customers per day to ""invite"" (solicit) them to come in for a financial checkup was never fun.

"N/a","Overall, PNC is a fantastic company to work for.  They are very development focused, have great benefits, and are more or less fair in decision making, though a little on the low side for incentives and salary.

"Not for the faint of heart","PNC tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all. Even in emergency situations. The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day. For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again. Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Oshtemo, MI","June 5, 2017","3.0"

Management is awesome with all warm and smiling faces. The hardest part of the job would be sitting at a desk alone without anybody around to communicate with while at the same time that is also the best part because it leads to better focus and work flow.

Management (based off of location) is helpful to a point, but often is unavailable for assistance. Every day is different which is exciting but can also cause unneeded stress like most customer service related positions can be.
 Workplace culture is best described as ""every man for themselves"" most days. A few colleagues will band together, but there is a lot of disconnect between management and employees.
 The most enjoyable part of my day is definitely helping clients reach their financial goals. Nothing makes me more excited to walk in the front door, than knowing I can help someone get out of debt, or buy a new house for their family.

The Branch I work at is a steady pace but always busy on the 1st and 3rd. The Pay could be more for the work we do but the benefits help balance that out. I learned to identify false checks, suspicious deposits, and robbery patterns. Our branch was one of few that passed the yearly audit, which I was proud.

I also have clearance to do supervisor duties and task but I'm only a titled as a teller and receive teller pay. I even applied for the job  and was denied it, even though I am currently ""doing"" the job now and has been for the past month. there has been other people here for many years and they said it has been years since the even got a raise in pay. and there are many days we don't even get a lunch because of staffing issues. my branch manager is awesome though and the only reason why PNC got this much of my time","Teller","Current Employee","Ohio","May 11, 2017","2.0"
"Decent place to work....","Nice people to work with. I enjoyed the customer interactions. The training outside of the branch was great but the on-the-job training was non-existent. I wasn't put in a position to succeed. Money wasn't bad, but it was very stressful being put into situations where you didn't know what to do and I couldn't go to anyone in the branch for help.

As I asked questions, gave my time to learn and be attentive I was more so rather ignored, undervalued and not trained to the best of my potential. PNC offers great benefits and I sacrifice my learning attributes.

"More interested in customers than employees","When will they learn that the best way to get your employees to give exceptional customer service is to treat your employees the way you want them to treat the customers?
They give surveys that they coach the employees on how to answer so that the results turn out good but leave you wondering just how reliable the results are. 
There is so much turnover that people who should not be in management are moved into management positions - it's not just the lack of management experience but the overall lack of leadership. 
People were walked out for reasons that were never explained leaving you to wonder if you were doing something wrong and not aware of it and if you were going to be next. 
My observation was that people were often singled out as if they were looking for a way to get rid of them by giving them extra tasks to complete that were not required of others in that position; basically making their life so miserable that they would look for another job.","Sales","Former Employee","Southeast","May 3, 2017","1.0"

If someone finds it difficult to see the good in any situation, they will not be satisfied anywhere they work. 
In general, PNC has been good to me because I have been good to them. Although I have a lot going on in my life, I still manage to come to work with a positive attitudes. You get back what you give and if you are willing to give your best, others will see you shine and great things will happen for you and those who shine with you.

 The whole universal model theyve implemented in branches in which a personal banker does the job of a teller and a sales agent as well as an assistant manager yet only gets paid for one of the titles, is the most unsafe model EVER. in the span of a few months a few branches (INCLUDING where I worked at before transferring) were robbed at gun point. 
 I am on my way out and wouldnt recommend working at any branch that has this universal model but overall i think the company means well and its just filled with too many people who care very little about others and just want to do whatever they can to be liked by the higer ups.","Service Associate I","Former Employee","Atlanta, GA","April 18, 2017","3.0"

"Great company","It was a great place to work with co-workers and a manager (and actually other managers as well) there to give you support.  The training was not as good as it should have been and on-the-job-training was hard to do with everyone with a client and not having someone to help you.  That slowed me down a bit.  My branch was Universal, meaning you worked all aspects of banking.  Teller, platform, and lobby.  Great concept, but hard to do in reality.  However, those that can be persistent and can close sales, you will make a boatload of money.  I loved helping customers.  I didn't like trying to sell to customers unless I knew it would help them out.  Banks are a business and I hate I couldn't be that person they wanted me to be, but they supported me and gave me all sorts of help in trying to make me a better banker.  I have no one to blame but myself.  Geat company with good pay and benefits and time off.

You have to work forced overtime which they have the right to take back. If you live close to their I guess that wouldn't be a problem but if you commute back and forth from the city it can be quite time consuming. They are a 24/7 operation yet there is no flexibility. Everyone talks about everyone and the only way to move up is to best friends with a supervisor or manager.

"Banking is the same anywhere","Banking was fun when I first started but more and more it became mostly about pushing clients into opening accounts and applying for services that were completely unneeded, simply for the fact that each employee has to reach a certain number of accounts on a monthly basis. The job is more about reaching goals and hitting certain numbers rather than actually getting to know your clients and really following them through into the directions they need to go. Many times if you didn't reach your goals at the end of the month, you would have to pull an all-nighter making phone calls to clients with a nice savings account and beg them to come in and turn some of that cash into a frozen long-term account. It was dreadful.","Customer Service Associate","Former Employee","Clifton, NJ","April 5, 2017","4.0"

Also you can't get the vacations you asked for because your last in line so new training classes are not going to get requested time off. They also ask you to open a new bank account one week into classroom trading, don't do it. If they cut you, close the account immediately. Also there is no accountability at the whole company as there is no complaint resolution, except for a call center.

 The staff, managers, and regional managers are absolutely amazing. Always very helpful, very nice and understanding.
 Not only did this job give me the opportunity to meet amazing people, but it gave me life skills that I will carry on with me for the rest of my life such as leaning how to balance a check book, manage not only my bank account, but large amounts of money as well. It taught me security and how to be careful with bank account information, how to apply for a loan, how to manage a loan, how to apply for a credit card, how to manage credit cards, mortgages, how to apply for one, what's expected when applying for a mortgage, the process, etc.
 The hardest part of the job is watching out for scam artists. Some people aren't as nice and honest as you think. Customers will come in trying to be someone else with fake IDs, you will run into TONS of counterfeit money, but learn how to catch it, and managing thousands of dollars all at once. You definitely have to learn how to keep track of it at all times.

"Great corporate company but retail banking is lacking","PNC is an advanced company with great benefits.  The pay is very low in comparison with other banks and for what you are expected to do.  It is a pushy sales environment because that is the only way employees can make any extra money.  The benefits are great except for the health insurance. The sales nature of the business puts employees in competitive situations which causes a lot of drama in the branches.  People are fighting over referrals and doing unethical things to make more money.  Management encourages this because their bonus is based off of the branches referrals.  The managers are not qualified.  Just because you have a degree does not mean that you are a good leader.  The turnover rate would be lower if they actually invested in their employees.   But you can't do that when the branches are always short staffed because they don't pay enough.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Manteo, NC","February 8, 2017","2.0"

"People Who Care But Are Not Cared For","Work life balance is miserable, the department is understaffed, pay is too low to incentivize people to stay, trainers are overwhelmed with constant new hires and floor-level managers are far more stressed than they should be because upper management keeps pushing for them to have good performance despite their undertrained staff. Training timetables are repeatedly rolled back to have enough people on the phones and it noticeably affects the quality of the work. The incentive to perform is based on avoiding things you will be punished for rather than bonuses for meeting or beating goals. Again, the pay for the work is laughable, there are factory jobs in town requiring no computer skills or extensive training that pay as much or better than this position. Upper management is utterly unwilling to invest in the base-pay and number of staff necessary to keep the call center operating as intended. If you're going to be temporarily ""stuck"" someplace it's better than a minimum wage job, by far, but for any kind of substantive, appreciable career-type job it falls depressingly short as an employer. Everyone in town seems to know someone who worked there, and they do, because the rate of turnover is so high just about everyone in town -has- worked there. A better place to be from than to be at.","Detection and Investigation Analyst","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","February 6, 2017","2.0"

You can't plan your life with this job. Even when you off or on vacation you will always receive stressing calls from managers or co-workers. Mandatory no overtime which is sucks. Schedule planning is horrible. You work 40 hours/week for 6 days (sometimes 7 days). The biggest and annoying part of this job was the call nights or multi-channel calls.

I typical day at work consists of me running around from platform to teller side all day even though I was told before hire and during training that there would be designated days when I would work each side so it wouldn't become overwhelming. Other than your 2 weeks vacation (and you have to take one full consecutive week) and 10 paid holidays you really have no work life balance. I know that sounds a lot but think about it, if the day you have off is a holiday what can you really get done that day? My coworkers are great though.

"Heartbroken and Disappointed","I worked for PNC Bank bank for almost 6 years. Started as a Teller and moved my way up to a Branch Manager.  Never once left the company for more money at other banks because I was loyal to PNC. Never in 6 years was there a huge complaint on me or was I ever investigated for anything. Loved the people that I worked with in my branch as well as a few of my business partners, coworkers, and direct managers.  Turned the branch I managed from the bottom branch in our region into one of the top performing branches.  Now with all that back ground I will give you the rest of the story. I was in the process of being investigated for some ridiculous things that had pretty much nothing to do with banking and everything to do with my personal life. Which let me say is not very exciting or active. During the interview I will take responsibility for not completely giving accurate information in the beginning but before the interview was over I gave the information they asked again correctly.  Once the investigation was complete I was let go because I did not give the accurate answer the first time.  Even though I gave them the accurate answer when they said they were going to ask me one more time in the end.  Do I feel I was without wrong in the situation NO but do I feel that I was wronged by a company I was loyal to for almost 6 year YES!!!!!

Micro-managed to the max (needed to know what you were doing every minute of the day).  Back-office individuals don't contact you, just go behind your back with everything that happens.

"Never again.","I felt completely out of place the first week I started at PNC. The managers were always down my throat about sales goals, and incentives, whilst I was still in the learning process. We (as tellers) weren't really allowed to do anything besides transactions, and we weren't to know to much information about credit cards or accounts, because it wasn't our job to know, it was our job to sit them down with a personal banker, and there job was to sell any product they could to them. I had balancing issues there, and I have never had that problem with anywhere else, including working at credit union prior to that. I never felt like I could go to the managers, because I always felt that they were judging me and wanted me out of there before I even began to take root. Plus the assistant manager was leaving for other job interviews, even though she was supposed to be working, and would leave us swamped. ( If that doesn't tell you why not to work for PNC then I don't know what does.) Better offers, better opportunity is out there. This bank pays extremely low, and for the pressure and the work required I am glad I am not there anymore. I was let go from the company which is fine. I did not like it there, and I will never work for a bank again. There whole goal in life is to sell products, and the rates are so low, I would never recommend putting any of your money with them.

"Not a good place to work","I am currently employed with PNC bank, so this is not a a former employee that is angry with the company.
It is not a good place to work if you are on the front line with direct customer engagement. It actually borders on hostile from management to meet sales goals, or else.. They pay is well below market and the benefits are terrible. 
As a senior relationship manager, I am required to be on the road most of the time, visiting business clients and driving new business. They recently announced that the bank would no longer reimburse any cell phone expense or any expense over $30 unless it was pre approved by management.
 My region, which has 1200 employees, has lost and had to replace 600 of the 1200 employees every year for the past 3 years. Numerous retail managers  I work directly with have had to take stress related leave due to the over all work conditions.
It appears that most of the positive reviews about PNC seem to come from back office employees that shuffle paper and have no customer interaction.

"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone","The benefits seem great at first. Until you take vacation they told you was available for use and you quit then you have to pay that all back. Why make that time available? PNC doesn't care about their employees as they don't compensate for the work that's expected. Additionally it's difficult to advance, it doesn't matter if you're the top performer management seems to find a reason to decline a promotion. Management is picky in who they hire, so it takes MONTHS to fill a position, only for a short time later that position to be vacant again (there seems to be a high turnover percentage). Branches are always short staffed which makes it difficult for the employees working because even more work gets put on them. However, I will say the most enjoyable part were the co-workers and the hours.

I did like my management and co-workers as I am still in contact with most of them even after I quit.  They became more than just my co-workers, they became dear friends as well.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say was trying to get referrals in the drive thru because usually people were in a hurry to get in, get out, and get done.  I was able to get some customers to upgrade accounts or get new ones once in a while but when they wanted to get done so quickly, it did make it a little more difficult.
The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that I got to meet new people and help them the best that I could.  Some of my favorite customers also became friends and to this day we are still in contact and keep in touch.","Drive Thru Teller","Former Employee","Pickerington, OH","September 14, 2016","3.0"

There was something different each day and that is exciting to me. When I was in the office, my co-workers were outstanding and very friendly.

The 24/7 on-call schedule is the hardest part of the job, but I also like the excitement of addressing and finding solutions to on-going customer concerns and responding to emergencies situations on a 24/7 schedule. By keeping busy and doing something different each day I find property management to be very enjoyable.

 In regards to learning, I learned a lot about financial products and how they work such as mortgages. I learned how to provide really good customer service. 
 Management was very respectful but many times somewhat hypocritical in their demands for meeting goals.

"Stressful environment for low pay but provides good experience and benefits if you stay long enough.","I've been with the bank for four years in two separate positions. In both positions I've been one of the top performers in my region but nothing is ever good enough and getting anything above an mediocre review and subsequently a decent raise is extremely difficult. They will always find one category you didn't hit goal at and use it to justify their position. Bonuses can be great or horrible depending on your position and time of year. The incentive plan changes all the time. They have gone as far as to change incentive negatively for products you've already sold but of course only positively for future sales. Turnover is extremely high and staffing is a constant issue. It's not uncommon to run at half staff for months at a time, meanwhile the goals and expectations stay the same. It's not uncommon that you have to do two people's jobs. Then of course you work constant overtime and take short or no lunch. I've had co-workers quit and walk out, go to lunch and never come back, no call no show for days then quit, have panic attacks at work and have to leave, all because of the stress level and demands of the job. The benefits package is nice but you have to be with the company for 6 months before you get your full benefits and 3 years before your vested in their 401(k) and pension. So if you leave for any reason before 3 years, you lose them.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","August 7, 2016","2.0"

The  only thing is that working here is not compatible with someone living on their own especially supporting children. The company expects to receive more than what they put out. If you want your employees to be the best you need to have something to put out, to motivate them. Health benefits are ridiculous, very expensive. There is no room for advancement and if there is any it is extremely hard to reach. They tend to hire from outside rather than promote from within.

Not the client centric bank it originated from due to chasing stock price of 100$ per share. Every change that came down the river was a negative one towards ground level employees in the branches/call centers, which was very often because I feel PNC is trying to find their identity in the retail banking world.

I would also complete the training for new tellers which began at corporate in a classroom environment.  I was in charge of all the operations in the branch which included ordering cash and cash supplies, rectifying customer issues, completing weekly schedules, and balancing the branch's on hand cash.  When one of the teller's vaults came up short $20,000, a full investigation proceeded from which management decided that I was not trained well enough for my job and I was demoted to a teller.  At that point, I wasn't making enough money to live and I had to leave.  I enjoyed seeing the same customers and developing a good relationship with them.  I didn't enjoy seeing the deceit among employees which included suspicion or thievery as well as jealousy of pay grade and positions in the company.","Teller Branch Supervisor","Former Employee","Hershey, PA","May 19, 2016","4.0"

"Average place to work for","A typical day would consist of ""morning huddles"" that would consists of everyone's daily goals and additional comments on how we would achieve our individual goals. The branch needs to meet a certain quota every day in order to maintain success - which was difficult depending on your tea. Management was always very helpful and willing to assist their employees whenever needed. Depends on which branch you are work for the employees are hit or miss, but for the most part they're enjoyable and somewhat helpful.

The most successful companies are always the ones who have staffing that work together and enjoy what they do. I have done my best to practice a famous tenet of the late, great Maya Angelo ""I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" I will always make an attempt to leave a coworker, peer, boss, team leader, call center rep, or even my regional manager with a feeling of the fact they are in great hands and the rest outcome will be the result of our interaction.","Customer Service Associate","Current Employee","North Wildwood, NJ","May 16, 2016","5.0"

"Good for experience, but management will hold you back.","I was a Teller with PNC for roughly 1 year. A typical day consisted of taking care of customers deposits, answering questions, providing assistance with any issues within my capacity to solve all while following corporate policies and procedures.
 While I was there, I learned to become comfortable providing a substantially higher level of customer service than ever before. I became able to practice and perfect selling products and services to people of many walks of life, and in exchange I also became a much more outgoing person. I learned a lot about the banking industry (with some limitations) as well as the way that banks attempt to protect their customers from fraud.
 Management was a mixed bag; some days my boss would seem like a team player with a soul who wanted me to succeed, and on other days they would seem as if I was just another replaceable employee with whom they had limited tolerance due to the ramifications of unemployment insurance. Upper management was, in my best opinion, people in suits who saw entry level employees who barely did their job, even if there was physical data to prove otherwise.
 My co-workers were the highlight of my time with PNC. They are to this day some of the smartest people I have ever had the opportunity to work with.
 The hardest part of my job as a Teller with PNC bank was the unrealistic sales goals and micromanaging. If you're reading this and considering working for PNC as a Teller, be prepared to learn that yesterdays successes become tomorrows expectations.

No set guidelines or procedures you just have to figure it out as you go along.  Some area's of the business such as Documentation are always under staffed and over worked.  This area is very high stress with no relief in sight.  They have silo mentality between business units. It is very rare that knowledge is shared between business units.  Thinking outside of the box is some what discouraged.  It depends on your personality whether or not you would like PNCEF as a place to work.

My job title can be listed as Business Banking Collector, Default Specialist, Business Banking Customer Service Rep, or Special Assets Coordinator. All of these titles are equally correct. My job is much more than just calling people who haven't paid their bills on time. I work with small business owners on a daily basis. These people care deeply about their banking relationships. They must be treated with the utmost respect, in order to ensure a healthy and mutually beneficial business relationship. I always give my clients the benefit of the doubt. I investigate the cause of delinquency before contacting anyone. I check loan agreements, branch notes, customer service notes and all recent payment transactions. A big part of my job is to fix bank errors before they become customer irritations. There are many variables at play when investigating delinquency. Adjustments are a positive alternative to collection calls. As a courtesy, I always contact the client's Relationship Manager in order to make them aware of the necessary adjustments. However, there are times when the client is simply not able to make a payment. People react to the stress differently.

I started bright-eyed and bushy tailed like the rest of my peers, constantly asking for feedback and doing the best that I could even though my manager I'd been assigned had passed me off to someone else before my first day even arrived.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get my questions answered when there was no one available to answer them, and then being told my work wasn't up to their standards after having a lack of support and feedback like I asked from the beginning.  The company culture described to me was friendly and inviting and open to questions, however what I experienced was cut-throat, behind your back, every man for himself attitude.

During these conversations, I helped to identify the right customers who could benefit, and provided conversational techniques that could be used to refer branch customers to Wealth Management.  Often I made outbound calls directly and met with customers.  Throughout my career I created sales training materials that were effective in these activities.  In addition, I created reports to measure progress toward sales goals, and analyze bottlenecks in the sales process. These reports tracked the value of the pipeline, number of referrals, and tracked closed sales.  My role was to act as a liaison between Wealth Management and the Retail Bank, to resolve issues regarding awarded incentives for closed sales, recognize successes and support the Wealth Management sales team.  As the most tenured in my role, I was often called upon to create new processes and train other employees in my similar role.  I helped to set sales goals each year. I partnered with Marketing to create and implement sales educational materials that were used companywide, and recommended sales processes and strategies to senior management.

"Would not recommend working for PNC","They have a survey system in which you need to have a 4.8 to a 5 to be green. If you aren't corporate will not get off your back. You have very little control over what the customers say on these surveys; many times they aren't even rating you as an employee. They are rating the bank as a whole, or a different employee. Some people give all 4's because they don't believe anyone can be perfect and that everyone has room for improvement. It's a rolling score so all 4's will mess you up for the next year. There was a time when my co-worker got a 2.8 because a customer was convinced the upgrade that was done for him was the reason he subsequently had his identity stolen. I had another co-worker get a 2 because our branch wasn't handicap accessible. The comments to these surveys come out a few weeks after the fact and corporate does not care if the bad score you got was not your fault. Completely unfair system, way too much pressure. They continuously punish you and make you feel terrible about your scores if they aren't good even if you try really hard to do well.
 Corporate spends tons of money on ideas that don't work. When employees give feedback about things not working they do not care, they just say do it anyway which leads to people wasting tons of time trying to make it look like they are using the tools that corporate wants them to even when they aren't because they don't make any sense. They under pay all of their employees.

"Good entry level position.","If you are just starting off this is a good job for you, especially if you are a great salesperson.
They don't offer full time positions. They rarely ever promote within. They pay is the lowest in the industry. High sales demand on tellers is stressful. They don't give Christmas bonus, no perks like free lunch or free anything. Management has even suggest that we pay out of our own pocket to buy things for customers to show customer appreciation. They strong arm us to make donations out of our own pocket. Many of the tellers qualify for welfare because of the low wages.  
 The healthcare is horrible, prescriptions are not covered. You are only given two personal days per year in the first year, for sick or vacation you only get two days.

None of the promises I was made in the beginning of my career ever became a reality, and it did not take long to realize that the only reason I was hired was because they needed bodies, not because they valued my experience, skills, and me as an employee.

I have a great relationship with my manager and my coworkers. In fact, my manager knows that I am looking for employment outside of PNC Bank because our opportunities for advancement aren't as high as they use to be in previous years.

I was let go when they found another person that could do my job at 5 branches for $10,000 less per year than what I was making. They let go 9 total people in the area when they closed the branch, and fired all of them before the day before the branch closed so that they could avoid having to pay severance. When we all went to file for unemployment, PNC told unemployment that we were all let go due to insubordination - which unemployment quickly caught on to and made PNC Pay us unemployment.

It's a lie they care about you if your not a teller. Second sales oriented ok I understand all companies are about making money but at a bank you always see the same people so it's frustrating when you shove credit cards down the throats of the same people every week then when the customer flips out on you for annoying them it's your fault for not positioning the ""conversation"" correctly. Third the amount your salary is at pnc is peanuts for the amount of stuff your required to do. And if you end up in the Lehigh valley region in pa your job is threated daily if your not performing to expectations. The amount of stress I endured working there cause me to develop medical issues that I now take pills to prevent. And the high deductibles from there insurance plans didn't make it easy for me to get medical attention for the issues developing from the stress.

"Solid Company but lacking in advancement opportunities","A typical day for me consists of early morning conference calls followed by outside sales activation. Everyday my work location varies based on events scheduled for the week. I've learned how to juggle personal sales goals and management of a sales force including relationship building within a large market. Management doesn't seemed to be aligned with customer facing employees throughout the market which is a key factor in me seeking new employment. There is a very high turnover of employees in the company which makes it difficult to establish best practices that lead to positive results. The hardest pat of my job is having to deal with so many different personalities without any real support from my direct management. Philadelphia is the largest market in the company and I'm equipped with a team of four to meet the demands of such a large network. The best part of my job is that I am not tied down to any office as I am part of a mobile team.

"Great benefits, but unsure if it can hold up the remaining mess...","PNC is not a bad company to work for. The benefits are, in fact, rather exceptional, with health, vision, dental, and even a 401(k) plan matching at 4%. A lot of times, however, it does appear that upper management seems to be running in circles. I work in the branch in downtown Mechanicsburg where our regional manager's office resides, so you'd think they'd have a more keen sense on what's going on - they don't. Our regional manager is up a flight of stairs no more than 10 steps, and he JUST learned my name a few weeks ago - I got hired in February and it's now the end of October.
 When it comes to the sales side of things, it's not difficult to make goals. You do get a nice compensation depending on what job position you take. If you're in it for a bit of ""commission"" then you're better off going for a Financial Sales Consultant role and should steer clear of a Teller or Customer Service Associate. Depending on how many accounts you open, credit cards you sell, loans you apply for, or even referrals you submit, you'll earn $6. You could spend 10 minutes opening an account for $6, where at the same time you could apply for a loan, have to keep an eye on it for weeks, keep in contact with them and up to date about it, and set yourself reminders to continuously observe the status of it and ultimately set up an appointment for a loan closing (sometimes months later). How much do you get for that? $6 (that's if you're a customer service associate - financial sales consultant works a bit differently). The nice thing, however, is that if you refer a customer to Investments and - more...","Customer Service Associate","Current Employee","Mechanicsburg, PA","October 26, 2015","3.0"

There are levels that are very committed to an agile form of project management while the underlying management takes that with a grain of salt and proceeds to move forward with their own ideology and process. There is a great deal of dysfunction in this organization that would lead one to believe that it is impossible to predict how a career would go, let alone the first year of employment.  As a former military member it is easy to see from a team perspective that this is a recipe for disaster.

"You Are Just A Number and Customer Service is Awful. Stressful and Low Pay","This company has changed a lot in the last few years. They are getting rid of workers all of the time. You are just a number hence why job security is one star. One mistake and you are gone. 6 months ago i went from sitting in a room of tellers and now sit in a room of new tellers. They fired a woman who has worked here 30 years because of one mistake. Took benefits away from her 6 months before retirement! Training is a month long and worthless. You are told to sell to people no matter the situation, if the teller line is full of people you still have to tell a person in a hurry to leave, if they would like a credit card it's B.S. and to top it off they are always understaffed so if someone wants a credit card they have to make an appointment to see a banker a few days later! you get 6 dollars for referrals. They also have customer survey scores and you and the rest of the team get bonuses when the group scored highly BUT you need a 4.8 score out of 5 which is impossible because so many customers come in angry because we have new people working every week and we are always understaffed. If you want to work at a bank don't work for this one especially if you're just starting out, you make 9-10 dollars an hour to be way too stressed out because of sales, making customers happy in an environment that is impossible to do so, and being worried you wont have a job tomorrow.","Customer Representative","Current Employee","Rockford IL","October 20, 2015","2.0"

 They told us that these jobs which were mostly based on the East Coast (Philadelphia and Boston) were ideal for Pittsburgh, but they abruptly had a change of heart and let go our entire floor, roughly 100 workers.  
 Regulated investment companies was an short stop during my 25 years of work experience.  It wasn't a bad position, but the daily commute to downtown Pittsburgh was typically a 3 hour time period each day, both ways.

"It was okay","ona regular day you would be answering phone calls concerning PNC account holders about overdraft refunds, balances, online banking or any other type of banking question. I've learned a lot about everyday banking and step to prevent an overdraft from occuring. The co workers are amazing and are the most help when it comes to questions, whereas I found it very difficult to find a manager to answer questions or take an escalated phone call. But it pays very well and the hours are decent, plus you have every holiday off. The only downside is you have to be okay with hear customers cry or yell on the phone while still denying their request but if you can get over that your perfect.","Call Center Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 29, 2015","3.0"
"High turnover, questionable practices","In 2014 PNC hired 700 new employees, within 12 months 600 of them were gone. Experienced many questionable practices, particularly with Quality scoring, which I saw as their was as knocking down the bonus one qualified for.   Coaches are young and over the top arrogant, not in the least bit constructive, if anything,  they drove down moral;  management seemed to have their back all the way, no matter what. The supervisor I worked under was noticeably insecure and gravitated to the brown nosers, leadership skills were very almost no existent.  Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) were welcomed because they gave a moment of relief from being on the phones, sadly the Quick Starts became as daunting as being on the phones because all they were about was applauding for the  top performers followed up by a pressure to raise the bar. In order to drive you, you're scores would be posted for everyone to see where you stood in the pecking order. There were lot's  of contests to help drive you and ongoing pot lucks. Be prepared to donate, donate, donate. And if you're not the type to run around to be ""In a click"", then you were going to be seen as an outsider. Overall PNC struck me as a very paranoid  and oppressive organization, top-down. I'm all for hard work, but not having the life sucked out of me.","Multi Channel Customer Service","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","September 29, 2015","2.0"

"Too Big to Connect","At PNC it can be hard to connect the large mission of the organization with the front lines.  PNC says a lot about finding, developing, and retaining good talent, but the bottom line is that they don't put their money and resources where their talk is. Lately, PNC has been all about cutting expenses and growing revenue. While I completely understand why this is important for any business, the extremes that PNC has taken have limited the ability of its employees and managers to connect and grow. Instead, they've cut employee benefits, salaries for internal candidates are not competitive, and stress on the individual contributor and local managers is through the roof.  The first and second level managers care and want to help grow the individual employees, but they are limited by bureaucracy and red tape.  PNC is the largest company I've worked for, so my comparative experience is limited. I have given PNC the benefit of doubt for so long, but I do feel they could do much better.","CRR Team Lead","Current Employee","Cherry Hill, NJ","September 22, 2015","3.0"

"Have a plan if you are going to work here","For technical positions it has been my experience that PNC is great at allowing time to work from home, and having a work balance that generally allows people to stick to a 40 hour work week. This does come at the cost of nearly non-existent opportunities for advancement within the company, extremely antiquated technology, and highly dogmatic practices that requires a board of upper level managers to review and approval any code change (including 1-line code changes). For these reasons it appears the best employees for this culture are people looking for a secure opportunity that will last them until retirement. Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here must take it upon themselves to ensure they are working on the right type and quantity of projects, and right types of technology, to keep their skills marketable in this antiquated and highly bureaucratic system.","Senior Software Engineer","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 4, 2015","2.0"

"Do not!","I worked for PNC for 7 years. The ever changing policies and procedures made it impossible to do my job consistently. The ""goals"" were pretty much unattainable, especially since I worked in the  drive thru location most of the time.  Half of the co workers did very little work, shuffling papers and ""answering"" phones to look busy. Wages were laughable. Upper management did not care about employees AT ALL. Many customers closed accounts and walked because of the ever changing policies. Schedules were out usually a few days before that week started, we never knew what we were working until the day before. Schedules were supposed to be out a month in advance, but rarely were. My main concern was with district and regional management. They had no clue what customers needs and wants were, and they simply did not care. All but ONE branch was closed in my town, making it inconvenient for customers to get to. PNC as a whole does not care about customers or employees.

I do not like the hour long commute to work and the work schedule is very oddly done.  There is no organization or pattern with the schedule at all.  Before I got hired, there were four individuals who quit because of the odd schedule.  I would not quit because of that because I do really like the work and my co-workers.  Also, I have dealt with a lot worse schedules while being in the military.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Delaware","August 16, 2015","3.0"
"Not for the faint of heart","At the end of the day, the idea is to take accountability for the ill informed decisions, bad PNC policies, or poor judgment of customers.
 You are told to take ownership, and positively position everything. That includes saying no to refunds (which you have exactly 0 control over). You are encouraged to make conversations your own- but also fulfill requirement x,y,z,1,4,7,9 or else all of your evaluations and scores will be terrible. Scoring and evaluations are currently pretty subject to the person who is completing the analysis. 
 Scores are paramount and dictate whether you can do anything but exist in the call center. You are timed as to how long you are in your chair each day as well which I understand but also find awful. If you miss your break, it's gone because if you take it past the allotted time it can great affect your adherence. Constant contact with generally upset, unhappy, irate customers is one thing- the stress of trying to control and change everything that comes out of your mouth is a whole new level of anxiety. 
 Management is inconsistent as is support for when you are in the position. I was pretty much thrown on the phone full time after a terrible training experience, and almost was fired within the first month due to misinformation I had been given.
 PNC tries to make this position tolerable in small ways but in the end- it is what it is. Taking back to back phone calls for 7.5 hours for a company that in the end only cares about one thing with customers who don't care about what you have to say.","Customer Care Center","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 16, 2015","2.0"

"Micro management , very poor training , nice offices , very clicky, in underwriting not one manager / team does anything the same or any of the center","Very poor training~I was a temporary senior underwriter employee hired in to help with the back flow of underwriting ! Everything I was told by the recruiter was not true/ or correct! It was somewhat of a BATE and SWITCH technique! Travel was a cluster mess - hotels were supposed to be paid for when we checked in ~ they were not we had to pay for two weeks of a hotel stay and get reimbursed - which recruiter and manager said it would ALL be paid for! MICRO management is not the word ( and I was a remote employee! My manager was a very pushy rushing person who did not take any time to explain anything - just thought that the one week in impact traing (system) would be enough - which would be if it was properly done! My former manager cannot keep an in office employee at all she has lost three employees in three weeks ( I was told ) and one girl left bc manager told her she got up out of her seat too much ( mind you she was using bathroom and getting water and making phone calls on breaks to her newborn daughter who was being watched ) and yet she was hitting her numbers and completing all work at a timely manner! Not one of the managers or teams or operation centers do anything the same - others rec'd better training depending what team you were on! Worst bank I have ever worked for ! I've been underwriting for over ten years and in the mortgage banking business for 19 years ! I was treated like a child im 40 years old !!!

"Very Deceptive Company","Be wary about starting a career with this company!  I was an employee for two years.  Started as a CSA which turned into a Universal Branch Consultant.  The amount of work that is put on you is nothing less than stressful to the point of needing a psychologist.  There are before hours conference calls, and mandatory after hours cold calling.  You are NOT in the best interest of the customer.  You are stressed because of CIQ (Customers rating of how well you kissed their butt), and managerial lack of engagement.  When I asked for a raise to the Regional Manger (due to all the responsibilty I had taken on in the past year), I was told...""I guess you should have negotiated better when you started, huh?""  That was the true PNC coming out...A few months later I was discharged for no reason at all.  They seriously are out for profit, not to help customers financially.

Managements job primarily is to make sure that all goals are met regarding sales & customer service scores. In addition to ensuring that policy and procedures are being followed at all times. Everything is very team oriented with regards to both wins and losses as a branch. Therefore, a morning huddle is done each day to ensure that the branch team is on the same page. I have learned how to seriously multitask and continuously learn how to prioritize according to urgency. Some challenges may have included dealing with needy or disgruntled customers on occasions. Nevertheless, when I see that someone has truly been blessed by my services that definitely puts a smile on my face.

"Not a great company to work for.","- At PNC Bank, the training was really bad. The content of the CSR's and Branch employees is almost nonexistent. 
- PPO medical insurance is all that is offered. 
- Schedule SUCKS!!! You never get 2 days off in a row. That's tiring after a while. 
 The employee assessments were pretty much made up of weekly call scoring. The process is not consistent and was just a horrible process. 
 PNC thinks pretending to be nice on the phone is a good way to cover up our lack of knowledge. I am a type of person that loves to help people when I can, PNC's policies and lack to content training makes it almost impossible to give great customer service. They rant on and on about confidence on calls, confidence to PNC is making stuff up on the phone to sound like truth. I've had coaches tell me to get better at making stuff up. 
 I HATED working there. I left before a year because I couldn't stomach working for such an incompetent corporation. I've worked at Bank of America before and LOVED it. If you want to work for a bank, choose another one to apply to. Be warned. There are a lot of middle (little) men at PNC.

Sometimes there are things out of your control in life and you just have to accept that fact. The most enjoyable part of my job working as a customer service representative was that when I was able to help others I was not only helping them, but I was supporting there decisions and making sure that they knew that when something went wrong that I was there to help them the best that I could. Also, I loved working there because you could help people plan for their futures. Far and wide. You could help people. Even around the world.

Typically, getting promoted takes longer period, averagely 4 years. Benefit/compensation program is not the best in the industry. Colleagues and management are friendly and fun to work with. If you're a starter in banking, then I recommend. But if you're looking at better compensation and quick promotions, then you're are looking in the wrong direction.

Her superiors were very nice, and very understanding of my scheduling needs and availability. I guess depending on the location, you may either sit at your computer scrolling through the same news feeds day after day, or you may be on your feet running back and forth for hours. Hour long lunch breaks, VERY nice. Shifts were reasonable, and it was fantastic to have every sunday and most of saturday off.

You are a machine and cannot even pay your own bills. It's disgraceful that a company who makes so much money pays so little and will hold you back when you try to post out. Your job in banking will soon be outsourced by technology. Find something better, it's not at PNC.

 My coworkers are all seasoned and willing to assist in any knowledge exchange or back log scenario and management is equally willing as well. A strong team ethic is apparent and management certainly encourages it.

"Draining place to work.","I transferred from a PNC customer care center to a branch location in another state! I have been in my new environment for a very short time (1 month) and can already feel the pressure of management for sales production. Although the morale of the employees is very low at the customer care center, outbound sales level...the morale of the employees at the branch level is extremely low. There is a severe disconnect between service partners within the company (branch/experiential team). 
Absolutely no work/life balance. I gave my manager my cell number the first week of starting...I thought for emergency purposes, but I've been receiving off the clock group  text messages (before and after work) inquiring about sales and how the sales for the next day better increase... for the last 2 weeks. 
The training for an internal transfer from a customer care center to a branch is ineffective. Although sales and sales conversations are similar, branch operations (security, policy and procedures) are very different. I was given some web-based training, that really had nothing to do with my new role and I am now expected to be a pro at the branch level as a universal sales consultant.
I also found out through other employees and now receiving emails from people I don't even know, that I am expected to volunteer off the clock time to events that are happening within the community, to get the PNC brand out.

"Productive work environment with opportunities for advancement.","Typically my day begins by opening the branch, going over our plans for the day with each other so we know who's doing what, communication.  From there my day consists of calling clients, assisting clients who visit the branch, doing outreach events during the day for the community.
 My direct manager is great, our regional manager gives very inconsistent goals and expectations.  I'm a firm believer that in banking, there is a balance of sales and operations.  If the branch is operationally sound, things run smoother, safety is upheld and we can produce more effectively.  However, any time we tried to ensure all team members had an equal opportunity to spend time on operations, we were scolded.  So my direct manager is outstanding, PNC upper management is not supportive or understanding.  I will give an example, I had serious back surgery 3 months ago, I was out for a month.  I received a phone call from my regional manager questioning whether I had cleared that leave with my manager....not how are you feeling, but simply scolding me.  I filed for leave well in advance, notified my manager who gets correspondence from PNC leave.  So to me that was completely out of line.  To even think I took a month off and told no one was absurd.
 One of the things that drew me to PNC was the fact they preached about a work life balance.  I've found that is truthfully not the case.  There are constant events that we are asked to attend outside of normal schedules, nights, Sundays (Mother's Day)......things that are not possible for me with a 2 year old daughter and my wife being a FT nurse. - more...","Universal Branch Consultant","Current Employee","Alpharetta, GA","May 20, 2015","1.0"

I also love my manager, she is very involved and always available if needed. But, I haven't had an entire weekend off for a month and likely won't until July. Saturdays off are supposed to rotate. They do offer benefits, but the health insurance and dental plans aren't the best. The deductible is over 2 grand for health insurance and the dental plan has a $1,500 annual cap. Hourly pay is ok, but don't plan on being able to support yourself solely on this income (Unless you are a platform banker, then you may have a chance). One highlight is that we get an hour for lunch, the con is long work days. Fridays are usually 7:45 am to 6:15 pm. Then you have to be back Saturday morning at 7:45 am. Most days you are 7:45 am to 5:15 pm. But some days you may be 10-2 or 9-5.

Management can be very pushy about sales but they definitely provide us recognition for accomplishing our goals. Full staff at the branch is a maximum of 5 employees including the manager. The hardest part of the job is overcoming the fear of approaching customers while they are food shopping.

"Not the job it's presented to be!!","Similar to another review I saw on here, the job I was hired for and the job I performed were two completely different things. Banking is moving in general to a universal banker format where everyone in the branches are required to do everything. Branches are forced to make a ridiculous amount of cold calling to try to drive in appointment traffic to sell products to customers. My particular branch was constantly short staffed. I was forced to work overtime for weeks on end. My manager would also show up and leave whenever he wanted claiming to be out on ""business calls"" from which our team never seemed to see any business. I was trained for platform banking and was never allowed to do anything with it. Times when we would be short a banker for a random reason they would want to throw me on having no real training. There is no real room for growth either which was very upsetting. Regardless of whether I tried to go the banker path or the teller supervisor path, I was shut down and faced with obstacles. I was also made to cover the teller supervisor position for a few months and given no additional compensation or opportunity for advancement. Maybe if you are a young kid and want a decent job while living at home this could be a good opportunity for you. However, the salary does not make it possible for you to live as an independent adult.

I learned a lot about the bank setting and how to handle cash, and maintain the operations side of the bank in order. I managed three tellers under my supervision and assigned them personal goals to ensure the branch achieved their monthly goals.

"Retail Banking in Grocery Stores Fails to Deliver","My position was placed inside of a supermarket where we would attempt to leverage banking needs to people buying their dinner, weekly groceries, or even their lunch - many failures existed and a lot of the opportunities were dead-leads. 
 The exhausting 10 week training course was great for someone like myself who was unfamiliar with retail banking concepts, but the repetitive nature became annoying quickly and felt like the company wasted time with internal principles that didn't fully apply to my position. They really didn't set an employee up to be successful in the supermarket banking world and could have provided more training to overcome objections and develop sales strategies. 
 One thing this company fails to understand in the Mid-Atlantic area is their branches in supermarkets are failing - plagued with overly high turn over, poor foot traffic, and ineffective marketing strategies for these branches it caused employees who have terrible attitudes about their jobs. I had the displeasure of being hired before a branch was built fully and was forced to float around the area -  not only did I meet many dissatisfied people who could careless about their jobs at PNC, I witnessed many people simply quit from their jobs on a weekly basis. 
 As for the compensation it was rather minimal for myself and colleagues as a traditional branch brought more foot traffic in than we did and we were highly overstaffed with employees waiting for our new branch to be built / finished. Moreover, had my manager not been very supporting I wouldn't have stayed past training.

The interactions may be as simple as changing a pin number on a debit card to helping a client recover from being a victim of fraud. Each integration is unique and the work to conclude it can take from 2 minutes to many days. During each interaction my goal is to gain a full financial picture for the client. I want to make sure they understand their banking, have proper protection on their finances, have a true financial goal and plans to achieve it as well as to make sure that they are receiving all the benefits that their bank has to offer.

They hire the wrong people and blame you for not being able to turn them into selling all stars when they've had absolutely no selling experience. Micromanagement and favoritism among employees with no sense of recognition. No wonder why PNC has so many job openings, too much turnover, it's because they can't hire the right people and when they do, they do not pay well at all. I would not work for PNC ever again nor recommend them to anyone.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","OHIO","February 15, 2015","3.0"

"High pressure, little mgmt support, poor executive staff","Branch roles are all about sales and very little about service. Company executives expect a 30+ min solutions assessment conversation with ""every"" customer or you must explain why you didnt have the conversation. Highly micromanaged with little support from upper mgmt. Lobby engagement - or the ""WalMart greeter"" job - is unpopular with customers and staff but upper mgmt insists on making the staff perform it. 
 Some branch managers were absolutely horrible - one in particular went thru 14 employees in 2 years - yet was not only supported by but promoted by regional mgmt. You have to be really liked by someone with influence or with a member of upper management to get promoted. You will not be promoted on skill alone (but this may be symptomatic of corp American in general).","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Indiana","February 9, 2015","2.0"

I was going to get hired on permanently and they told me that.  I thought that I had a job to grow from and I would be there for some years to come.  I did everything they asked me to do and they told me that they where going to hire me and they turned around and gave the job to a person that was always late, or calling off and hardly knew what she was doing.

"Bait and Switch at Miracle Mile","I applied for a CSA position, and was hired.  I was informed that I would be working mainly at a service desk, with limited time on the teller line ( I was told 90% service desk / 10% teller line).  I found this to be acceptable, having 8 years of banking experience, I was interested in learning more about customer service / account opening and sales than working on the teller side. I was completely mislead.  I worked at the Miracle Mile branch for 8 months, and in that eight months, was on the teller line everyday, with very minimal time at a service desk. The turn over rate for tellers at this branch is ridiculous, I believe this is due to low wages and incredibly poor management skills. These employees must handle extremely large amounts of cash and are faced with the possibility of armed robbery daily, stress levels are through the roof.   I inquired with my manager, and she reacted in a very unprofessional manor.  I was then berated as to who told me this information, which by the way, she did and basically, I was treated as though I was being reprimanded, for inquiring about my current position.  In truth, I feel I was hired for one position, and the manager just placed me where she needed a body. At this point, I decided that there was something drastically wrong with what I had been told at the interview, and with the treatment I received from the management. I knew that I was never going to be able to perform the position that I had been hired for.  So within a month,  I found a position with another company, paying much better and without the micromanaging.

Have you seen Office Space? 
You will be told the same thing by multiple bosses.
You will be ridiculed and penalized for doing non-work things even when there hasn't been anyone at the bank in hours.
You will be lectured about how you should be getting more people to sign up for accounts no matter how well you're doing or how implausible the goal.
You may work with great people, but you shouldn't think anyone is your friend, no matter how much it seems like PNC is trying to encourage you to have a best friend at work.
 If you don't have a college degree and don't mind going through the monotony and company grind, there are some opportunities for advancement that may benefit you. Also, your experience may be very different depending on where you work. I visited many different branches in the central Illinois area and your daily experience is largely determined by your co-workers.

This position allowed me to combine my ability to teach with understanding finance to help people create, meet and exceed their goals.
 PNC prides itself on its core values but this is a skewed perspective.  I have found quality of life is contingent upon the mindset of the manager which determines if this core value is exercised.

"PNC Bank/Teller","This position was one which required minimal experience in the field. This was my first employment with a financial institution. There was also minimal challenge. The job was pleasant as were the customers. Any knowledge that was needed for the position was taught during training out of a training facility for PNC. Previous experience I had likely helped guide me to think this to be a very minimally challenging experience for me, as I had already dealt with customers, handled cash and processed transactions regularly. All in all this was a pleasant experience, but I preferred a bit more of a challenge which is why I resigned to focus more on obtaining my Bachelor's degree more quickly.

"High Turnover Rate","A typical day at work depends on what area you work in, In the PG county area the branch is always busy and the management was always focused on sales and what could you get from the customers they didn't care about what the customer actually needed or didn't need they just wanted us to sell. The work job life and work life balance was very uncompromising because we worked 8hrs a day Saturday through Monday and Sunday we were open for five hrs as well as certain holidays so only your vacation was a way to get away and actually enjoy some home life. There was never any job security at PNC they looked at you as a liability if you didn't earn them money or if you were costing them money and advancement was chosen by not how hard you work but the major of the advancement I've seen came by favoritism. If there is a turn around in management the job culture would be a lot better because the stress starts small but when the stress builds from the upper class management down it shows throughout the company down to the FSC so PNC as a company needs to work on their management and job culture as a whole. The compensation....WHAT the whole breakdown and system that they have is ridiculous I never was satisfied with my quarterly earnings plus it took to long to recieve such antipated income....sorry wasn't good enough for me!! The benefits well you still pay more out your pocket then what they cover so there you go!! It was a interesting experience and I met interesting people but I am blessed to have found somewhere else that cares for me and actually cares about the customer and not the - more...","Financial Services Representative","Former Employee","Hyattsville, MD","December 30, 2014","3.0"

"Going in the right direction.","I honestly can say I love my job. After doing something similar at another large bank, you can tell PNC does things a bit differently. I feel like upper management cares about me, knows my name, and treats me fairly. Everyday I'm home around 5:15 which promotes great work/life balance. I feel like I have enough time to do the work asked of me, and if I have a question I know I can reach out to quite a few people to help. 
 The ONE thing I don't like is the training. It's very minimal and inconvenient. I think I could've benefited from more training than just a week, there's a lot to learn! Other than that, PNC is a great place to work.","Teller supervisor","Current Employee","Indiana","December 24, 2014","5.0"

The management at PNC bank means well. Very well focused on how our numbers look and the money we have coming in and out of the branch. Management at PNC works hard on our team to make us the best of the best but lacks on making us feel like the best. We're always pointed out on our flaws and not so much our strong points. Working for PNC you're never going to be at the top of your game, there is always something you lack on. 
My co-workers at PNC are like a second family we are our own little team and we are always there for one another. We know when to get things done, how to and we know when we can sit back and relax because we know the job is done correctly. 
The hardest part of my career with PNC is getting recognition for the hard work you do day in and day out seven days a week. Working out every unresolved issue and problem with peoples accounts or just giving them a peace of mind on some confusion is hard work knowing everyday you walk in those doors you never know what is going to be brought to your attention or brought to the table. 
The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer walk out of those doors with a smile on their face knowing they can trust me and that they have all there finances in the right hands.

Every time and I do mean every time when the management had an opportunity to show that they believed and stood by the core principals professed by the company... like say every employee matters... they not only showed no empathy to employees but buried them under the excuse ""the companies needs"".
Also don't expect to have your ideas and attempts at collaborative teamwork and sharing to be valued. Unless sanctioned by the upper management down you are not to be a high performer as this may reflect poorly on the abilities of other longer tenured employees and in turn hurt how they look. Oh and when doing your job do not do it so well you get recognized by higher ups for your effort! If you are given a plaque, trophy, certificate to hang on the wall try and hide it don't display it even if asked to by that upper management as your tenured co-workers and direct management will begin to make your life miserable and throw you under the bus anytime possible.","Underwriter","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 16, 2014","1.0"

The compensation for the low salaries is that employees can earn bonuses on referrals. Well in the more rural areas that is virtually impossible especially when your customers have all your products. Work life balance is funny because PNC has no clue what that is. Management does not help your thrown into doing more then one job teller/financial sales consultant/branch manager job. I have even seen branch managers (my peers) doing the regional managers jobs. Job security is a joke. The upper management will lie to your face about it.

She constantly bullies her employees into thinking that she has the power to fire you at any given moment, she delegates her work out to all the employees and does basically nothing herself, if you ask her a question she gets angry at you and retaliates by giving you more work to do that she is suppose to be doing. She offers no positive feed back about the work you do only responses with negativity. Upper management has been informed of this and still nothing is done with this woman.

One of the main goals I focused on was making sure I was doing what was best for the customer and trying to help them for their future.
Management has been helpful in giving me the proper training to do my job well, but for the past year they have not really giving me the opportunity to grow. The hardest part about the job is getting cutomers to sit down and actually listen to what you have to say about helping them with their finances and them not thinking I am trying to sell them something.

 Checking the spreadsheet to see which offers are expiring on that day. Fax machine and email to see if any responses for offers come in overnight.
 Checking the previous day's work and calling the client's and money managers to get their responses for the offers that would expire on that day. Also, processing the late incoming offers. 
 Updating the clients and money manager's data base. Checking with management to make sure all offers are processed correctly. Filing all paperwork.
 I worked with a great team and I enjoyed the engagement lunches and activities and celebrating the holidays.

We had a lot of turn overs mostly because of college scheduling issues.  That made scheduling the hardest part of the job since we were shorthanded and I had to adhere to proper coverage at all times.My favorite part was going to work everyday and working with our team members but by far it was the customers.

I perform the night deposit duty as well as making a check up on the amount that is in the ATM I service. I then begin to inspect the rest of the branch in order to make sure we are ready for to open and proceed with the day. Once the branch was open i proceeded to either help the tellers process transactions at my own station or proceed with lobby engagement in helping the customers with either helping them write out deposit slips, withdrawal slips or attend any questions or concerns they may have had. I also would cross-sell products that would help improve their financial well being so that they understood everything that the bank had to offer to them so they could fully utilize all the products at their disposal. I was able to learn how to cross sell products while also servicing the customers at the best possible ability while also learning how to engage with them to open up information to helping them better bank with us. The majority of the team was brand new so management was a little lackluster but we have a great manager in our branch who is very helpful and involved in our growth. For the most part the co workers are good to work with though a much more family environment could help run the place smoother. However the most enjoyable part of the day is when we are able to relax and have fun within the bank on slow or fast days as we like to please the customers where they aren't just coming into a bank and being quickly - more...","Platform","Current Employee","Jersey City, NJ","September 22, 2014","3.0"

"Spare Yourself","I became an employee through a merger. I was with PNC for nearly two years. I have since left to pursue a more professional sales career. While employed at PNC, I was constantly moved around to cover vacancies, thus making it more difficult for me to hit my daily and quarterly goals. This was never accounted for. The pay, in comparison with other financial institutes, is pretty pathetic. With a four year degree and prior sales experience, I was paid right at $30k. (And the benefits were not good, so we used the better benefits from my husband's job.) I went through three managers during this time with about 6 months of no manager. The last manager I ended up with was so HORRIBLE that my husband was going to resign for me had I not found a MUCH better career. PNC expects its bankers to work like a horse to sell products to people who don't even need them, all while claiming to want the best for their customers.

"Advancement opportunities available","On a typical day at work, as a teller, will be processing customer's transactions, resolving customer issues and requests, and anything you cannot resolve you escalate it to the platform representatives. As a teller in PNC Bank I have learned that as long as you do your job well and right at all times and go far and beyond what is expected of you, you can advance fairly quickly within PNC as long as you have the drive and will to move forward and better yourself. Management is there to help you move forward when needed, helps you answer questions that you may have, and much more. My co-workers are the best, we work well together and get things done effectively and efficiently.  The hardest part of this job is making sure to balance to the penny at the end of the day, to make your goals on the daily basis which is 1.5% of the transactions you make a day, and to always give your 100 percent customer service to all and every client and non-client that walks through that door.

Also, the teller supervisor either ignored my questions or pretended not to hear me or was annoyed when I asked for help.  It was very confusing due to the fact that everyone that worked here had a different way of doing the job therefore I never understood what was correct and what was not.

"Terrible Management","The management would implement goals that were unrealistic due to ALWAYS being short staffed! Once, we surpassed our goal for checking accounts causing the region to exceed their goal and the regional manager said since it was student accounts it would not be profitable accounts; instead of praising us for our hard work! PNC as a company looks at each employee as a number. You are not a valued person and even when you go over and beyond sacrificing time with your family it will not be recognized or even appreciated. PNC does initially make you think your opinion counts due to employee surveys, but if you don't give your branch or manager good scores you are punished.

"PNC Bank","I worked in a lockbox at PNC. We had several daily deadlines that we tried to meet with proficiency and accuracy. I learned to see how the way I did my job affected the rest of my department.
 My co workers were efficient and I developed some valuable friendships while I worked for PNC which I will have the rest of my life.
 Hardest part of the job was when management would not allow me to stay past my shift to help the other shifts.  I know that there was a budget to be watched, but I thought getting work processed was more important because it effected the customers' finances.
 Most enjoyable part of my job was completing my work and helping the other shifts keep up with their work.
 What did I think of management?  I realize the office manager had to do what the corporate managers told them to do, but I believe corporate was too concerned with PNC's profits and not enough about meeting the customer's needs.  They seem to have forgotten that if enough customers got disgusted and left PNC, the bank would start losing business and their profits would go down.","Senior Operations Specialist","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","July 25, 2014","4.0"

I loved working in different areas of the branch and being utilized anywhere I was needed. You truly have to have a passion for customer service when working there, and of course like any other banking position, thick skin because you are working with our customers money. You need to be able to say NO or tell them why their account is over drawn, or say why their loan was not approved. PNC is known for being the most conservative banks around, but I was a very proud member of PNC and will always be thankful for my time there! I learned a great deal, and had an awesome experience.

Getting loans processed, underwritten and closed in a timely manner did not seem to be high on the priority list at PNC.
Processors would not respond to voice mails and emails for days.
Clients were left hanging with no information about the status of loans.
Loans did not close on time.
There's more, but suffice it to say that I would not recommend working at PNC for anyone who wants to be in the mortgage business long term (keeping commitments is a primary job for longevity as a loan officer and the support at PNC was almost non-existent).","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Spring, TX","July 21, 2014","1.0"

Over the course of the past decade, sales has becoming more and more aggressive to interest and convince clients that their bank is the best.  At PNC, you are the best because we tailor a conversation specific to get information form the client and have them talk about themselves.  As a Relationship Manager, we use what they told us and fit them into the correct products and solutions.  PNC is aggressive but in a different way as they show they care for the relationship over just the sale.  The sale means that person will get their Credit Card, Home Equity, Mortgage, Car loans from a different bank rather from the person from PNC who is already discussing this with the clients.

"Diverse and dynamic working environment for a developing financial company","PNC Bank is a robust and advancing competitor in the finance industry. It was recognized as an employee-centric company by many standards. However, actual workers there may believe otherwise. This fast-paced, demanding job may exhaust your quality of life (which is a key component of their core values). The benefits package appears to be substantial on paper until they're necessarily utilized. Yet, an assitance program with average resources can mainly rectify and ameliorate some of these issues.

"Great benefits, low compensation","A typical day was assisting customers, while trying to meet sales goals. Although there is a lot of talk about advancement and growth, it is pretty difficult to move from the retail side, if you find that sales is not your niche. I witnessed this with several of my co workers. The hardest part was adjusting to playing the role of a personal banker, while still being a teller, and not being compensated for the extra work, training, etc. PNC pays well if you meet sales goals, in their incentive pay...if you are not a teller. They pay $6 for each DDA acct (checking/savings) for tellers, but, pay bankers and teller supervisors more.

The management is lazy and barely ever held accountable for mistakes, slacking, ect, but they come down so hard on normal employees for absolutely anything. I've worked in both the corporate and retail sides of this company. If you're interested, I recommend corporate (customer service, collections, data entry) because the retail employees (bankers, tellers, ect) get treated with far less respect. On the corporate side there is a great sense of ""togetherness"" amongst the team, there are company picnics, sporting events, outings, volunteer opportunities, free stuff and giveaways all the time and it's just a great, fast paced environment. I had to leave because the work life balance is simply not there on the corporate side. Overall, pretty decent place to work for.

"In-Store is a Circus","If you have a college degree ( major Business/Finance/Accounting etc) the only reason you should even take this position is for the steady paycheck while you: take classes on the side and/or look for a more lucrative position.  That is unless you are one of those crazy people that enjoy retail banking.. 
 Despite what PNC preaches, the in-store positions offer limited opportunity for growth and awful hours including mandatory three weekends a month (though depending on your branch manager, that maybe flexible).  
 If PNC was the Mormon church, the in-store FSCs are the missionaries they send out on bikes to go door to door to spread the beliefs of the Mormon Church, except in store FSCs go aisle to aisle of the Giant grocery stores, marketing PNC bank.  (I could go on and on with that comparison, but I'll just leave it at that)
 The one good thing about the position, unlike most retail banks PNC sales goals are relatively low, lower bonus levels are easily obtainable (though not really lucrative) and they aren't too strict on under-performing FSCs (yet.

"PNC has a great development program and offers great opportunities for hard working individuals","A typical day at work involves supporting 5-7 Senior Bankers through prospecting, cold calls, financial modeling, and creating pitch books to increase our market position in the southeast.  Other day-to-day responsibilities include client interactions to provide products/services or solve issues, deliver Term Sheets/Commitment Letters, monitoring the deal process from execution to closing.
 I've learned that having a winning and can  do attitude is important in this business.  Being positive and open breeds success.  More importantly, that building lasting relationships with both clients and co-workers is critical. 
 Management is key to the success of the team.  However, in order for managers to be effective in their role, they need to have empowered employees who not only hold themselves accountable but also management.  The Management team that I've worked for has had a tremendous amount of industry knowledge and had a great deal of success in banking.
 Being a Senior Associate supporting several Senior Bankers ""co-workers"" is a great opportunity to learn and gain experience but also to build a personal relationship with your co-workers.  My co-workers are a thoughtful group of people who are passionate about their role, clients, and ultimately winning but also share that same sense of passion as it relates to the team setting in the office.

The people they hired in from the other banks, though, were the golden ones until they wanted to get rid of them.  There are good people that work there but they are in the branches.  The people at regional level and above are horrible.  My regional manager would berate managers on conference calls while others listened in.  The hardest part of the job was working for someone who treated people this way.  The best part was the people in the branch.

"Stable job but not a career","Overall a decent place to work.   I am speaking from a corporate function side and do notice a difference between corporate and line of business specific cultures.  Good luck trying to advance in PNC  and if you do decide to take an opportunity to work here - make sure you negotiate all you can up front cause annual increases are in the 2-3% range and the bonus plan is horrible.  All the compensation stays at the top in this enterprise and there is no motivation to do anymore than the bare minimum required by your role.    There is an upside as if you are at the end of your career or need a 9-5 job that does not require much after-hours focus due to personal/family obligations.  That said - if you are mid career - this is not the place for you as you will be held back from a development perspective.","Marketing Manager","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","March 6, 2014","3.0"

 I learned a lot from PNC actually. I never had any prior mortgage background so it taught me a lot about default, foreclosure and bankruptcy. 
 Management was pretty okay, I had an excellent manager at the time and it made working there a lot easier than most jobs I've held before. 
 My co-workers were the reason I left the company. PNC hires the most ridiculous people I've ever met. I've seen shouting matches in the middle of working, I've seen people threaten one another, physical fights almost break out, people filing complaints to HR and much more. It was probably the hardest part of the job, just dealing with them. Sometimes your hard work would go unnoticed, probably another difficult thing to deal with.

When the one branch closed and converted to our branch my Manager and Teller Supervisor was let go and that's when everything fell apart... Our branch was always a 5 star and now we are a 3 star branch. Our new Manager and Teller Supervisor have no clue how to handle a bigger branch bc they came from a small branch that was very slow and little staff. Our branch is now very unorganized and no communication within the branch, bc our Manager doesn't like to ask for help nor our Teller Supervisor.

I passed the phone interview and went to a group interview, all in the same day.  Compared to the other applicants, there were at least 10, I had more than enough experience and qualifications for the position of an entry level call center position.  I was declined a position with the generic explanation that I did not fit their needs.  I'm not sure how that could be when I have over ten years experience.  I was actually ok with the decision as I would not want to work the hours they suggested, which was 10-7 and EVERY Saturday.  They make it sound like you are eligible to change those hours after you've worked there, but we all know how that will most likely work out.  Favoritism, I'm sure is how they run this company.  The other thing that people need to be aware of is downsizing, that occurs often and employee over turn.  Why do they have so many positions open?

"Productive and fast-paced environment with strict attention to detail","A typical day at work begins with reviewing credit approvals for new and existing accounts to determine whether or not real estate is being taken as collateral. Reviewing the details of a credit approval is necessary since not all accounts and terms therein are the same. Once it is determined that real estate will be taken as collateral, then we follow certain guidelines to determine whether or not the real estate in question is located in a flood zone. If the real estate is in a flood zone, then we are required by the Federal Regulators to perform what is called flood due diligence to ensure proper flood insurance is in place before a loan can close on an account.
 My group is rather small within a larger operations group. There are about three (3) of us along with our direct manager. We work well together and learn from one another in order to get the job done. Performing flood due diligence can be difficult at times, depending on how many properties are located in flood zones. Every account brings its own ""personality"" if you will, to the table. Some are very simple and some require more attention. All in all, it is very interesting work and I learn something new everyday that keeps me on my toes.
 Aside from flood due diligence, I am also in charge of six (6) regions whereby I work closely with the relationship managers and the attorneys on different accounts to resolve legal exceptions. Legal exceptions are created after closing documents are received and reviewed to ascertain what is missing from the loan documents or if any deficiencies exist within the loan documents. - more...","Legal Documentation","Current Employee","East Brunswick, NJ","January 9, 2014","4.0"

Once you get your experience though get the heck out!  Their training is horrendous, all they care about are SALES #'s.  They didn't care that I had a customer service score of 4.98/5.00 (yes, Gallup the company that conducts polling will randomly call your customers to ascertain satisfaction.)  All I heard after carrying such a high service score was I was doing a bad job and all this other BS just because my sales numbers were middle of the pack.  My biggest gripe with this company is the pay, it is PATHETIC!!!.  My annual raise was .15 cents an hour.  I started making 11.50 / hr, after my ""Big"" promotion I was making 12.50 /hr.  The majority of the customers that you will see on a given day will be very escalated due to poor company training and no accountability.  So your day basically consists of putting out fires other people started.  Customer Service incentives were easy to hit however the sales goals were nearly impossible.  Management wants you to be a robot for the company and never question processes that are made by people who haven't been in a retail branch in 10 years.

With managing I have also learned how to understand co-workers personalities and how to approach co-workers the right way to get the task done right the first time. The hardest part of my job is making cold calls for sales opportunities. I would much rather pitch a product that I believe would truly help my clients financial well-being, rather than just pushing any product.

"Loan Officers Not Respected","PNC has a great reputation for Financial Services and Banking, mortgages, not so much.  In Southern California, they are known for causing problems for Short Sellers and their realtors, by holding out for more money in a 2nd lien position, and settling with regulators for large amounts of money for mortgage related infractions.  But this is all stuff that you're able to overcome with strong relationships.
 What you can't overcome is upper management's refusal to hire more fulfillment staff.  LO's make too much money anyway, right?  They can also process their own loans.  Recently they unveiled a new fulfillment process that would set everything strait.  Basically it amounted to the LO submitting a loan package that had everything short of transcripts.  It is a 90+ point check list of documents needed to get your file to underwriting.  The files went straight to UW, the processors didn't get involved until later.  I still don't quite understand what the few processors they do have actually do.  They didn't pull together outstanding paperwork, collect info to satisfy conditions, or anything you would expect a processor to do.  That being said, there were a few goods ones I enjoyed working with except it was rare that they would be assigned to my files, the good processors were assigned to the LOs who submitted incomplete files.....
 The corporate side of the company is horrible.  The culture you find when dealing with HR, Payroll, etc. is a finger pointing, ""That's not my job"", can't do attitude.

I enjoy my co-workers we work as a family instead of a team, we help one another, we can also make the day go by fast just for the little things that we do to encourage the other person.  The hardest thing about my job I think is when you work for a big branch, you lose some of the personal connection with your customers, and sometimes that is difficult, most customers want that personal one on one, and in my position as a teller you have to look at everything and sometimes not that you want that but it gets lost because you are trying to help and get your customers in and out in a reasonable time.

I love being busy and learning daily.  That takes me to what I have learned about myself as an individual and an employee.
 I am very proactive and take initiative.  I learned that I am one to pass the buck.  The buck stops with me, if it gets to me.  I am not afraid to admit when I am not familiar with anything because I know that the opportunity is there to learn and grow and I am willing to seize it.
 Management has to be approached on a person by person basis.  It all boils down to personalities and how everybody meshes together.  It is all about setting the expectations, boundaries.  Based on my observation, management style in general is top down, but may not work for everybody.
 My co-workers for the most part are great to work with.  We all are working towards the same goal personally and professionally.  We have adapted the company's culture.

"Tellers are a ""dime a dozen.""","Highly stressful based on customer interaction, we must adhere to banking rules and often have to repeat the same thing to a customer. Working with large amounts of cash can be very stressful when out of balance. 
 I learned how to sell. This job was 90% sales 10% banking in terms of cashing checks and making deposits for customers.
 Management was very strict, often would talk on a weekly basis about sales levels and areas of self improvement. 
 Co-workers were all fairly young, willing to learn, but most of all, they needed to sell products as well in order to be recognized.
 The hardest part of my job was learning how to be assertive to customers who were shallow. I've had several instances in which I denied a customer funds from a check because of an expired drivers license and gotten called everything but my name.
 I was able to develop a system of which to talk to certain people.

As a Processing Improvement Analyst, I did daily audit on production, co-workers or new processes.Our team was in charge of finding, correcting and attempting to eliminate errors for our department. I was completely in charge of a new process from beginning to end. Unfortunately the company decided not to proceed due to cost. I had many friends in management and on the processing floor. The hardest part of my job is due to my lack of education I struggled with some areas of my job, because I do not have the knowledge in computers that I would like to have. What I liked about my job is that even though there were certain things I did every day. There was always a new work experience around the corner.

What is upper managment thinking in their hiring decisions for managers. So much talent exists within the team that their hiring decision could have made so much more sense by promoting from within. Team members are beginning to look elsewhere for opportunites outside of the company due their less than acceptable practices. To boot, salaries and compensation in at least the sales division is one of the poorest ever experienced. Big Box store greeters are being equally compensated or more than our sales consultants who hold great responsibility and are responsible for making the company money! Those billion dollar quarters are not possible without the main revenue producing division: SALES...Not sure if ever the company will take a step back and realize where their priorities need to be vs. where they are.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 22, 2013","1.0"

"WorkLife at PNC Bank","Working for PNC Bank was a really different experience from the 17+ years I spent working for another major financial institution in Chicago. My typical day ran smoothly with all tellers aboard for our morning meetings as we took pre-lobby drive up customers. At 9am, the doors opened and off we went. I learned a lot about the diferent businesses and their needs in the neighborhood as well as the many walk in customers from the surrounding blocks near the branch. Most notably, Brookfield, Illinois. My manager was very hands on in his day to day coaching of me and my staff, to help exhibit 5 Star customer service every day to every customer. Very nurturing when it came to outside work needs, such as family leave. My staff I  managed were well groomed in customer service at this branch, since most of them were in place at this location from the 2 banks before PNC. The hardest part of my actual job was trying to cross sell more new products to the retired and ""older money"" that was already well established in the branch as well as the neighborhood or 40-50 years. The most enjoyable part of my job was on Saturdays when everyone was in for a shorter day and the vibe in the branch from everyone made us feel like we had done a great job pulling together through the past week and now it was the weekend.

"Appearances were deceiving","Days began with a motivating morning meeting filled with statistics and a focus for the day. There were both peak times and down time during the day. I utilized down time by ordering supplies, settling an ATM, reorganizing my drawer, or taking various computerized trainings and tests available on PNC University. I enhanced my skills in efficiency and customer service in this position, developed relationships with clients, learned and sold a product line, and gained experience in operating various machines. 
 Management was initially supportive and encouraging, but became distant as new employees, including myself, became self sufficient. Morning meeting began to focus on information beyond the scope of tellers responsibilities. Feedback and monthly coaching/reviews were set on the back burner and came weeks or even months late. The teller line became discouraged and morale went way down. 
 The hardest part of the job eventually became having a positive attitude and a drive and desire to go to work. The product line began to change and low income customers or customers who didn't use PNC as their primary bank were starting to be weaned out of their accounts by increased fees. The managerial training approach to having these conversations with these customers was callous and unsympathetic. My work/life balance became disturbed.

"Quickstart and Goal Setting","A day at work would always start with a Quick Start. Quick Start is a 10-15 minute pep rally. I would huddle with the team to set individual goals on activities for the day and set the stage. Motivate the team to reach their goals and set the tone of the day. 
I would then meet with my Financial Sales Consultant and talk about how her previous day went. Ask her question around what she felt she did good and what she found that may have hinder her from selling a product or having a complete conversation with a customer.  I would role play with what hinder her from having the conversation with the customer, so she would feel comfortable with the next customer. She would set a goal for herself on the activities she was going to work on for the day.  Then I would end our daily debrief with praising her on what she accomplished. I feel it's always best to end with a positive note.
The hardest part of my job is when I can't provide for my customer. For example, when they are trying to better themselves and they would like to consolidate loans and it's declined. I give them advice and show them how they can build their credit. At the same time I know I did all that I could but the expression on their face is so hard to look at. On the other side, when I am able to provide for a customer who is purchasing their first car or home and the joy in their face is the most enjoyable part of my day. It also brings me joy when my team succeeds in meeting our goal in sales and customer service Gallup survey.

I have learned a lot about the banking industry during my time with PNC. Both within my area and across different departments. I would say the most enjoyable portion of working with the customers is helping to find products that best fit their individual needs and then making certain they understand any pitfalls or potential nuances they may encounter. On the other hand, not all customers choose to follow the right path and sometimes get into products or services that do no best represent their needs and can cause high levels of frustration for our clients.

You're not supposed to have extensive conversations with your coworkers, if any at all. You have to keep track of every little thing that you do in a ""productivity database."" People tell on each other, instead of resolving issues with themselves. Team leads (one in particular) thinks she's the ""punisher"", and enjoys bossing people around and reporting them for petty occurrences. 
 Everyone seems to be getting more miserable by the day. We have cake days for birthdays each month and food days, where we stuff ourselves with carbohydrates. People need to move around more. No wonder everyone is over-weight and unhappy.
 The pay is horrible. Having acquired National City and Royal Bank of Canada, PNC's compensation and bonuses have slumped significantly from what I've been told. You only get 6 occasional absence days in addition to your vacation time and holidays. So whether you are sick and/or have a doctor's appointment or there is a death in the family or you have an interview, that's it for the year. And you can bet that if you want to use vacation time, you're going to get hassled for it. You may have a higher education than your manager's manager, you won't be compensated for it.

Thinking back to when I started, there were so many people who gave their time and energy to help make me the employee I am today.

My work days for the most part were enjoyable and some of the customers made the day go faster. Management has changed since I first started, but originally, management was awesome!

"PNC In-Store Bank","I worked in PNC Bank's InStore channel for several years.  It is a great entry level experience for anyone looking to start a career in banking. The primary role of an In-Store banker is to prospect for clients inside of Giant Supermarkets with the purpose of recommending various products and services including accounts, investments, and credit instruments. There are very aggressive sales goals which can be stressful at times but the company does provide you with tools to get the job done. The position does require you work long non-conventional bank hours as the branches are open 7 day per week 364 days per year. There are strong advancement opportunities for those that excel in their roles.

I left the company after several other employees left PNC due to the management at the branch. Before I left I was doing teller work, teller supervisor work, and banker responsiblies. I worked six days a week and hardly got a day off. I would not recommend working with this company. You have to be friends with the manager! If she does not like you she will find a way to get rid of you. No one should be treated that way. I called our customer relations hotline several times and nothing was done.

"Very poor Wealth Management offering","PNC Wealth Management is by far, the must unhealthy and unprofessional work environment I have been involved in during my 10+ year career. The environment is not only chaotic and driven by drama but it is all filled with gossip obsessed, immature individuals who operate with what they believe is a 'cut-throat' mentality but in actuality it is childlike behavior that leads to poor results, lack of production and failed business plans. There is no sense of direction given from upper management which leads to a free for all and a scramble for answers any time an issue arises. The only way to get ahead is to ""yes"" the under qualified senior management to death. There is a lack of quality employees and work produced which is evident by the fact that clients pull their money out of the bank quite frequently. Management hires with an outsourcing-type mentality- they only hire cheap labor, with a lack of ability in order to give the appearance that the job is getting done. Once the employees catch on to this cyclical pattern they move on or are replaced immediately. There is no room to develop your skills, perfect your art and truly produce quality work because at PNC Wealth Management, they are only concerned with 'putting a bandage over the wound' rather than actually healing it. Appearing to produce results is far more important than actually producing results. I would not recommend working here to anyone with an interest in longevity or the ambition to succeed in the Wealth Management business.","Wealth Management Advisor","Current Employee","New Jersey","February 14, 2013","1.0"

I remember walking into work and getting told everyday how you can lose your job. Growth opportunity was very weak.. All I can do is laugh about advancement and the first word that comes to mind is ***Cheap. You hear about the bank making billions, but when it comes to job opportunity there is no agreement. If anything they will try to pay the same pay rate but with more hours and say at least you have benefits. Then smile on in your face.-Management : I believe this category can be different in any company. In my example my teller supervisor was great. However, the branch manager was just .... BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Not only did my manager didn't care about us she will talk trash behind our backs. What made my moment bad when I was told that I should be happy to even have a job because people with more education and experience will die for my job. People will die for 15k a year.-Work / Life Balance : working wasn't the problem I did my job very well. If anything I was trusted to do things a supervisor will do. Life balance was not good.

I was assigned to assist in the transition of one business unit and its ultimate liquidation, and quickly relegated to handling a small task that I had previously delegated to other paralegals and support staff.My direct manager was thoughtful and genuinely concerned with assuring an orderly transition of my responsibilities to other lawyers in his team and the orderly wind-down of my personal involvement. My co-workers in the law department were great resources and helped me integrate into their culture.The most difficult part of the job was participating in the liquidation of a business unit where I had worked for 14 years, and the elimination of the jobs for more than 100 of my former co-workers. Also, it was difficult to tell co-workers to refer their questions to others who had assumed my roles when I otherwise would have been capable of immediately answering their questions. Maintaining a positive attitude while under a 6-month transition period was more that difficult, and without the support of the PNC transition team responsible for the orderly liquidation of the business unit, would have been impossible. PNC is very structured and fractured in its management and business operations, which leads to significant levels of dysfunction, confusion, and lack of accountability.

"Good starting out job","Overall the job is good. The pay is excellent for part-time. This job relies heavily on everyone doing their part because team work is the heart of the bank. The job is the same every day. You do the exact thing over and over, with very little variety. There are chances to be promoted and it's encouraged to seek out those opportunities. The downside is the heavy reliance on teamwork. In order to do your job the very best everyone else must do their jobs their very best. If someone isn't there or isn't performing as a team member you all suffer. Even with the monthly performance reviews it's difficult to understand what the expectations are and how you are measuring up. Sometimes it seems like the rules change from day to day. While working here I have learned a lot about personal responsibility and ownership of my job. I have also learned to just let things 'roll off.' This job is simple enough, but has a lot of procedure and rules. You have to be patient with yourself as you learn all the rules, regulations and procedures.

There was a good mix of government employees and locals. One thing I learned is that residents of lower to moderate income level neighborhoods do not expect much from the professionals that work in their neighborhoods. In the beginning of my career at King Avenue, many people were skeptical of my intentions, particularly the amount of time I planned to remain at that branch. Many of the previous managers tenure lasted less than six months.

"The company itself has great standards","I was hired as a LFSC which is just a fancy way of saying a licensed personal banker. My time was supposed to be 60% retail banking and 20% investments. My branches assigned Financial Advisor viewed me as his personal secretary/assistant even though he was supposed to be mentoring and grooming me to become a financial advisor. After sitting in four of his appointments I soon realized he had no idea what he was talking about and often made up his background and history in the financial world to set clients at ease. My manager and my Financial Advisor would get into arguments about who was ""truly in charge of me"" and it quickly felt like I was a number and not a valued employee. Of course it would of helped if there was a clear definitive job description out there for my position from the bank, there wasn't. The job description was very vague and was left open to interpretation by management. Management was very much the byproduct of a previous acquisition of a prior bank. Some management from TWO acquisitions ago. Bottom line those banks got bought out for a reason and a lot of the prior management lack the customer service and sales balance that the company so rightfully has earned in prior awards and review. The company itself is OUTSTANDING but it's employee base needs to be reviewed and weeded out. All the way through to HR. One representative in particular.

"Take it from me: not as advertised","PNC may be named ""One of the 100 Best Places to Work"" by major ratings and magazines, but ask most fellow employees, at least in Florida, and you will get an argument. This bank runs their Investments business model as a singular, centralized monolith. Florida's demographics and overall investment market creates a much, much different proposition than Pittsburgh, Cleveland, or many of the other major cities up north where PNC is arguably one of the dominant forces. Their managed money model may work well for them with the emerging affluent markets in those cities, but it ignores a huge opportunity with the senior citizens that dominate down in Florida who could care less about anyone charging them a fee to babysit their accumulated assets. Simply put; their model doesn't fit FL - a fact that falls on deaf ears with Senior Management at HQ back in PA, and that's why PNC cannot keep good people but instead keeps turning over their Advisors and their Management Team in the Sunshine State.","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Orlando, FL","July 29, 2012","2.0"

"A potentially great company that has grown too quickly to keep up with the big banks and still relies on its antiquated infrastructure and management.","I was originally very excited at the opportunity at PNC. It took quite a while to be onboarded into the company and even longer (6 month) to be assigned my book of business. My team helped me along more than my manager and they are truly the only redeeming quality at PNC. I began really working my book in January and we were told an incentive/structure change would be taking place shortly. It didn't happen until March and completely flipped the way we were incentivized upside down. The most frustrating thing is over a half a year later they still don't have the reporting necessary for us to do our job based on all of the changes they made for 2012. I could go on and on about our systems and all of their issues but I do love helping my clients and making a difference. I have been recognized as a top performer so even though I still don't know where I stand I have been told that I am doing the right thing and doing it well. As far as the company they do things to make you feel proud at times. Their ""Grow Up Great' commitment is wonderful and they really do put thought and innovation into their retail product line. But then the branch systems are prehistoric and nothing is in real time. The branch positions are too closely layered to make sense to the employees let alone the customers.

I had been told by customers, different sections of management and former co workers, that there was a VERY high amount of turn over. And there is.Management in this company varies. Upper level management is cordial, but they are running a business of numbers. Branch-level management is tricky-hidden agendas are prevalent, petty egos, not all of the managers in charge are qualified, some of them should have retired when the love went out of the job. Applicant beware if you like your 40 hours drama free.I won't go into details about my personal experience, but my manager looked the other way for customers on many occasions, including when they were ABUSIVE to the staff and was VERY bias about refunding fees.

I was told I would be able to go back if I improved, however I was never given the coaching time needed to improve my skill set. They don't care about their employees.

"back up head teller full time teller","Customers were somewhat pleasent got to know many new people learned alot used it to my advantage but as far as working for pnc, horrible management does not listen to their employees about customer service who handles customers day in and out, they dont understand what the customers really want they go by a gallup to review their employees which is silly they basic the entire branch off of a gallup instead of hard work and customer achievement and word of mouth, always works short staff go through managers like you go through socks, the pay is horrible, they dont treat their employees with respect, management makes the job more stressful the it is, most enjoyable part of job is some of the co workers you grow to care, and everyday customers but pnc really needs to get it together starting with how they treat their employees, so if your looking for just a job with some what ok hours not to good of pay just to kinda of get you by pnc is your job but i would not go full time the job and pay is not worth it part time is ideal for this job. Also they give new rules almost everyday and the head teller and managers change them when they want or use the ones that benefit them as need. And again the pay is a joke. And minorities get less money go figure horrible job. just ask any teller oh yea wanting you to stay later because they are short staffed but then asking you to cut your time because they allow no over crazy want to take your time away from your life and family but dont want to pay you for it cheap cheap cheap, only keep there part timer at 26 hours, no matter if they are - more...","backup head teller full time teller","Former Employee","delaware","June 11, 2012","1.0"

A checking account is a checking account, however the ability to offer sound advice and build relationships with my clients that demonstrated a genuine commitment to helping them grow and prosper...this is what PNC business banking was about form my perspective. My manager worked diligently to give me the tools to be successful, particularly around credit analysis.

There is alot of poor communication within the company about job responsibilities and it is not a very consistant work enviroment. The enviroment is sales and it can be cut throat.

Its sad because legacy National City employees really loved the old company and also legacy PNC employees would agree that it was a better place to work before the merger. I think they really just got to big to fast and management is not able to grasp it.","Licensed Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Central Ohio","April 14, 2012","1.0"

"Not a very good job","PNC has a very cusotmer service centered culture. I work in the sales area of one of there call cneters and hate it. they have no sales focus at all even my incentive as a sales rep is partly based on customer service. they also pay quaterly incentive at very low rate.

"Not the greatest!","I loved my job far better when it was National City. I am so happy I am not there anymore. I put in ten years there and got nothing in return. It seems that once PNC took over, things got really bad. They are or seem to be ""weeding out"" former National City employees so that they can start over with newer (and cheaper) help. Management at the branch level was not understanding AT ALL!!! Co-workers were very nice, friendly, helpful and understanding. I remember one time when the power was out and the managers, including the regional manager, made us all stand outside in 100 degree temps..One person ended up getting sick and I personally get heat stroke..to them it didn't matter..They said to go outside to talk to people and let them know there was no power and that we were closed!
