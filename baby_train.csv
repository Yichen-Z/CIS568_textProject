"Good work life balance, but lower than average compensation","Work assignments are challenging and the organization as a whole shifted focus to advancing technology. Employees who perform and earn high ratings do have opportunities to advance depending on the role. Company is flexible with remote work and time off benefits are good. Negative would be that job titles and roles often can be misleading. In many instances business analysts work as certified scrum product owners but do not receive compensation of that role. Analysts are often expected to do the work of both roles, acting as product owner and analyst on Agile development crew. Organization seems to favor compensating employees who leave and return vs. retaining / rewarding performers.","Business Analysis Consultant Sr - IT","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 24, 2022","3.0"
"Not a very stable place at the moment","this bank overall was not that bad to work for however, they are doing away with allot of positions and they are making allot of branches cashless. If you are a banker you will be fine but I would not waste my time being a teller. They have said within 5 years over 45% of tellers will be gone. They are doing away with positions and putting the extra work on others without any extra compensation. I woukd not go back.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Bristol, PA","October 23, 2022","4.0"
"Good Place to Work","this bank was a good place to work at. They had great benefits, great co-workers, tuition reimbursement, and good management. The only downfall was room to grow.","Mortgage Loan Processor III","Former Employee","Downers Grove Illinois","October 22, 2022","4.0"
"4 stars","What is the best part of working at the company? They have decent benefits and seem to have a healthy and supportive work environment. Management makes it a point to include riddles during meetings and provide free snack stations in every department that are always stock with candy, chips etc . & What is the most stressful part about working at the company? for me it was the shift, overnight 10pm-6:30am, along wit car issues that did me in and ended my employment. Sleeping during the day was difficult as well. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Positive and supportive for the most part What is a typical day like for you at the company? punch in, put on my headphones and start prepping my station for the client I have that day.","Lockbox Processor","Former Employee","Mount Laurel, NJ","October 22, 2022","4.0"
