5550,"Midwestern Bank with Midwest attitude","Accountability and responsibility are passed from one person to the next making it hard to achieve. Even when working on a common project, team members refuse to provide valued information and contribute to success. Mediocrity is valued and is evident by the praise employees get when staying in the same role from year after year causing stagnation, but management does not see it that way. If you wish to excel and achieve look elsewhere. Slow and steady and a mediocre output will get you a promotion.","Recruiter II","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 21, 2014","3.0"

5558,"A great place to learn and grow","I enjoy working for this bank but it is not where I see myself in 10 years. A typical day at work would involve helping customer make deposit, withdrawls, etc. from their accounts. Also, meeting daily goals like opening new checking accounts and generating new leads for loans and investments. One of the main goals I focused on was making sure I was doing what was best for the customer and trying to help them for their future. Management has been helpful in giving me the proper training to do my job well, but for the past year they have not really giving me the opportunity to grow. The hardest part about the job is getting cutomers to sit down and actually listen to what you have to say about helping them with their finances and them not thinking I am trying to sell them something. What I like about my job is the fact that I get to watch my customer make better financial situation and I know will secure them a better future.","Customer Service Associate","Current Employee","Valley Park, MO","October 18, 2014","4.0"

Checking my email to see what new offers needed to be processed (emailing, faxing, or mailing offer notices) and the email is checked periodically throughout the day for incoming offers and they were entered immediately into the daily excel spreadsheet. Checking the spreadsheet to see which offers are expiring on that day. Fax machine and email to see if any responses for offers come in overnight. Checking the previous day's work and calling the client's and money managers to get their responses for the offers that would expire on that day. Also, processing the late incoming offers Updating the clients and money manager's data base. Checking with management to make sure all offers are processed correctly. Filing all paperwork. I worked with a great team and I enjoyed the engagement lunches and activities and celebrating the holidays. I would say the hardest part of the job was processing and getting all the responses for a huge offer that had several hundred client's and money managers in time for the expiration date.","Corporate Actions Solicitations Specialist","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA","October 15, 2014","4.0"

If you want to be a suck up to people who don't appreciate the quality of worker you are then this is the perfect job for you. Teller manager will always be on your back and tell you what you're doing wrong, there's always going to be a sense of favoritism working for a bank. The clients aren't the problem, the problem is internal. Manager can be irresponsible and throw away employees, there is not enough appreciation for employees you will do favors and not get any favors done for you. The most enjoyable part of this job is when you think you're doing everything you're supposed to, up until someone of higher power has an unnecessary biased opinion about your work.","Teller","Former Employee","West Palm Beach, FL","October 14, 2014","3.0"

I would have passed up on this bank Mortgage, if I knew that they didn't care about your work/life balance. There are no goal-oriented goals to achieve in department and you will be worked endlessly to whatever management tells you to do, if you don't bend to them, they will find a temp or someone who for cheaper would do so.
