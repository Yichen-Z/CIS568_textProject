The benefits are great as well. When I worked there, the pay was significantly less than other banks, but I hear that is currently being changed. I loved this bank, and in a year and a half I moved from part time teller, to full time, and eventually Teller Supervisor. I ended up leaving because we received a new branch manager who was very antagonistic and incompetent. Corporate was very unreceptive and dismissive, and after enough abuse I left.
