One hour lunch is always a plus however is not paid for(not that I expect it to be). Paid holidays and sick days. The only thing is that working here is not compatible with someone living on their own especially supporting children. The company expects to receive more than what they put out. If you want your employees to be the best you need to have something to put out, to motivate them. Health benefits are ridiculous, very expensive. There is no room for advancement and if there is any it is extremely hard to reach. They tend to hire from outside rather than promote from within.
