Those are where you work as a teller and platform but get paid less than a platform in a traditional branch. You also work 11-7 weekdays as well as Sundays which stinks. The benefits are great I must say and training was very informative. But another con is feeling like product pushers when the company says that isn't what they are about.

Hourly pay was okay, but once commissions changed it was a lot harder to make the same amount as before. Customers can get pretty upset over the phone (which can be understandable), however I was taught on what to say and how to approach calls differently.
