4261,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone","The benefits seem great at first. Until you take vacation they told you was available for use and you quit then you have to pay that all back. Why make that time available? this bank doesn't care about their employees as they don't compensate for the work that's expected. Additionally it's difficult to advance, it doesn't matter if you're the top performer management seems to find a reason to decline a promotion. Management is picky in who they hire, so it takes MONTHS to fill a position, only for a short time later that position to be vacant again (there seems to be a high turnover percentage). Branches are always short staffed which makes it difficult for the employees working because even more work gets put on them. However, I will say the most enjoyable part were the co-workers and the hours. I wouldn't recommend this as a place of employment to a place to bank to anyone.","Teller","Former Employee","Erie, PA","September 29, 2016","1.0"

4270,"High turnover for good reasons","The job itself was great; I felt productive every day and was challenged to learn more about my role without feeling overwhelmed. However, the manager and supervisor would make last-minute changes to the schedule, changed their mind at the last minute about giving days off that were agreed upon months ago, and often would not adhere to important policies for the sake of convenience. I was with the company for a very short time and saw so many employees come and go during my time there because they were not willing to do anything for the employees.","Teller","Former Employee","Severna Park, MD","September 23, 2016","3.0"

I did like my management and co-workers as I am still in contact with most of them even after I quit. They became more than just my co-workers, they became dear friends as well. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was trying to get referrals in the drive thru because usually people were in a hurry to get in, get out, and get done. I was able to get some customers to upgrade accounts or get new ones once in a while but when they wanted to get done so quickly, it did make it a little more difficult.
