At the height of the COVID19 outbreak I found myself terminated for a procedural violation, well over a month from the occurrence.

" this bank is always trying to feed you","A Typical day at this bank includes being on the phones all day with your two standard 15 min brakes and one 30 min lunch which fly by. Time moves so slowly when your on the floor, your on the phone taking about 150 phone calls per day. I learned a tons there your in training every other month its a lot to take in at times but you get through it. the management is horrible there's never anyone around when you really need help and they have no issue throwing you under the bus to save their behind after they told you to do something. (always record your conversations while with management so you don't lose your job seen countless people fired for things they were told to do by management) The workplace culture itself is pretty good when your dealing with other employees someone is always trying to feed you. the hardest part of the job would be taking the back to back calls and getting yelled at by customer's and trying to keep good quality scores which is hard to do because your graded on the call you took even if its a ball call, if you don't have thick skin this is not the job for you.

"100% Micromanaged","I've been at this bank for about 3 months and not a day goes by without me thinking if I want to come to work or call out. The system that this bank has is extremely outdated; to get a statement, you would have to go to 3 systems to get there. Not only is the system outdated but so is the building and furniture. Everything that you do here is micromanaged. With every customer, you have to write down their name and account number for a daily debrief where management would go over that and see where you had missed opportunities to make sales. You always have to click the insights whenever a customer is in front of you, if not, they get mad. They want to know why you wouldn't sell a 96 year old man a credit card. There's also cold calls you have to do. Upper management expect you to make 100 dials a week and have at least 2 appointments daily. If it's a holiday or you were sick, you have to make up those dials when you come back. They worry more about the dials than customer service. The training is horrible. They throw you into a pack of wolves with no protection. You learn while being on the job. Branch support will be your best friend because no one will help you. They also expect you to know everything about banking so you're able to deliver the insights. They would tell you to bring someone more seasoned into the conversations, but when you do, no one will reach out and you're made a fool out of yourself. Sales goals is ridiculous. You would have think after the Wells Fargo controversy, this bank would cut down on the aggression of sales.

"good but stressful","I enjoyed working at this bank but was taking the stress and anxiety of the job home with me and it was affecting my home life.

"Comfortable company to settle down in"," this bank prioritizes work-life balance in many (but not all) of its lines of business. Working in treasury management, employees typically are in the office 40 hours / week with the flexibility to work from home as needed. Projects are interesting and expansive as the company is a full service bank. Advancement occurs fluidly but salary often doesn't follow as quickly.

"Run from them","This place is a joke. I've worked here for 15 years. Hard working loyal employee. I'm now actively looking for another job, should have done it years ago but I kept expecting them to figure it out and do the right thing. They literally give you a pay decrease after factoring in inflation year on year even with exceeds expectations or better and sometimes none at all. Their managers are told to average out 1 to 2 percent increases for everyone and will move you and your managers evaluation of you lower to fit that (not just in pay but performance). They do nothing for the good of the employee beyond what they are guilted into via industry pressures or PR. The decisions they make are short sighted. HR and incompetency has convinced them they don't need to actually pay employees. 1+ BILLION in pure profit a quarter (that's 4 times a year) for over a decade in a row and they don't pay their employees at all. It's astounding and incredible to me this is allowed to occur. It's unethical, immoral, and corrupt. I don't say these things lightly. It hurts. I've worked there for a long time.

"Decent company if you get into the right department","Plenty of office politics, great opportunities, but there are potential land mines to navigate that can derail a career. Fall into the wrong project and you can be sidelined. They are the big fish in the market, so that makes it hard to negotiate salary once you're hired. So negotiate upfront and be prepared to live with that decision. Good benefits, decent enough work/life balance for some, lots of overtime for others. For this I'd give it a mixed review.

I tried but no growth.","Banker","Former Employee","Chicago land area","January 30, 2020","1.0"
"Poor Management","Management does not appear to respect employees from the beginning: many interviews, sometimes no communication afterward, no return phone calls after demanding time prior to hiring; the largest concern is sales and what the employee can do for the company rather than ensuring the company also fits into some of the employee's needs for better morale. It's hypocritical to ask that customer facing employees perform perfectly while hiring managers and branch managers have little to no people or communication skills, lack of etiquette, and lack of basic courtesy. Not everyone that applies to this bank carries a nothing more than a high school diploma and there are people in the workforce who would like to be treated with some form of dignity. If you live in Southern Maryland and you would like to be treated fairly and with respect, look and apply elsewhere.

Their main response was 'what can I do to help you get more customers?'

"Good place to start a career for the most part","Overall this is a great job to grow with. I would recommend going in as a plat form member though. Being a teller means you have the most transaction in the bank. Meaning they constantly set high goals for you to reach.which wouldn't be bad, but they keep making it harder to hit the incentive goal. meaning you don't get the incentive pay. Since i started they have taken 3 things away that would've been a referral for us. meaning now its even hard to hit the goal. also when you are hired on, they say it isn't a sales job, but it really is. They want us to push credit card offers, and that's fine and all, but asking the same person more than once is rude. especially when its not in the customers best interest all the time. We also don't get a lot of new customers in the branch. most of them are older, or have some debt. Generally those customers do not want a new credit card. But we are told to ask and make sure they leave with a hand out. even if you hit your referral goals, its never good enough..","Teller","Current Employee","Springfield, OH","January 28, 2020","4.0"
"Good benefits, mediocre compensation, difficult to advance to upper management"," this bank in my opinion is a good starting ground. Advancing in lower positions is very achievable, but advancing to upper management is impossible... The pay is okay, not the highest, but still better than most. Incentive plan is mediocre, unless in a very high traffic/ high net worth area. Benefits like healthcare and vacation are very good. Work culture is inviting, but certain policies in place allow for employees to slack and really not get punished (my own branch experiences).","Branch Sales and Service Associate I","Current Employee","Vero Beach, FL","January 27, 2020","3.0"

Upper management doesn't care about employees career path all they want to make sure you are getting Credit Card applications on a daily basis and investment referrals.It is all about what this bank can get. this bank make it seem better than what it is.

Be aware that if you work for this region your personal life will be expected to put on second, business is always first. Vacation time will be approved if and only Reginal Manager approves it.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Fayetteville, NC","January 16, 2020","1.0"
"you cannot trust anyone","I worked for this bank for 5 years. The regional manager made everyone miserable. If she did not like you you were marked to get fired. I was harassed. Eventually, the manager asked me to input a clients ID to issue new debit card even though the client did not have his ID with him, because we 'KNEW' him as a customer. I was reluctant but at the managers insistence issued him a new debit card anyway. Of course I was then fired. WHAT A JOKE AND WASTE OF 5 YEARS.","Licensed banker II","Former Employee","Lambertville, NJ","January 16, 2020","1.0"
" this bank is. GREAT company to work for."," this bank is a Great Company to work for, but the upper management with the Atlanta base lockbox leaves the site open to untrustworthy managers. You then lose good employees and bad moral becomes an everyday reminder. Your team feels this is just a job and are afraid to speak up.","Supervisor","Former Employee","College Park, GA","January 16, 2020","4.0"
"Pretty decent","It was a pretty decent job just make sure you stay on your P's and Q's very strict they will terminate you without question The calls were back to back your basically busy 24/7 needed more down time not enough breaks","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Columbia, SC","January 16, 2020","3.0"

"Avoid This Position","The people in this position are horrible.. They tell you are able to ask questions if you need help and then when you do you are told by the manager that the people don't know your job because they are separate divisions within this job. The manager and team lead are just wishy washy and backstabbing people!","Image Specialist","Former Employee","Cleveland, OH","January 15, 2020","1.0"
"Stressful","As a customer service rep, you take an average of 50 70+ calls per day. The calls are back to back with little to no down time. You do have managers and supervisor with you during every shift, but at times it can be difficult to get a hold of one of them to assist with you during your call. You are rated and scored with each call that can make assisting customers somewhat stressful, because they don't want you on each call too long but what the customers needs met. It is a very stressful balancing act with each situation. There is on going training and team meetings that you need to attend. The team meetings are not long enough to cover all the questions that other team members may have for clarification to assist customer efficiently.","Support Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 14, 2020","2.0"

"Overall","Overall this bank is an awesome company and cares genuinely about the employees. The managers are HORRIBLE . And not just one or two I have networked with a lot of different branch managers and have seen how different managers manage there teams. They are NOT team players AT all. They only care about themselves and their results and they expect you to do your job and theirs. this bank have different opportunities as far as promotion and advancement but manager are envious of employees that excel better than them.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Illinois","January 14, 2020","3.0"
"Horrible place to work!","Exempt employees are expected to work 50-60+ hours per week because hourly employees cannot. Senior management at Brecksville/Pittsburgh Lending facility is inexperienced and/or unconcerned with customers or employees.","AVP of Operations","Former Employee","Brecksville, OH","January 14, 2020","1.0"
"Corporate bullish!$","The higher ups at this bank only care about customer satisfaction, and making money. They say they are not like other big banks but that is not true. High pay isn't worth it. Taking a pay cut to seek other employment. There are surveys that go out to customers, that can make or break your bonuses. There's been times we've received bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry they can't get their way, and it's tanked our bonuses that we received and earned. They want you to kiss every customers butt and they do it at the expense of their employees. The pay is great but that's the only thing and they use that as means to secure you in the job.","Services Representative","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 14, 2020","1.0"

"Very good place","The managers really cared about your growth and are always willing to lend a hand. They pay is kind of low for the work being done, but overall a great company.","Commercial Underwriting Associate","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 13, 2020","5.0"
" this bank seems to lack a corporate culture that promotes the inclusion and advancement of blacks and latinos."," this bank, especially in the Greater Philadelphia market, must do a better job of recruiting, developing and promoting black people. Implicit bias is a company wide challenge the needs to be addressed in a deliberate and focused way. In a majority minority city like Philadelphia it seems odd that there are so few senior and executive leaders of color, in particular black people in meaningful leadership roles where they can make hiring/firing decisions.","Relationship Manager","Former Employee","1600 Market St.","January 11, 2020","3.0"

"Diverse loving group!","I guess my experience was different than the rest. I have an awesome group of coworkers that became a second family to me. 0010745 was the best decision for me! The manager made sure I was always trying to reach my goals! My coworkers weren't only worried about my work life, but also worried about my personal life. I think we all grew together, while employed there. I would recommend my hoem beach to anyone!","Teller","Former Employee","Riviera Beach, FL","January 10, 2020","4.0"
"Great company to work for. Trust me I would know. Better than the other Banks","Great company to work for. I worked for an agency on a contract but still treated fairly.

"Corporate management cares little about employees. The only thing that matters is profit.","I would never recommend this as a place to work. Expectations are unrealistic, cuts are made with low level employees, no such thing as company loyalty or job security, they talk about employee engagement but sow seeds of fear and uncertainty...I could go on.","BM","Former Employee","Ohio","January 7, 2020","2.0"

"Has is positives and negatives","I have mixed reviews. I like working for the company and although they promote working to get you a better position, some management doesn't seem to try or care. Also, you don't get paid for the work you do beyond the basics. And sometimes not even that. There is no raises and during the 'year end reviews', they are minimal, if at all.","Outreach Sales Representative","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 6, 2020","3.0"
