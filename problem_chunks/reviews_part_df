4150,"Not recomended","This job, is the job like any other in the field, you sell your soul along with your morals. I learned quite a bit about financial institution, however realizing that I was pushing people into doing things with there money they might not otherwise do, and leading them in a misdirection of debt, if I didn't do this then I was not eligible for a raise and would have weekly conferences about what was wrong with my 'sales ethic'. It was disgusting to say the least, and the competition and cruelty of the others realizing what we were doing got so disgraceful I couldn't feel good about what I did everyday.","Teller","Former Employee","Nags Head, NC","December 9, 2016","2.0"

All I wanted to do was update my resume and now I have been reviewing my previous jobs for 15 minutes, this is none of anyones business how I feel about my past work experiences. This part should be optional!","Default Specialist II","Current Employee","Rocky Mount, NC","December 7, 2016","3.0"
4153,"Great place to pick up skills","My experience at this bank has been an interesting one. I started as a teller then advance to sales and service rep with a few months so I was fortunate for that opportunity. I typical day at work consists of me running around from platform to teller side all day even though I was told before hire and during training that there would be designated days when I would work each side so it wouldn't become overwhelming. Other than your 2 weeks vacation (and you have to take one full consecutive week) and 10 paid holidays you really have no work life balance. I know that sounds a lot but think about it, if the day you have off is a holiday what can you really get done that day? My coworkers are great though. Never had a problem with any of them despite the high turnover at my branch. I truly stay because I love my clients. Most of them are so nice and make my day.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","December 7, 2016","3.0"
4154,"Great place to work","I usually worked on negative accounts. Call customers to see if they could make a payment by phone that day or within the next 5 business day.

4156,"Great workplace","Loved working at this bank. Management was great. Had a lots of changes in last fews years.

4158,"Good Job High Pressure","Not a bad company but over the years the pay plan gets progressively worse for all but the top performers. If you leave you have to forfeit bonuses earned because there is a 30 plus day delay in bonus payment and once you are gone all earned bonuses are not paid. How is this legal! Required to use personal phone for business purposes but receive no compensation. Mileage is capped regardless of sales territory.","Merchant Services Representative","Former Employee","Maryland","December 6, 2016","3.0"
4159,"Heartbroken and Disappointed","I worked for this bank for almost 6 years. Started as a Teller and moved my way up to a Branch Manager. Never once left the company for more money at other banks because I was loyal to this bank. Never in 6 years was there a huge complaint on me or was I ever investigated for anything. Loved the people that I worked with in my branch as well as a few of my business partners, coworkers, and direct managers. Turned the branch I managed from the bottom branch in our region into one of the top performing branches. Now with all that back ground I will give you the rest of the story. I was in the process of being investigated for some ridiculous things that had pretty much nothing to do with banking and everything to do with my personal life. Which let me say is not very exciting or active. During the interview I will take responsibility for not completely giving accurate information in the beginning but before the interview was over I gave the information they asked again correctly. Once the investigation was complete I was let go because I did not give the accurate answer the first time. Even though I gave them the accurate answer when they said they were going to ask me one more time in the end. Do I feel I was without wrong in the situation NO but do I feel that I was wronged by a company I was loyal to for almost 6 year YES!!!!! It doesn't matter who you are or what you do for them at the end of the day you are just another number they can replace and that is so sad.","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Alabama","December 6, 2016","2.0"

4161,"Read 5 Dysfunctions of a Team","Management & the culture they create would get negative stars if it were a choice.

4162,"Great Company as a whole, terrible if you work in retail banking","I liked working with different people and being able to help customers with their finances, but nothing was ever enough.
