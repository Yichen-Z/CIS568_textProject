2800,"Isolated review","I think my review may be biased due to the management I worked under during my time at this bank. Unfortunately that manager was rude, unethical and quite literally verbally abusive to their staff. The team I worked with was excellent though - very hard working, friendly, supportive of one another. Pay was mediocre, and the bonus program was pretty much a joke. Benefits were good though, and there were lots of opportunities to advance if you were able to stick things out.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Toledo, OH","February 7, 2018","3.0"
2801,"24/7 culture. You are always on call.","Typical day begins at 7:30am answering e-mails from previous evening and early morning. Workplace culture morphed into a 24/7 need to be available.

The most enjoyable part was the meeting, hiring, & assisting them in their jobs.","Senior Operations Manager","Former Employee","Pennsylvania","February 7, 2018","4.0"
2802,"Lack of Management","There is not a good system of management. Most of the managers expect you to read their minds and their is no clear instructions given.

2807,"Work Day at this bank - Collaborative & Competitive","A day at this bank starts early at 7. My project is a data migration project that is at quite a demanding phase. The management is quite helpful and at the same time are completely aware of what they are doing. Its a collaborative & competitive work culture where you learn and share your experiences. Working with bigger teams can be equally painful as it can be fun.

2809,"great place to work for steady low pay","I worked for this bank lockbox as an operations specialist for nearly ten years. I enjoyed my job overall, and was happy with my work. The issues that I encountered were the increasing amount of work without any increased pay also my manager hovered and watched every move that I made along with others. I get that, that was a part of his job, but most adults do not like to be micro managed. For example, my bathroom time down to the seconds was clocked. It is a high paced production environment, but certain things like relieving your bladder should not be managed. Also so much negative emphasis would be placed on one error rather than the 1000+ correct things you've already entered. I learned a lot and I respect that job for my growth; with that being said, I am so glad that I left. My pay has increased, I am no longer being micromanaged, and I meet all of my deadlines on time with no issues. Also If I happen to make a mistake, my supervisor talks to me with respect to remedy any concerns. I no longer feel like my livelihood is threatened with each error.","Senior Operations Specialist","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","February 6, 2018","3.0"

2814,"Great place to work, good job community","A typical day was fun but challenging. I was able to do multiple projects while relying on my team to help us move forward as a branch and company.

2822,"Be a big producer or go somewhere else","Being a brand new Mortgage Loan officer I didn't realize it would take 1.5 year to 2 or more years to create the relationships that would lead to getting enough loans to pay the bills. 1.5 years in and you learn from mistakes, that you should have someone mentoring you through. To be successful here you need to established with outside relationships. Need to bring in over a million a month on your own to make a regular 60K salary. The pay out is based on tiering schedule, so less than that really doesn't help pay your bills. The base pay is non-forgivable, which means you pay it back. So you have to make sure you are closing every month enough to cover the base pay and enough to make a living for yourself. If you have a month without closings, they pay your base salary, but next month they will take it out of your pay. If you make 2000 and owe 500 because of a deficit you get paid 1500.00. You don't need a state license, but if you are licensed you can get better pay working for a banker or broker.
