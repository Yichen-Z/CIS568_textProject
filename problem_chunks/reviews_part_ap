This isn't unexpected or necessarily bad, but it can seem as though sales is prioritized and rewarded over other areas such as customer service. If you are good at sales, it can be rewarding. The politics and other people trying to get ahead can eroded the sense of trust and team environment. The regulations in the banking industry make it difficult for any problem solving or outside the box thinking. Very focus on risk control and compliance.

Despite me basically harassing them to set up and confirm appointments with my business banking partners who dropped the ball.
