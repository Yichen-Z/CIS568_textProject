"Never Work Here.","Currently work here as an application developer. They simply do not respect your time of home life. They will work you all kinds of crazy hours. I have worked many 20 hour days. Management does not follow this bank's rules and guidelines. They're pretty much given free reign and aren't govern or checked, so basically, you're at the mercy of your manager whether you perform well or not. Minorities have a harder time getting management positions. They are overworking their skilled employees and underworking the people right out of college with no skills.

"Great Place to Work","A typical day at this bank would start off with a short meeting about goals and what the focus is for the day. You will get the opportunity to learn as much as you can. Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking. My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to that plan. That's the best way to succeed. The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet. The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with the territory. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for it among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner.

The turn over rate for this bank is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact). So if you don't mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you're willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than this bank is the place for you.

Although we got quarterly bonuses, my hourly pay was significantly less than other tellers from other companies. this bank just recently changed their pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service.

The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny. The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for. The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are. All in all, this bank is a great company to work for.

The scenarios given and the training provided does not, realistically, give you any sense of what you will be doing on a day to day basis. Once training ends, you are essentially on your own and any questions you ask can be answered any number of different ways depending on who you ask.

"Typical bank","Nothing new. Its a bank job and can be a good place to hone your customer service skills. No flexibility on hours and you don't get the best pay. Still ok place to work.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Exton, PA","October 18, 2017","3.0"
"The hardest part of the job","The hardest part of this role is the on-the-job training experience for handling the sales and service sides of a branch store. You attend 3-5 day training workshops periodically to learn all about sales. However, there is not much preparation for handling scenarios in which you would need to provide services to customers.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Plainsboro, NJ","October 17, 2017","3.0"
"game room nice office","A typical day would be answering incoming calls from customers about there banking account working there I have learned to do different things all at one time the management there is great they are very caring and understanding the hardest part of the job to me is having to explain to customers where they may have went wrong on there account but the best thing about the job is getting to know customer that you never meat before and getting to know them from just a conversation","Customer service","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 17, 2017","5.0"
"stressful","the company is all about sales. Your life doesn't matter there is no support for new hires, employees are rude and not helpful, management doesn't care. unless you go in with prior this bank experience you are pretty much set up for failure.","Teller Lead","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA 19103","October 17, 2017","3.0"
"Fun to work","I have enjoyed working there and the place that I worked that I learned a lot about this and their management was good. Sometimes I get under pressure and I managed to get by the deadlines.","Data Entry Associates","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA","October 17, 2017","5.0"
" this bank is the most underhanded company to work for","Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for it. this bank does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset that over time. this bank lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits them. Management is an absolute joke. If you ever try to leave the company, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, those managers will try everything in their power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if they can help it. I know from personal experience. Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet those goals, this bank won't fire you for not meeting the goals, but they WILL fire you for not doing your 'job'. The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if this bank is not careful, they will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has. I would never recommend this company to ANYONE.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Tuscaloosa, AL","October 17, 2017","1.0"
"Long hours no management support"," this bank is the only bank I have ever worked for that did not require dual control to open or close the branch. Often times you were there by yourself all day.","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Timonium, MD","October 16, 2017","2.0"
"Work life Balance","Work life Balance is not balanced to well. The majority of my weekends I would often find myself having to put my family to the side to satisfy this bank and any additional free time / family time i would have to commit to this bank related activities.","Service Associate","Current Employee","Alpharetta, GA","October 16, 2017","3.0"
"a lot required for little return","As a bssa you are required to exceed sales and have many goals which aren't reasonable based on your branch. Pay is low for the load work you take....","Branch Sales Service Associate","Current Employee","NJ","October 15, 2017","4.0"
"Great place to work","I really like my job I came with no banking experience but the training is very helpful I was able to earn a promotion in less than 6 months off being hired. They have a rule that you keep each position 1 year unless you have a written recommendation from your manager. My coworkers are great and very helpful and supportive. I have met several people who worked for the company who are either retired or quit that told me to stay it's a great place to work.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Current Employee","Detroit, MI","October 15, 2017","5.0"
"Great benefits but poor management","Upper management has been degrading the quality and compansation of the job. Difficult to move up and raise are less than 1 percent. Bonus have difficult to come by and over the past 3 years have halved in the amount they pay out while manage have denied that they have.","Default specialist sr","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 14, 2017","3.0"
"Grea work environment","Recommend - friendly atmosphere, good work/life balance, tuition reimbursement, ability to develop career path and develop additional skills. Pleasant place to work!","Legal Secretary","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 14, 2017","5.0"
"Rocky start, terribble management","The training process was lengthy and frustrating. You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved them in a timely manner. Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees. There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts. She would come and go for hours as she pleased. We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff. There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue. I personally felt demeaned and pushed aside by the branch manager.","Teller","Former Employee","Akron, OH","October 13, 2017","2.0"
"Good full time job while in college","While in college, this was an ideal job. The flexible scheduling mixed with the busy workplace was productive. However, despite popular belief, this job is predominantly sales. Goals are set high and are difficult to meet unless you really know how to talk. You have to be willing to learn, as the coaching is there. I would only recommend to those who are willing to learn to strategically sell - and you must be a people person.","Service Associate","Current Employee","Clifton, NJ","October 13, 2017","4.0"
" this bank - Good place to work","Very Challenging, motivating, and been blessed to work with great people. this bank is in growth market and looking to grow, so activities and sales are demanding. Good and diverse culture.","Branch Manager","Current Employee","NC","October 13, 2017","4.0"

"its a job","Its a good place to work at if your good at making sales. I'm not a sale person so this is not the best fit for me. Customer service I'm good with its just a matter of being nice to ppl. Westfield is the worst place to be a teller just fyi.","Teller","Current Employee","Westfield, NJ","October 13, 2017","3.0"
" this bank","the job was very faced paced learned a lot about cross selling and how to sell to people doing their grocery shopping and having to compete with a tradition branch that is in the same shopping center","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Wilmington, DE","October 12, 2017","4.0"
"review","all of these companies to the forefront can need more work with communication with executive that pushing a none realistic deaf tone bar and from experience it does not make the work place a great place to be around","Detail oriented sales professional","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","October 12, 2017","2.0"
