4200,"Company Gives Back to the Community but Lacks on the Inside"," this bank is a great company, however, the leadership or management needs an overhaul. Each branch has its own culture. One group of people are allowed to do certain things while others are not. The policy and procedures are uniform but we are informed and encouraged to do differently. Management allows bullying and instigation of hostile work environment. Great experience at one branch and totally polar opposite experience at the other branch.","Service Representative","Current Employee","Mobile, AL","November 12, 2016","2.0"

4207,"No Work/Life Balance","Co-workers here are fantastic, made the day better. Typical day at work was spent calling clients on investments. Did learn a lot here as the shear volume of clients contacted forced learning and how to sell. Management here is non-existent. Never knew what was going on or how to manage people. Micro-managed to the max (needed to know what you were doing every minute of the day). Back-office individuals don't contact you, just go behind your back with everything that happens. Lots of 'I only care about myself and won't help you' goes on here.","Financial Advisor","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","November 8, 2016","3.0"

4217,"decent place to work","Although I had worked for this bank for 20+ years I was never sure if I was going to have my job tomorrow. Management took one tiny mistake and made it into a monumental ordeal. Although I was not fired I felt like a tiny mistake after 20 years was counted against me. I worked very hard, I was a very good employee but one small error is more important to them than long-term loyalty and hard work","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Whippany, NJ","October 30, 2016","4.0"
4218,"Never again.","I felt completely out of place the first week I started at this bank. The managers were always down my throat about sales goals, and incentives, whilst I was still in the learning process. We (as tellers) weren't really allowed to do anything besides transactions, and we weren't to know to much information about credit cards or accounts, because it wasn't our job to know, it was our job to sit them down with a personal banker, and there job was to sell any product they could to them. I had balancing issues there, and I have never had that problem with anywhere else, including working at credit union prior to that. I never felt like I could go to the managers, because I always felt that they were judging me and wanted me out of there before I even began to take root. Plus the assistant manager was leaving for other job interviews, even though she was supposed to be working, and would leave us swamped. ( If that doesn't tell you why not to work for this bank then I don't know what does.) Better offers, better opportunity is out there. This bank pays extremely low, and for the pressure and the work required I am glad I am not there anymore. I was let go from the company which is fine. I did not like it there, and I will never work for a bank again. There whole goal in life is to sell products, and the rates are so low, I would never recommend putting any of your money with them.

4222,"Great Place to Work, Messy Management","Typical banking environment. Get to meet a lot of people. Goals are constantly changing. Cannot keep up with management.

4241,"Not a good place to work","I am currently employed with this bank, so this is not a a former employee that is angry with the company. It is not a good place to work if you are on the front line with direct customer engagement. It actually borders on hostile from management to meet sales goals, or else.. They pay is well below market and the benefits are terrible As a senior relationship manager, I am required to be on the road most of the time, visiting business clients and driving new business. They recently announced that the bank would no longer reimburse any cell phone expense or any expense over $30 unless it was pre approved by management. My region, which has 1200 employees, has lost and had to replace 600 of the 1200 employees every year for the past 3 years. Numerous retail managers I work directly with have had to take stress related leave due to the over all work conditions. It appears that most of the positive reviews about this bank seem to come from back office employees that shuffle paper and have no customer interaction I have been with this bank for over 5 years. It is not a good place to work and grow any career.","Business Relationship Manager","Current Employee","East Coast","October 10, 2016","2.0"
