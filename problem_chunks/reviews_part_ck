3104,"Decent Compensation, Not Much Else","This was the type of job that gives you training, and seemingly plenty of it, yet when you actually get to the implementation it is vastly different. The scenarios given and the training provided does not, realistically, give you any sense of what you will be doing on a day to day basis. Once training ends, you are essentially on your own and any questions you ask can be answered any number of different ways depending on who you ask. It is rather haphazard and not recommended.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 8, 2017","1.0"

3111,"Burnout, poor work / life balance","The fraud organization at this bank is a never ending series of management, direction, and organizational changes. Stability is very uncommon therefore no one has the chance to develop into the role before another reorganization unfolds. Work life balance is very poor unfortunately - unrealistic expectations at the executive level and no staffing support leads to long hours, frustration, and burnout. There are lots of managers but very few (in any) leaders in the fraud space, I cannot say this is how other areas of this bank operate as I have never worked outside the fraud space.","fraud","Current Employee","PA","November 5, 2017","1.0"
