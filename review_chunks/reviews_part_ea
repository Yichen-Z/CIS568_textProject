5202,"Great co-workers, long days","I love the people that I work with, they make the days fun and are very patient when someone is in the learning process. I also love my manager, she is very involved and always available if needed. But, I haven't had an entire weekend off for a month and likely won't until July. Saturdays off are supposed to rotate. They do offer benefits, but the health insurance and dental plans aren't the best. The deductible is over 2 grand for health insurance and the dental plan has a $1,500 annual cap. Hourly pay is ok, but don't plan on being able to support yourself solely on this income (Unless you are a platform banker, then you may have a chance). One highlight is that we get an hour for lunch, the con is long work days. Fridays are usually 7:45 am to 6:15 pm. Then you have to be back Saturday morning at 7:45 am. Most days you are 7:45 am to 5:15 pm. But some days you may be 10-2 or 9-5. The only thing consistent is you know you'll have to be there at some point 6 days a week.","Teller Rep I","Current Employee","Missouri","May 17, 2015","3.0"

Management can be very pushy about sales but they definitely provide us recognition for accomplishing our goals. Full staff at the branch is a maximum of 5 employees including the manager. The hardest part of the job is overcoming the fear of approaching customers while they are food shopping.
