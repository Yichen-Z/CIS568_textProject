"Loss mitigation","This company could be awesome, but the experience is taken away by manegerial flaws to the 25th power. Any company you work based on culture starts at the top. this bank loss mitigation department heads have no real relationships with what is going on with staff and barely supervisors.

They believe in a do as i say not as i do sort of management style. They are exempt we are not kind of attitude creating an us against them mentality. This is not good management and it starts from the top. Seldom do you hear any good news from the loss mit dept. They also do layoffs each year. They tell you there are no layoffs. Then turn right around and do it. They also you personal agenda's to pick who goes. If your looking for safety, happiness, home, and a feeling that you matter this is not the spot.If you looking for drama, constant change, no help, no sympathy, not making it easier for employees to maximize their job. this bank is not the place!

"Good company...low pay","The environment was great. The people are great. The only con I have with this bank is the compensation is on the low end for finance. There are bonus opportunities, but until you hit the upper levels of management the compensation is lacking. You do work in a 9-5 environment and that is a big plus. The part of this role that was the most irritating was the outbound calling of your customers. Having to dial 15 customers per day to 'invite' (solicit) them to come in for a financial checkup was never fun.

"Not for the faint of heart"," this bank tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all. Even in emergency situations. The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day. For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again. Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Oshtemo, MI","June 5, 2017","3.0"

Management is awesome with all warm and smiling faces. The hardest part of the job would be sitting at a desk alone without anybody around to communicate with while at the same time that is also the best part because it leads to better focus and work flow.

Management (based off of location) is helpful to a point, but often is unavailable for assistance. Every day is different which is exciting but can also cause unneeded stress like most customer service related positions can be. Workplace culture is best described as 'every man for themselves' most days. A few colleagues will band together, but there is a lot of disconnect between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of my day is definitely helping clients reach their financial goals. Nothing makes me more excited to walk in the front door, than knowing I can help someone get out of debt, or buy a new house for their family.

I also have clearance to do supervisor duties and task but I'm only a titled as a teller and receive teller pay. I even applied for the job and was denied it, even though I am currently 'doing' the job now and has been for the past month. there has been other people here for many years and they said it has been years since the even got a raise in pay. and there are many days we don't even get a lunch because of staffing issues. my branch manager is awesome though and the only reason why this bank got this much of my time","Teller","Current Employee","Ohio","May 11, 2017","2.0"

I wasn't put in a position to succeed. Money wasn't bad, but it was very stressful being put into situations where you didn't know what to do and I couldn't go to anyone in the branch for help.

There is so much turnover that people who should not be in management are moved into management positions - it's not just the lack of management experience but the overall lack of leadership People were walked out for reasons that were never explained leaving you to wonder if you were doing something wrong and not aware of it and if you were going to be next My observation was that people were often singled out as if they were looking for a way to get rid of them by giving them extra tasks to complete that were not required of others in that position; basically making their life so miserable that they would look for another job.","Sales","Former Employee","Southeast","May 3, 2017","1.0"
