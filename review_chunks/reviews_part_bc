1411,"Branch Sales and Service Represntative","Hired as a BSSR but the bank was under-staffed and I was made into a teller. Call center began routing phone calls to local branches so the phone rang off the hook constantly. Very challenging trying to provide qualtiy customer service under these conditions. Most days we did not get a lunch break. In my opinion upper management slashed headcount in branch banking too much.","Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Moon Township, PA","July 15, 2019","2.0"
1412,"Terrible"," this bank starts off great, leaves you with high hopes for your future. You do pretty intense training but it is basically just how to use the extremely out of date software. After training, you are expected to know the ins and out of banking. No real training on the things you deal with day to day. Schedule changes daily and although you are told you have to work 1 Saturday a month, you end up working 3 if not 4. Upper management and HR is useless.","Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Yardley, PA","July 14, 2019","2.0"
1413,"A place to build experience","What I have learned about this bank is that the executives and upper management are highly guaranteed raises and advancement. While the lower management within the company gives praises for the employees work it is hard to move up if you are not a favorite. On the positive it is easy to build relationships with common coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers.","OPERATIONS ANALYST II","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA","July 13, 2019","3.0"

1415,"Poor management, potentially good company","In my personal experience I advise anyone who has an interest in working for this company to do your best to find a job downtown. The branch managers are incompetent and will fire anyone or throw you under the bus if it saves themselves. While I've heard nothing but great things in other departments, working in a branch, specifically with an unprofessional, uneducated manager where I worked will only cause loathing of the company.","Teller Lead","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 10, 2019","2.0"

1424,"Outdated Penny-Pinchers","If the large banks were family members, this bank would be the crusty, mean grandfather, that never wants things to change. this bank lives in the past. The pay is far below average and health benefits are HDHP only. this bank's technology is horrible and usually doesn't work, even the customer facing technology. Shareholders love this bank, because this bank never spends money. That means no training opportunities, travel, or perks.

1426,"Overall the company is not bad; beware of bad management"," this bank overall is not a bad place to work (depending on your location and the turnover rate.) They have employee awards and events to attend. Volunteer hours that you get back as paid time off. They don't like overtime so you're more likely to leave on time and not have to worry about work after leaving. I went without a branch manager for well over half a year, picked up the slack, took care of things that I could. I wanted a position that involved operations and being a banker because I was doing the work without the compensation. I was denied. I then left the company and they put up an open position for operations and banker (the position I wanted) because they realized it was better to have a single banker do the excess rather than having the manager do everything and 4 bankers try to resolve audits, filing, etc. Highly disappointing.","Senior Private Banker","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","July 6, 2019","4.0"

I was given a warning after my white male assistant manager reported that i scared him. In the days we we live this is no culture for a young black man.

They are willing to work with you to get you into better positions, and you can always try and advance your knowledge of the company. There are remote positions, and partially remote positions. I myself work from home 2 days a week, and I have 4 weeks of vacation time, swing holidays, and sick time. The only problems I have ever had with the company is the pay is generally on the low end of the scale compared to some competitors, but I have found the pension and other benefits make up for this. The organization is constantly changing as they expand into the West, so some positions change, butnif you are a hard worker, they will be sure you are moved to where you need to be in the company during these changes.","Loan Support Analyst","Current Employee","Miamisburg, OH","July 1, 2019","5.0"
