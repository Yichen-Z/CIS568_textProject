Lastly lots of coffee In regards to learning, I learned a lot about financial products and how they work such as mortgages. I learned how to provide really good customer service Management was very respectful but many times somewhat hypocritical in their demands for meeting goals Hardest part was dealing with very rude customers and making sales goals with products such as credit cards because many people would not qualify The most enjoyable part was helping really great clients. There were many of them that were very appreciative and nice. Also the coffee was pretty good.","Universal Banker","Former Employee","Fort Lauderdale, FL","August 9, 2016","3.0"

4360,"Stressful environment for low pay but provides good experience and benefits if you stay long enough.","I've been with the bank for four years in two separate positions. In both positions I've been one of the top performers in my region but nothing is ever good enough and getting anything above an mediocre review and subsequently a decent raise is extremely difficult. They will always find one category you didn't hit goal at and use it to justify their position. Bonuses can be great or horrible depending on your position and time of year. The incentive plan changes all the time. They have gone as far as to change incentive negatively for products you've already sold but of course only positively for future sales. Turnover is extremely high and staffing is a constant issue. It's not uncommon to run at half staff for months at a time, meanwhile the goals and expectations stay the same. It's not uncommon that you have to do two people's jobs. Then of course you work constant overtime and take short or no lunch. I've had co-workers quit and walk out, go to lunch and never come back, no call no show for days then quit, have panic attacks at work and have to leave, all because of the stress level and demands of the job. The benefits package is nice but you have to be with the company for 6 months before you get your full benefits and 3 years before your vested in their 401(k) and pension. So if you leave for any reason before 3 years, you lose them.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","August 7, 2016","2.0"
