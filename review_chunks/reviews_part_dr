4760,"Terrible place","I worked at this bank For 2 years tho it had its good times there was far less of them then bad times. First they train you that this bank is all about its employees and they care about you. It's a lie they care about you if your not a teller. Second sales oriented ok I understand all companies are about making money but at a bank you always see the same people so it's frustrating when you shove credit cards down the throats of the same people every week then when the customer flips out on you for annoying them it's your fault for not positioning the 'conversation' correctly. Third the amount your salary is at this bank is peanuts for the amount of stuff your required to do. And if you end up in the Lehigh valley region in pa your job is threated daily if your not performing to expectations. The amount of stress I endured working there cause me to develop medical issues that I now take pills to prevent. And the high deductibles from there insurance plans didn't make it easy for me to get medical attention for the issues developing from the stress. So all and all my experiences at this bank where terrible the only good thing was I was traveling 5 miles to work.","Financial sales consultant","Former Employee","Lehigh Valley, PA","November 24, 2015","1.0"
