4808,"Solid Company but lacking in advancement opportunities","A typical day for me consists of early morning conference calls followed by outside sales activation. Everyday my work location varies based on events scheduled for the week. I've learned how to juggle personal sales goals and management of a sales force including relationship building within a large market. Management doesn't seemed to be aligned with customer facing employees throughout the market which is a key factor in me seeking new employment. There is a very high turnover of employees in the company which makes it difficult to establish best practices that lead to positive results. The hardest pat of my job is having to deal with so many different personalities without any real support from my direct management. Philadelphia is the largest market in the company and I'm equipped with a team of four to meet the demands of such a large network. The best part of my job is that I am not tied down to any office as I am part of a mobile team.

4816,"Great benefits, but unsure if it can hold up the remaining mess..."," this bank is not a bad company to work for. The benefits are, in fact, rather exceptional, with health, vision, dental, and even a 401(k) plan matching at 4%. A lot of times, however, it does appear that upper management seems to be running in circles. I work in the branch in downtown Mechanicsburg where our regional manager's office resides, so you'd think they'd have a more keen sense on what's going on - they don't. Our regional manager is up a flight of stairs no more than 10 steps, and he JUST learned my name a few weeks ago - I got hired in February and it's now the end of October. When it comes to the sales side of things, it's not difficult to make goals. You do get a nice compensation depending on what job position you take. If you're in it for a bit of 'commission' then you're better off going for a Financial Sales Consultant role and should steer clear of a Teller or Customer Service Associate. Depending on how many accounts you open, credit cards you sell, loans you apply for, or even referrals you submit, you'll earn $6. You could spend 10 minutes opening an account for $6, where at the same time you could apply for a loan, have to keep an eye on it for weeks, keep in contact with them and up to date about it, and set yourself reminders to continuously observe the status of it and ultimately set up an appointment for a loan closing (sometimes months later). How much do you get for that? $6 (that's if you're a customer service associate - financial sales consultant works a bit differently). The nice thing, however, is that if you refer a customer to Investments and - more...","Customer Service Associate","Current Employee","Mechanicsburg, PA","October 26, 2015","3.0"

There are levels that are very committed to an agile form of project management while the underlying management takes that with a grain of salt and proceeds to move forward with their own ideology and process. There is a great deal of dysfunction in this organization that would lead one to believe that it is impossible to predict how a career would go, let alone the first year of employment. As a former military member it is easy to see from a team perspective that this is a recipe for disaster. And, if you cannot move ahead with positive influence it is best to remove yourself from the line of fire.

4830,"You Are Just A Number and Customer Service is Awful. Stressful and Low Pay","This company has changed a lot in the last few years. They are getting rid of workers all of the time. You are just a number hence why job security is one star. One mistake and you are gone. 6 months ago i went from sitting in a room of tellers and now sit in a room of new tellers. They fired a woman who has worked here 30 years because of one mistake. Took benefits away from her 6 months before retirement! Training is a month long and worthless. You are told to sell to people no matter the situation, if the teller line is full of people you still have to tell a person in a hurry to leave, if they would like a credit card it's B.S. and to top it off they are always under-staffed so if someone wants a credit card they have to make an appointment to see a banker a few days later! you get 6 dollars for referrals. They also have customer survey scores and you and the rest of the team get bonuses when the group scored highly BUT you need a 4.8 score out of 5 which is impossible because so many customers come in angry because we have new people working every week and we are always under-staffed. If you want to work at a bank don't work for this one especially if you're just starting out, you make 9-10 dollars an hour to be way too stressed out because of sales, making customers happy in an environment that is impossible to do so, and being worried you wont have a job tomorrow.","Customer Representative","Current Employee","Rockford IL","October 20, 2015","2.0"
