3205,"Lack of communication, poor management and no sense of direction.","This place is a sink or swim type of job. There is NO training that actually teaches anyone how to do their job. Because everything is so numbers driven, co-workers can't/won't make time to help new people out, and those who do are punished with poor performance ratings. Suggestions for improvement are ignored. Upper management is too busy having meetings about the meetings they have to actually take time to talk to their 'minions' to find out what is happening in the office and how they can help make the workplace a better environment. Quarterly financials talk about how much the bank is making, but at year end review they can't afford to give their employees raises. Employees feel like they are just numbers and not truly appreciated. The occasional lunch and snacks do not make up for all of the negativity in the division.","Mortgage Division","Current Employee","Jacksonville, FL","October 9, 2017","2.0"

3225,"Management changed often","You never knew from one month to the next what the strategy was and can only be described as a series of 'charge' and then 'retreat commands'. Working hours were rough because the branches were never fully staffed and we were constantly measured against Gallup polls that we could never do well on due to staffing.

3238,"Could be better","The company preaches customer service first which is great; Employees were taught to take a care of the customers, and most did, but I feel that the company could have done a better job of taking care of the employees. The pay is very low compared to most retail banking companies so sales associates try to make up for the compensation through commission. However, the company is doing more and more to push customers to bank on their own as opposed to in the branch, which in turn makes it more difficult for employees to hit the sales numbers in order to earn a decent commission. this bank is constantly looking for employees--that's good for some, bad for others.","Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","New Jersey","September 28, 2017","2.0"
