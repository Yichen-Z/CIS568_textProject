3050,"Teller responsibilities are achievable, but skewed.","Although there was a 'typical day' expectation, a typical day was rather rare. Pushing sales and dealing with off-loaded phone calls added great stress to the day's rhythm. Be sure to keep your personal life absent. Diversity is lauded, until it is demonstrated. this bank prefers robots; and that is what is expected. Prepare to be bullied - at great length. Do not share challenges, as they will become obstacles. Smile, be polite, and lie: These are the qualities that this bank prefers.","Teller II","Former Employee","Virginia","November 30, 2017","1.0"

3054,"Fast paced halftime, poor management","the management at the branch I was placed was horrible. I was never trained in the branch. There's no direction or guidance at all. I learned through trial and error. The day moves pretty slow and many tasks aren't that hard but all the inside information, like rules and policies, and branch codes and safety wasn't taught to me and is essential for doing the job.

3069,"Productive & high volume position","Our department recently experienced a change in management. Over the past few years under previous management, there were no promotions, non-competitive compensation, bare minimum raises, hardly no work/home life balance and zero appreciation (from upper management). These situations have led to low morale and very high employee turnover; we have been losing talent to other banks that provide much better compensation.

3074,"Extremely micromanaged","Heavily micromanaged throughout the day. Worked in a 'Universal branch', meaning we did the jobs of both tellers and platform bankers, but were not compensated any more for it. Co-workers were great, but the manager did a poor job of preparing me when I first started and you are put into a sink-or-swim environment. Benefits were ok, but the pay was extremely lacking compared to what bankers at other banks receive. Also, deceptive hiring as they do not tell you about the cold sale calls you will be making. Ok job if you have a salesman personality, but would not recommend for most people.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","Southampton, NJ","November 21, 2017","3.0"

3079,"Fast-Paced, Fun Atmosphere","I loved my job at this bank. The employees I worked with were superior to any other place I had been, and the manager for the branch was truly amazing. There was always a push for sales, but it was always a need based sale. The incentive system was pretty good, but could definitely be improved, as your largest bonus was at the mercy of every client, which could or could not hurt you. Often, any poor reviews were due to circumstance out of your control. However, though there were bad interactions, all of the positive interactions made your day great.

3084,"Great people to work with","My role as a teller was great because I was able to help many households with their financial well-being but the pay for my job was not consistent with the quality of work I was putting into it. Although we got quarterly bonuses, my hourly pay was significantly less than other tellers from other companies. this bank just recently changed their pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service.

However, for further advancement, it seems nonexistent. The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny. The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for. The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are. All in all, this bank is a great company to work for. My passion is just leading me elsewhere.","Client Solution Specialist","Current Employee","Chicago, IL","November 15, 2017","3.0"
