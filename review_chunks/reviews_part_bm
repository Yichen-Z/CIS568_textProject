They micromanage everything in the branches which is okay for some but others may find difficulty with the servere lack of autonomy. Company does care about customers and growth but I'm not sure about it's lower level employers. Pay isn't great, hours aren't great, lunch isn't paid, branch stay open late and somehow I almost always ended up closing and getting home at 7pm (banker hours apparently). My branch never accepted snow emergencies as reason to be late despite multiple roads being closed and whitnessing a car slide off the road in front of me - literally call 911 and directed them to the car which went down a hill but still got yelled at.","Financial Specialist","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 19, 2018","4.0"

1935,"Predatory Capitalism"," this bank is not atypical within corporate America -- but it is certainly just as appalling and unethical as any other bank, it simply wields many jargon-laced smoke screens with which to shield itself. My manager barely acts like a human being. In fact, almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments) are human-like at all. Speaking to them, it's like there is not a single genuine bone in their body, like the humanity has been slowly winnowed out of their soul. I've sat in on meetings and calls where not a single direct, or useful, thing was said in two entire hours. They are attempting to turn their employees into jargon-spewing monsters, too; utter automatons. Positioning and capability statements are gross and no one - particularly not younger people - will ever be drawn in by an in-person commercial delivered by a robotic employee. With the heavy sales focus, we are highly incentivized to focus all of our attention to wealthy clients while ignoring the impoverished and those with genuine need. The overdraft fees are predatory and atrocious - and this bank is content to continue to milk the elderly and physically disabled for fees that continue to make their financial life a source of stress and chaos. I've been tempted to recommend customers like that to another bank. I genuinely hope that when younger people garner the reins of power from institutions like these, that the bloodsucking corporate leeches are thrown out. Also, voiceCX is terrible.
