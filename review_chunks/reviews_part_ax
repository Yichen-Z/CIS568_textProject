I am aware that in banking there needs to be money coming in in order to grow. However, It is shoved down our throats that we need to click the 'insight' button for each and every client that comes in. The insight button is an automated message that tells you what to say to the client in regards to opening new accounts, credit cards, investments and so on. If you do not click the insight button you are reprimanded. They pull numbers to see how many transactions you did, how many times you clicked the button, and if the client got any new products. It is very stressful. Bonuses? HAH. They tell you that you can get incentive pay if you receive 5 stars on surveys....never got that. It is a total score for the entire branch. If one person receives a not so good review you can kiss that bonus good bye. They make a lot of promises but honestly they make it impossible to reach their expected goals.
