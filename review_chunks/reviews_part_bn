1951,"poor management and very competitive","Very competitive, you can get corrective action write ups a lot due to a lot of laws and regulations. Those who do not follow policy and procedures, spend a lot of time doing personal things are the ones that get promoted, not the ones that actually do what they are supposed to.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Grand Rapids, MI","November 12, 2018","2.0"

1953,"Great place","This is a great place to work for the benefits and pay, but if you're looking to advance it's almost impossible.

1956,"productive, positive.","My manager was very nice. But his manager(the regional) wasn't. The atmosphere is pretty competitive among coworkers but as far as the company, you're expected to sell sell sell, even when there are no new customers. It's nonstop standing the entire time, which was unexpected since I picture platform bankers sitting behind a desk.

1959,"Room for growth"," this bank is definitely a company where there is room for growth. There are a lot of opportunities in many different roles. There are a lot of benefits for new employees coming on board from salary to PTO. However, for those who have been with the company for 5, 10, 15 years they feel that they are being left behind and that this bank don't appreciate their loyalty as new employees are getting some of the same benefits they only received by doing their time. Also, they are coming in with better pay.","Assistant Manager","Current Employee","New Jersey","November 10, 2018","4.0"

1966,"Customer service is difficult especially at branch level"," this bank is not very much fun to work for at the branch level, this position has become very sales orientated meaning that only numbers and calls matter. Work life balance leaves much to be desired by working long hours with little pay. While coworkers are fun you must stay at the position in order to move up, but once your year is up, you can only move up one career level with usually no bonus.","Branch Sales and Services Representative","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 7, 2018","2.0"

1968,"Poor leadership and a declining culture","Change in leadership have resulted in a decline in culture. Managers are no longer empowered to make decisions, as this is all run from the top of the house. If the CEO doesn't think there are enough cars in the garage, no one can work from home nay more.

1988,"Collaborative working environment with questionable leadership"," this bank has a strong culture of inclusion and collaboration. However, the lack of process and reliance on relationships as a means of getting business done is ineffective post merger with bank N. Leadership direction is unclear and often plagued with lack of prioritization. Collaborative bend has created a culture of decision (or more accurately indecision) by committee. Roles and responsibilities are not always clear, decision makers hard to identify. The organization is not nimble or fast-paced, slowed somewhat by regulatory requirements but otherwise by self-imposed bureaucracy. People are nice, willing to help - but slow to provide constructive feedback. It rates high for me personally due to work-life balance with flexibility options to meet both professional and personal needs.","Operations Group Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 1, 2018","3.0"

1990,"Avoid this place","So when I worked for them in the begining it seemed ok but for your training they send you far and the travel is a nightmare then policy and procedure seemed to change daily so forget what you learned cause it will change without notice which makes you look stupid helping the customers. They say they want to do whats right for the client when the sales goals are pushed on them so much that you are then forced to do whats not right for them just to get them off your back and to still have a job. Turn over was so high and management has favorites that when they continuously do bad they keep letting it happen. Don't expect a raise ever if your surveys aren't a perfect 5 and you must meet your ridiculous sales goals as well. No room to advance and running around for nothing and don't believe banker hours when you hear it, no such thing. Long hours and then the BM would keep you after hours and also expect you to do events and reach out as well so no work life balance whatsoever. I say keep looking and don't bother with this unprofessional place just keep clear of this place.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Batavia, IL","November 1, 2018","1.0"
1991,"I loved working for this bank","I ended up in a different office where I didn't fit in as well. But this bank as a whole is a wonderful place to work. They offer lots of help and benefits.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Saline, MI","November 1, 2018","5.0"
1992,"Stagnant and demanding work place with constantly changing expectations","Expectations and requirements frequently changing. Staffing not conducive to a successful work environment.

1993,"Professional workplace environment, lacking in employee compensation","At this position i would handle anywhere from 35-55 loan applications, assigned directly to me. I would reach out every few days to try to move the applications forward towards closing. The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing metrics our bonuses and performance was based on, and the lack of communication from management. However, the most enjoyable part was the hours and the environment. It was a very relaxed, friendly, fun environment that let you work at your own pace. Direct managers were great, upper management was the issue within our department.","Loan Process Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 31, 2018","3.0"

1995,"Good People Bad Management","Overall there are a lot of good people at this bank. Some of the higher up management doesn't have a grasp of what is actually going on. They 'sell' their new products to higher management, and bring in outside workers from prior employment to push their new products along. It's not allowing current employees a chance to learn and grow.","Systems Administrator, Senior - Team Lead","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 30, 2018","3.0"
1996,"Can be fun when your co workers knows the meaning of teamwork","I've learned that working in a bank doesn't mean glamorous, customers can still be unpredictable, 50-50 ratio of rudeness.

1997,"Enteractive with co-workers and clients","I enjoy banking for the company and assisting the customer. I work as a teller and CSR on the floor.

1998,"Great starting 9-5 job!","I worked for this bank as a teller. I learned how to manage multiple tasks at once, answer phone calls, keep up with policy changes, work with others on tasks, customer service, etc. I've learned a lot that can stat-stuff my resume for other career opportunities. You also have multiple ways to earn extra money through incentives. However, being on the frontline and having to keep up with everything I just mentioned can be a real headache at times. Multiple scenarios and tasks can be thrown at you all at once. The hardest thing for me was learning policy and procedure just for it to change as soon as you get used to it, then having to explain that to a customer. Overall, I loved my time there at this bank. (This review is through the perspective of a young adult with no kids and real responsibilities.)","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Selbyville, DE","October 29, 2018","4.0"
1999,"Freindly and competitive.","During my 16 years with this bank I felt respected for my years of experience and knowledge of the wealth management/trust business and enjoyed interacting with my co-workers on complex issues. Although competitive due to sales goals the atmosphere was always friendly. There were several department head changes during my time but fortunately they were all highly qualified individuals who knew not to micro-managers an already qualified team..","Vice President and Senior Trust Officer","Former Employee","Wilmington, DE","October 29, 2018","5.0"
