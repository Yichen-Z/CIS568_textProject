3251,"Review"," this bank was an overall good experience, however i did not like the commission structure and felt i can make more money elsewhere with my work ethic. Compensation was worth the amount of work","Merchant Account Executive","Former Employee","Fairfield, NJ","September 25, 2017","3.0"
3252,"this bank is okay"," this bank is a great company. Their pay depends on how they feel when you enter. I came in requesting a certain amount and come to find out a teller was given a higher salary than me. Mind you I had experience and management experience under my belt. The hardest thing would have to be the different policies and procedures everyday. One person says one thing and the next a different. Nothing is set in stone so it puts you at risk. I love working here because it is fast paced. They do recognize you but not as much as you would like. I love my clients at work.","Teller Supervisor","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","September 25, 2017","3.0"

3256,"mixed feelings","it's a great place to work. i feel respected, and the management (overall) is great, but the benefits suck. they do not want to pay people what they're worth. if you get an 'exceeds expectations' rating on your review, you MAYBE get a 1% raise.... if you're lucky.","Loan Analyst","Current Employee","Strip District, PA","September 24, 2017","4.0"
3257,"Can be a stressful nightmare","A typical day begins short staffed with MANY client complaints coming from neighboring branches. Branches don't work uniformly as company policy dictates and creates chaos. Computer and printing equipment constantly fails in the middle of account maintenance. HR is difficult to reach or deal with. Management is ok, ish. My personal manager is great but at times you can find no one to go to if someone has an issue above your pay grade. Security is good, if you have a trainable team. Biggest upside is vacation time, however work life balance is difficult otherwise. Typically day begins at 8:00am and many days we stay until at least 6:30pm. Sometimes we get a 30 minute break, a lot of times it's disrupted with a client issue. Many co workers are unmotivated and require daily training.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","Illinois","September 24, 2017","2.0"

Work days typical start at 8:30 and end at 5:15 unless for extenuating circumstances. upper management is good minimal micro management. hardest part of the job would be the customers at times and the employees on other occasions. I Assisted clients with achieving their financial goals or coming up with a plan of action to get to that goal.

3272,"Working at this bank","Working at this bank isn't so bad. Working a typical 8 hour day and 5 days a week is great. Also the benefits are amazing! The only thing is if you like tracking and getting micro managed by upper management then you should go for it. Other than that, helping out the customers can be very rewarding not only for yourself but also for your paycheck. Quite honestly, I don't have to much to say that would be negative to work at the branch level.","Branch Service Sales Representative","Current Employee","Saint Charles, IL","September 19, 2017","5.0"

When I started at the company , they had 4 employees (including the branch manger, assistant manager and loan officer.)

3283,"sweat shop, no care for the employee","The company lacked training and had very few managers that knew the products well enough to assist. They pushed a very heavy work load on their employees. The goals were very out of reach that very few people reached them. They kept increasing the hours. They would have us go in on Saturday too to work more and during the winter they shut of the heat. It got to the point where they were having their employees push in a code every time they left their desk such as making a copy, faxing, taking a loan to a manager, taking a file to u/w etc. It was crazy. They also wanted us to call our customer every day if we had an update or not. It got to the point our underwriters were to work 10 hours then take their computers home to work and also work the weekends. They eventually got up in droves and left 20 at a time. We had no one to underwriter our files and we were still held accountable for closing the loan.

3292,"Great company if you work in the right area","Worked for this bank in 2 different markets. The experience was night and day. In one area, there was an excellent support and development network and plenty of opportunity to move into different areas of the bank depending on individual skills and preferences. There was at minimum weekly interaction with specialty team members that handled investments, mortgages, wealth management, etc. to assist in serving the client's needs and identifying clients who would benefit from a targeted conversation with a specialist. It was possible to develop mutually beneficial relationships with the team members assigned to your branch and effectively meet client needs and generate revenue for the bank. In the other area, there was little to no support from senior leadership, inexperienced management in the branches, lack of clear communication, and no plans for expansion in a market where branches are over 2 hours from the nearest branch. The lack of branches means that each day becomes an exercise in handling complaints or cashing checks for non-customers with very little opportunity to focus on growing business. Interaction with specialty team members was non-existent. Conversations about investments, mortgages, estate planning, and more are routed through call centers and handled by indifferent team members who never meet the clients and rarely close on business. Clients would often become frustrated because there was no local investment adviser or mortgage representative to meet with and would walk out and take their business elsewhere.
