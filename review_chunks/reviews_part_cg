No work-life balance, although they try to mask it. Be sure to research any job posted for the actual job function, you may be deceived into a role as they are very 'title friendly'.

An enjoyable element of working at this bank is representing a strong and formidable brand in the financial services business. This company has a well thought out 'go to market' strategy and has developed industry vertical specialization primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, professional services and retail. As a manager, implementing strategy and being able to help develop effective tactics to do so, was also an enjoyable part of the job.","V.

I've enjoyed working with clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis. I've learned about their lives and helped make a difference in their financial well-being. The experience has reinforced my belief that organization and time management are an essential part of any business operations. Chaos in a busy environment starts from not being organized, ready to work when the day begins, and keeping track of what must be accomplished by day end. I have also learned more about what management styles I work with best. I enjoy working with individuals whom I respect and trust. I believe in treating people the way that you would be treated and being consistent with adhering to policies & procedures. In my almost 2 year tenure, the branch staff has undergone the following turnover: 2 teller supervisors, 2 branch managers, 1 assistant branch manager, 1 private client banker, 2 full time tellers (including myself), & 1 part time teller.
