There's also emphasis on growing the company while shrinking the staff - more off-shoring and pushing people out.

"Traveling RRT","They make you work 6 days a week, sometimes you're there from 8:45-6:15, absolutely insane. I was hired for the rrt position which required me to be teller and banker when needed. The virtual training was okay but then being in the branches you'd had to ask for help and sometimes other team members couldn't be bother, so would have to figure it on my own. A lot of the managers you'd meet can be very micromanage in sales. They expect you to throw a sales pitch at any client walking in. They push credit cards & loans application to clients but don't fully educate them. They also have a terrible metric system , if you are rated anything below 8, you'd have to take a class in customer service. Even if something was not your fault but is just how the client feels about youAs an rrt most of the time your manager will be the regional manager and they hardly care about you but leave it to a branch manager to give you feedback.Benefits are okay, some branches better than others, they need to stop the 6 day work week, overall a good bank if you want to get into banking.

"Not For Me","The training was promising, the person who did the virtual training was nice, was a good start. Once I got into the branch it was constant stress for laughably low pay. All the managers knew how to do was micromanage and stress you out. Also a lot of conflicting statements such as 'answer the phone' and then at another point if you answered the phone you would get in trouble. Or 'don't be afraid to ask questions!' then you'd ask a question and you'd get the equivalent of 'Google it.' Then you'd get docked for not being quick enough despite being new and having a question and having to look up the answer yourself through a large ' this bank Edge' article which takes a considerable amount of time.

Senior management tends to be heavily skewed to one particular demographic and it becomes apparent any time there's a change broached, such as updating WFH policies (although the pandemic has changed some of that). Insurance options stink and you have to fight for every raise you get. Management would rather give one-time performance bonuses rather than a meaningful salary increase. It is embarrassing to work for a company that pulls in billions in profit every year and then I have to tell my staff they're getting a 1.2% raise.That being said, some managers (particularly the younger ones) are excellent and understand the value of providing employees the space to do their jobs without micromanaging.

They want you to think they are growing with this new bank B merger but they are constantly closing and consolidating branches, loosing employees, and falling short on sales goals across multiple markets... so let's list some things they don't want you to know.*There is NO work life balance. Several college students or young mothers have quit for this very reason. Hours have been extended during the week and weekend hours. under-staffing (a common theme here, sorry) has put a great strain on branches, Over-Time has not been approved so with extended hours we have to shave even more time off of our schedules which leaves the under-staffed that much more strained. Our customers also do not care for the new hours as they regularly are upset with us Saturday mornings as they have been waiting an hour for us to open and people really don't come after 12 on Saturdays or 5 during the week and most days after 4 it is dead.

"You are expendable ","The best way that I can describe my experience with this bank (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly.The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that they become exempt). Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in.The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year. If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition.The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input. Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems.

Aside from that, HR is a complete mess and will not help you with actually bad things (I.e. harassment) and turnover is high because all the wrong people are promoted (but hey, at least they can open 12 different checking accounts for the same person, not everyone can pull blood from a stone). I did learn a lot in a short amount of time but that's really only because I'm self-motivated and a quick-learner; in my first year, my manager ran through literally 4 different new hires because: 1) they personally were very difficult to work for 2) had very high expectations and 3) wanted to put absolutely NO effort into helping to train the new people. I know there are a few good managers that work for this bank, but honestly do yourself a favor and go into this job either knowing you're in it only for the resume experience or that you're okay with being an over glorified ATM that's expected to try to sell a credit card to every person you talk to in a given day.

I was ready to leave after the first month. The women that worked there never smiled and were just down right miserable. The tellers and the management. I don't believe anyone there actually like to help people at all. They took the call blocking very serious. They used it as a second lunch break.

"Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised","Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality. The faster you work, the more praise you get. In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct. If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on. Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for it not to be able to be finalized. This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since it was pushed back to accommodate other rush files. Those that fly through their files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par. Pay is not competitive with other banks, even though this bank is the fifth largest bank, they still refuse to offer a decent pay, especially for the amount of stress the job causes. this bank prides themselves on inclusion and diversity but I did not feel or see that while working here. In my experience, trying to move around in the company is a hassle. I tried to get off the team I was on several times, applying for different positions and was always told they are on a hiring freeze. The only positive I can say is the remote work. Other than that be prepared to be stressed out, over worked and underpaid.","Loan Closing Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 10, 2021","2.0"

"Overall good workplace but management and scheduling improvements needed...","With this bank work life balance, it's important to understand each branch is different according to the manager. Some managers understand that work is work and there is some form of life outside of this bank so they'll stick to the 8 - 5 schedule; however, others do not. There is a lot of scheduling outside of typical 8-5 hours, for example rotating every other Friday until 6:15pm and then Saturdays quarterly. I can count on more hands than two the times I've had to stay late, come in early, or be sent to another branch over 25+ minutes away to help out at a moment's notice just in two months time. These requests disrupt the work-life balance because you basically cannot expect to get to any other commitment (daycare, appointment, etc) on time once you leave the office because you won't leave the office on time. Honestly, if we could get out the door according to schedule, the work-life balance would be great. When it comes to compensation/benefits, there's a lot of murkiness. You're asked to train two to four people and pick up slack in a short staffed branch because you've done such an outstanding job in your current role, but come annual review time your raise will not even be enough to make a noticeable difference. They will keep piling the additional responsibilities on to you but not compensate you for it. I believe my pay check's taxes for one pay period was more than my most recent raise for the whole entire year. This seems a little confusing as usually commended performance is compensated fairly and a 'Meets or Exceeds Expectations' rating should be a valid defense for at least - more...","Branch Banker","Current Employee","Huntsville, AL","September 8, 2021","2.0"

"The worst bank to work for","I worked here for less than 3 months. Management is terrible, with little to no support and they expect you to train, hit your goals, and do daily outbound calls all in 1-2 months and show numbers or else they threaten your job security. Mind you training takes up almost 1.5 months and most of your day.

"Not the Bank for career moves","Every morning, I'd wake up and dread coming to work when I was an RRT. You never know which branch you'd go to for the day. Sales goals were attainable, but it is a 'what have you done for me lately' environment so things did not matter from yesterday. Not much in terms of PTO, lower side of 401(k) employer match, and even worse pay. Bonus structure was alright, but if you don't hit a specific threshold, then you could forget about any bonus. Immediate Branch Management was ok, they picked favorites, but would not really play favoritism. Upper Management is trash and would not care if you got hit by a car, just as long as you hit your goals to so they could pack their bank accounts. Covid made things worse branch employees, no raises, and if we had symptoms we were forced to use our own time to stay home, which is not really fair.

However, the upper management shows little regard for employees well-being. 401k match is 4 percent which is nice. 3 weeks vacation time and 5 sick day per year plus federal holidays off. That being said, the hourly wage at this bank is lower than most every other bank. Minimum wage here is $15.00 an hour VS the competitors starting at $18.00. The commission structure for the bankers is difficult to understand and does not pay out well even when exceeding goals.

The system wasn't communicating correctly with other systems. We were also dealing with lawyers calling in asking about these accounts. So it was a big mess. We were put on live calls fumbling our way through trying to please the customers and lawyers calling in. We were advised to take messages and someone would call them back with the information you are requesting or an answer to your question. No one called them back so we would get another call from the lawyer or customer fuming as no one has gotten back with them. Horrible stressful work environment. After dealing with this mess I left the bank after working there for 13 years. We got paid incentive for the dollars we collected on but if you were doing your job correctly and helping customers. You were on the bottom of collection $$ because you spent your day dealing with calls. It was pitting all employees against each other and not helpful to any this bank customer.

A few months later, 30% of my department's processes were automated, leaving a great deal less work to spread around.

It a a very strict call center environment with calls non-stop which means bathroom breaks are limited to two 15 minutes and only a 30 minute lunch. As stressful as this position is due to branch employees rude outbursts more is needed.

"After working there over 12 years, I was let go after a medical disability leave.","Wonderful experience the first ten years working there. Then my management changed. The next boss was nonexistent as a manager; never treated me kindly or fairly. Then my job was 'eliminated' and I found an opening in another department. That department was not a good fit and had a different culture than what I was used to. I then had a medical condition arise quite suddenly, and was on LTD for a while. After being released, I was given a specific amount of time to find another internal position - at the ONSET of Covid spreading all over the country. There were no internal jobs posted for my experience level or office position, so I was let go after the number of days allotted for me to obtain a new job. I once loved working there, was proud of my employer and worked my butt off on many nights & weekends to meet deadlines, I had fantastic bosses (except the last one) and was very disappointed at not being able to continue my employment. Other than that, good company.","Several Positions","Former Employee","Columbus, OH","July 20, 2021","3.0"

"-0- work/life balance","Senior management says one thing and does another. Too much pressure to achieve goals causing employees to become product pushers- much the same as Wells Fargo.

"Low pay, lacks motivation ","The pay is very low for the amount of work you're expected to do. Walmart and Burger King pays more so that should be a red flag. Also, the bank has this survey system which is barbaric in rating its employees. That is, if you get a 9 out of 10 you're an under-performing employee. It is extremely demotivating and addressing it with management is practically useless. You're basically told you need to get over it. My experience there wasn't a good one. The daily stress isn't worth the lack of compensation and the lack of motivation and purpose doesn't make it much better. ","Teller","Former Employee","Lancaster, PA","July 11, 2021","2.0"

"A hot mess"," this bank does not know how to manage their size and their volume of business. Since before I started there has been mandatory OT and application dates that are months old leaving us with highly upset customers and rushing to clean up the mess all the while using the phrase 'business as usual'. Upper management comes up with 'fixes' but has no idea what the day to day role is and continue to make the job increasingly more difficult. Before I started someone that did not work for this bank said they heard it was a sweat shop and honestly that is a good description. OT is mandatory and the only way to possibly meet management demands. Good for the paycheck, but for quality of life. this bank also recently made the change that employees can roll over 3 vacation days. After two years, employees previously could buy an additional week of vacation but with the 3 day rollover, employees now only have the option to buy 2 days, reducing the number of days employees can take off each year.","Loan Processing Analyst","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 7, 2021","2.0"

"A Job","It was a job and that is about it. Management was overly stressed. Bankers had very high unattainable goals. Constantly feeling pressured to make a sale even if it is not what is best for the customer. Typical day would be morning meeting at 8:15am. This was semi nice discussing what would occur for the day and everyone would say a goal for the day also. Then go to my desk and log in to my systems/ check emails. Wait for customers to come in to provide service or lobby engage by standing in the lobby and directing customers to either a teller, banker, or manager. While at your desk you are expected to document each interaction as well as have one sales conversation. This company is only good to work for if you are extremely money driven.","Personal Banker","Former Employee","Penn Hills, PA","July 6, 2021","3.0"

"Competitive","The work is not bad. The good: They provide good training and good benefits. I enjoyed helping my customers and recommending products that best fit their needs. Job work balance was good. The bad: Very stressful. Competitive to the point of cutthroat as bankers job is measured by their metrics on how many products they sell in a quarter. This creates a less than desirable work culture in which you have to watch your back at every turn. I had some of my work 'stolen' by a coworker and my manager assigned my leads to her, she was my senior. Lunch is 30 minutes and you may have a 10 minute break if it's not too busy. Lots of negativity and fake people. HR sucks and will not help you if you place a complaint. Unfortunately, it was too much for me and I happily quit. The job itself was a great experience.

"A life of busy work","A typical day at work: Log in. Join MS Teams. Engage in work/life related banter all day. Each person handles their assigned tasks. Skype Meetings. Log out. Repeat the next day.What you learned: * I learned that Midwest culture in the work place is very NOT diverse. * When working remotely, the best way to feel like you are a part of the this bank family, is to go into a local branch and build relations with them. At least then you won't feel so apart.Management: Like anywhere, some are good, some are bad. Probably the worse part is the deluge of paperwork and processes that change weekly. Its like work for the sake of work. Whenever someone comes up with a procedure, they just make a new rule and even if that impacts some other process, so what.","Vice President","Current Employee","Washington, DC","June 26, 2021","4.0"
"Overworked and Underpaid","I strongly recommend not working on the retail end. The sales goals are unreal and unrealistic and the pay out is terrible. You have to do so much selling and only to get a few hundred dollars of pay out, which is only quarterly. Most of the branches close at 6, so that means you work 8:30am-6pm most days. They also don't pay you anything, no matter the experience you have. At most you will make $42K if you go into a branch as a banker and you have to fight tooth and nail for that. Turnover is extremely high. It's also hard to get days off, and don't even think about asking for a Friday or Monday off. It will be very hard to get, and they will give you the biggest guilt trip if you want either day off. Overall, unless you just really need a job, do not work at this bank on the retail side.

Be prepared to be lectured every 5 mins about why you're not meeting your numbers. Constant micromanagement and badgering. Benefits are really good, but that's about it. Loved my co workers as well.

"They try to come off as 'different' but they are just like ever other bank","Working for this bank is inconsistent , they treat some branches much better then others . For example the branches in more impoverished areas have far less technology and the branches aren't as kept up as the more wealthy areas. Working for this bank is like working for any other bank. It has its ups and downs . Your overall enjoyment while with the company varies depending on the manager. One of the major drawbacks for working for this company is how they draw you in because of there status as one of the largest banks in the country but at the end of the day they pay like a small town credit union. Most employees with children have to work part time jobs to make ends meet because this bank refuse to accommodate financially according to the times . Just like any other major financial institution you can go from being the top of the company in sales one month to literally getting fired the next. They are very strict on how they want things done , even if you have a different way that works for you they want it done 'there way'. Overall this company is a bunch of malarkey and filled with false promises . They are just like every other bank . Actually who am i kidding they are worse then other banks . Others banks close between 4:30-5pm this bank decided to close at 6 pm but yet and still they post on the digital screens in branches about promoting a work to life balance .

Management most recently was very unsupportive and exclusionary, especially with respect to individual employee special needs and medical conditions. Oftentimes, I found management to be disregarding, with a negative attitude regarding my experience and my advanced educational level (M.Ed.. + Ph.D. program ABD).at times, it seemed that jealously and a desire to be secretive regarding management's motives and actions was definitely part of the work culture. Openness of management is talked about, but not truly part of the work experience especially in recent years. The most enjoyable part of the job was the (limited) ability to interact with other employees that became my friends and supports. The hardest part of the job was the negativity, unattainable productivity emphasis, lack of openness and truthfulness,and lack of support from the management team, particularly in the area where I worked prior to leaving my position.","Quality Assurance Coordinator","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","June 16, 2021","1.0"
