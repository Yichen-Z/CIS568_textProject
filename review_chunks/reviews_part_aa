"Great place to work for most","I have really enjoyed working here, the only issue is in career advancement. There are some traditional routes that work for some, but anything outside the norm is extremely difficult no matter what level of performance or participation you have.","Branch Sales and Service Associate II","Current Employee","Ann Arbor, MI","March 27, 2019","4.0"
"It's a job","You go in five days a week do what you need to then leave, the employees are jerks, and the manager does nothing to keep them from being one. If the employees were more respectful it would be a decent place to work.","Cook","Current Employee","San Antonio, TX","June 2, 2022","3.0"
"Stressful","Banking as a whole has become an awful industry to work in. Large corporations still using old school tactics to bring in sales. Corporate yuppies don't understand that pounding pavement to attract sales is not an effective sales method. Furthermore, the manager is tied up in meetings all day that get in the way of managing, which leaves little time to get anything done. ","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Florida","June 1, 2022","2.0"
"Micromanaged and very little room for growth","I worked for this bank for about 10 years and every stop was a non existent budget for raises, positions that continue to expand with compensation to match. Find a better company if growth and development are your thing.","Executive Client Relations","Former Employee","OH","June 1, 2022","3.0"
"Stressful environment ","Core service consultant. This place is essentially a phone factory where management offers little assistance and expects associates to take back to back phone calls all day.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","June 1, 2022","1.0"
"Productive ","It is a good place to work with management who cares to see you succeed. Some banks micro manage but this one doesn't. this bank also really cares about your benefits ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Dallas, TX","May 30, 2022","5.0"
"Every year they cut your pay","Every year they expect you to work 20% harder for 20% less. There is no future of growth for you as an MLO. Management makes poor decisions, but you as the employee shoulder the burden for it. They don't hire the staff when the market is hot, and they then overcompensate by hiring too much, and don't see the market changing. Currently, their idea of fixing the market downturn is for you to call dead end phone numbers of existing customers in their data base. Then the Master Plan is to automate MLOs out of their jobs as much as possible to assure future cuts in MLO pay.","Sr Mortgage Loan Originator","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","May 29, 2022","2.0"
"I learned a lot on the job It was a good experience."," Working the evening shift was a plus for me at the time I worked in their corporate office working on various bank documents. This helped me learn more about how the banking business worked, more about how checks and other items were recorded and verified. I learned how the bank process is handled. I had no problem with My manager or supervisor. The workplace was culture. The job was easy nothing was hard about the Job. Working as a team player and keeping busy.

"I have a lot to say about this company but it's pointless …","poor management and your work like balance is never going to be 'a balance ' but I'm just one person but this bank isn't all bad /amazing benefit are good .","Teller Representative","Current Employee","Port Saint Lucie, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
"Worst place to work","No work life balance. Outdated systems. Extreme Micromanaging. They watch you by cameras and then open investigations based on assumptions. You don't have control over your branch and no ability to waive fees for good clients! If you need to step out of the branch and have worked over 40 hours they still make you use your occasional absence! The Regional Manager could not even understand that goes against Florida Law! this bank wants you to just be a micromanaging robot! Clients are just another person and they say they are about relationship building but their actions do not show it! I received a job offer for 20k more with a much better Financial Institution that truly values their employees and clients! ","Sr Branch Manager","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
"It'll do, but it kind of sucks","When I started at this bank I was really excited and energized. I had heard a lot about the opportunities this bank offers. That part is true, they have a lot of different departments you can train in and growth opportunities. The downside is you do have to stay an entire year in your current position before you can apply for a different one. So if you hate the area you're working in you better be able to suck it up for 12 months. They do their best to have life/work balance and are big on employees quality of life. However, if you work in a physical branch, you will not be trained. I moved from the care center to the branch and was put in an office for 4 months to train myself. I made countless mistakes every single day due to lack of resources and training. They use outdated software that is extremely hard to navigate and crashes constantly. I got fired for something small, it was my fault, but a writeup may have been a good first step as I had never had a red mark. The people I worked with were great but you could tell how much they hated their jobs. The end of my career with this bank I was extremely burned out and stressed. If you want to be overworked and work 6 days a week twice a month, this bank would be for you. ","Banker","Former Employee","Paw Paw, MI","May 26, 2022","2.0"
"Productive, inclusive but lacks work life balance","Everyone does their share here although some managers believe in micromanaging. You only have to stay in each position for a year and you can move around and apply for a new position as much as you would like. My only 2 complaints are with the pay; while they increased the base pay for all positions, positions like tellers supervisors and people who are both bankers and tellers have sales requirements but receive no sales pay. Also the hours are getting worse it makes work life balance hard for those who have small children. Maternity, 401k, stock options, and tuition reimbursement along with other benefits are great.","Lead Teller","Current Employee","Delaware","May 26, 2022","3.0"
"It was okay. ","Okay place to work at. Seems like all they cared about was sales. It paid the bills. Work life balance was okay. Not a job I was completely thrilled about. ","Service Representative","Former Employee","Gloucester City, NJ","May 26, 2022","3.0"
"Don't work here","I have been with the company for 6 months and been without a manager for 5 months. I have to learn the banks systems by myself with no help from upper management. Don't waste your time with this company. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Asheville, NC","May 26, 2022","1.0"
"Micromanage and demeaning ","Worked here for 3 months as a Sales Rep because that's all I could take. Managers micromanage you. You can't even go to the bathroom. If you do, they'll ask where you were for so long (3-10 mins). I remember during training, someone asked are we allowed to take a break to go to the bathroom. One supervisor said do it on your scheduled break time. Taking calls back to back with people screaming at you and they don't let you take a break to decompress from it. This place is horrible for your mental, physical and emotional health","Sales Associate","Former Employee","Remote","May 25, 2022","1.0"

"They 'customer service' their own employees","The pay is nice however the stress is almost not worth it. Half the time you don't even know who your manager is. They are getting so big that they can't properly service their employees and you just get pushed around. I've heard that they will escalate issues too many times and nothing is ever done. ","Customer Care Center Rep","Current Employee","Frankenmuth, MI","May 23, 2022","1.0"
"You are just an underpaid Robot","They expect the world, with repetitive, duplicate documentation using sub standard computer systems that are always crashing. No work/life balance unless you are Management. They feel that they can command your life 24/7. Schedules set, but that is all fake since once you plan on the schedule set for you, they change it at a moment's notice despite anything you may have planned. If you refuse to 'fill in', they lump you as a non-team player. Management commits you to work areas and times they have not asked you ahead of time. Lunches are always interrupted, so if you want to have the time you are allowed, you have to actually leave the premises and turn off your phone.","Service Associate","Former Employee","Maryland","May 23, 2022","1.0"
"Company seems great, but my branch wasn't. ","I had high hopes with this bank. Poor management within my branch contributed to a terrible work environment. Too much gossip about new people.

"Stressful place to work . Over worked and undervalued ","You are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated at all. Management is terribly and there is always miscommunication between managers.

"Pay is good ","It a ok company to work for but they are not organized I wish it stayed bank B because once it become this bank they changed a lot but the pay is better I will say that's the only thing that's better than bank B ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Birmingham, AL","May 22, 2022","3.0"
"No Comment ","Typical Banking profit over people mentality. Better you do the more overwhelmed other areas are and then leads to great worker morale. On top of that the better one does the more incentive one makes but less they have to dole out for next quarterly making it harder to make said goals.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 21, 2022","2.0"
"The bank of the past"," this bank tries so hard to be a bank of the future but has terrible systems in place filled with service issues. Multiple locations have gone cashless yet atm always have service issues, new system still has a lot of bugs to work out and staffing is always a problem due to a high turnover rate. They expect you to drive sales but do not properly train you or give you proper product knowledge. The variety in products/ services is not competitive enough with the market and customer service department is even long wait times for the internal lines. The check in process for clients is completely awful and most customers complain about it yet it is enforced tremendously.Management gets to do whatever they want and regional manager doesn't really care about what's actually going on in the branches. This is a great place to work if you like to be swamped with clients and have a bunch of meaningless tasks to complete you barely have time to do.","Universal Banker","Former Employee","Virginia Beach, VA","May 19, 2022","2.0"
"Got me through Covid, But still not satisfactory ","I'm grateful to this bank for getting me and my family through covid, and the benefits ( HSA, PARENTAL LEAVE, VACATION ) are nice, but ultimately due to some poor changes in incentives, branch hours, staffing and pay, i wouldn't call this bank a great company to work for. ","Branch Banker and Sales Associate","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 18, 2022","2.0"
"Good Start to banking career, burned out quickly ","Great place to learn and start your bank career. Lots of support from team members if you needed it. Downside was politics and playing favorites which I feel is most bank culture at the branch level.

"Branch Manager ","1) Overworked, expected to work 6 days a week, work life balance is a joke in retail banking. 2) Sales quota doesn't reflect branch location and traffic. this bank approval criteria for lending services is extremely rigid, that doesn't work in a low to meditate income area. In addition managers have to drive small business in addition to other duties. 3) operations is outdated! Complete waste of productivity.

"Great company, poor senior managers"," this bank (mortgage) is an all right company to work for. I love that they promote working remotely, and so far all of my direct managers have been great! However, my senior managers have not been. They only care about reports and numbers, and not the actual employee. If you're blessed to work here & have a great frontline a manger then you'll be fine. Oh yea, getting hired on is like you're working for the FBI. The hiring process is strenuous and doesn't even align with the job and environment of the company.","Loan Processor","Current Employee","Remo","May 16, 2022","3.0"

"Good place to work ","If you can self manage while working from home, you can be very successful. However, if you can't, then you will fail rather quickly.

"Great place to work if you are hard working","I have been at this bank for only 2 months but I can confidently tell you it's a great place to work. They actively look to promote from within, as well as they are incredibly supportive. It is FAST PACED LEARNING so be prepared for that. If you get overwhelmed, tell your mentors, they are incredible and want you to succeed. I happen to work very late hours and I didn't feel that was significantly expressed to me when I accepted the job, but the pay and benefits outweigh the unfortunate working hours.

"Micromanaging, no work life balance","Branch manager role. Micromanagement to the core. Report after report of things you aren't doing correctly. Audits are conducted through the cameras. Absolutely no cell phone tolerance. Branch managers are business bankers- cold calls to prospect businesses and held accountable for achieving business goals alone (no bankers open business accounts) and held accountable for achieving consumer side as well. Incentive pay out only happens when 50% of your bankers achieve their goals, not if the branch is 100% or above or if you achieve the business goal that you are held personally accountable for. under-staffed and no applicants. Expected to conduct weekly meetings with every employee to touch base their goals - with no staff. Depending on branch size, bankers expected to call 800+ calls to consumers and branch managers expected to conduct consumer and business calls to be at target. this bank is in the middle of switching programs to make it 'easier' - it's not. Expected to have 5 star customer service, write monthly action plans, and call surveys conducted on the branch for feedback and now additional calls to bad surveys to be invited back to be surveyed again. Phones must be answered on 3rd ring, even in front of clients at your station, expected to deliver offers to the client in the same interaction while delivering exceptional customer service, within a 'timely' (2 minute) manner. Corporate drives through your branches drive thru's and times their wait time while surprise visiting your branch. Anyway, good benefits.

"Poor Retail Lending leadership has led to a mass exodus of top talent. No signs of improvement. ","Since the current leadership in the Retail Lending business has taken over the business environment has suffered greatly. The majority of the experienced product management talent have all left over the last year as a result of poor leadership and recent leadership decisions have made thing worse, especially in the card business.

"Do not take FA job at the branch","Bankers and tellers are forced to provide you with so call referrals. 99% are bad, so they can get management off their backs.

"Used to be decent, now a total nightmare ","Managers do not care about you, they treat you as a number. Compensation for goals were taken away yet you are still demanded to meet those goals.

"Retail Lending business environment continues to suffer under current leadership team (Especially in Card) ","Over the past 3-4 years the work environment in this bank's retail lending world has suffered greatly due to it's ineffective leadership team. As a result the work environment has become toxic, especially in card for both the product team and business partners. Lack of leadership experience, poor strategic vision and the careless approach to managing employee relations and growth has lead to a mass exodus of much of the top talent.

"Great Culture","Good Company with great benefits. They offer competitive healthcare, and both 401K & Pension. However they are little conservative on the base pay scale, as competitors offer more. Because their base pay is low, their incentive program is really great, as top producers can earn a lot. The drawback to that is that you loose a lot of new employees to competitors because it usually take a while to get your self establish and start performing at a high level to get the big incentives.

Worst part is daily reports about how you take too long by so-many-seconds on average, per call. You just have to enjoy helping people and realize you're doing just fine.

"I used to love this job, but things have gotten tough.","I started at this bank a few years ago and moved up pretty quickly after snagging a few promotions. I used to love this job, but find it getting harder everyday to get up and do my best. I feel like since the merger in 2021, we've been on a very difficult path to recovery and not much is being done to help the front line staff answering customer questions and complaints. We went from being busy (1-2 minute call wait times) to exceptionally busy (customers are waiting 30 minutes to an hour before an agent is able to help). Since the turn of the year, this has not been getting better. this bank has tried to help some of these people by raising the minimum wage company-wide. While that did help some newer people, a lot of us got stuck with little to nothing in terms of a rate increase. While it MAY get back to normal in the next few months it has been pretty terrible from October 2021 to the current date.

"The this bank Board needs to reexamine the Leadership!"," this bank has turned management into a team of babysitters that only recognize what the team is doing wrong. Never a 'good job' or 'great progress' and more importantly 'THANK YOU'. Leaders address those who are not performing individually. I am sick of hearing how the team failed when I meet all of my goals! The majority of people are working long hours, training is practically non-existent or sporadic at best, we are told to reduce errors and take our time and the next day to pick up extra work and get it done faster (while constantly training due to turnover because we have no formal department training program). Can't you manage the company while retaining and keeping your employees semi-happy at their workplace? Also, it is sickening to read what the Executives receive in yearly stock options/bonuses, your yearly salary is already more than my whole department combined! I understand the dynamics and responsibilities on your shoulders but you have turned extremely greedy while watching the staff figure out how they are going to feed their family/or pay for parking on their meager salary. I will obtain my degree in 2 months, I doubt my manager even remembers, and like some others, I am looking for a job that appreciates and rewards me for my work ethic and loyalty as well as my desire to assist others while independently striving to grow myself.

Each year I have seen more than 40% of teams turning over and spent a significant amount of work time recruiting for open roles. However once we get people hired, often we don't have work for them to do or they end up with busy work that isn't challenging. this bank isn't a culture where business results are prioritized enough, doing work tasks and having meetings is and the result is that they're falling behind in offering modern customer experiences. I am really disappointed in my experience, I expected to learn and grow and what I found is that management doesn't take the talent they have seriously.","Senior Strategy Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","March 12, 2022","2.0"
"Fast paced but monotonous ","My role as a teller is fast paced, the branch is very busy. Management feels out of touch with teller needs. The schedule changes daily and you're frequently stuck working beyond your scheduled shift time but even when you give advanced notice that you need a day off management makes you feel like it's a big deal and doesn't seem to want to work with you. Customers are super mean to new employees who are trying to follow policy for protecting customer accounts. The pay is higher than anywhere else in the area, and they do offer benefits, vacation time, sick time, etc. I would say this bank is a good company, there's plenty opportunities for growth, but I don't believe in my current branch that I have the tools I need to be successful and I don't want to stay long term.

"Conversion Nightmare","As a former bank B employee of 10+ years, I was very happy. When this bank bought out bank B I was hesitant but excited for something new. This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed. The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform their jobs efficiently. I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off. The job roles we were placed into did not align with prior roles and responsibilities. The stress level is unreal. Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress. Imagine starting a new job as a banker. You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and procedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat. Not one person knows these new systems and it's time to open the doors on a Monday. You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to. That want to service accounts but you don't know how. That truly need you to help them but you can't. That is what this process is like. My advice, stay away until they figure out. 5 months in and there are still so many issues to resolve. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Georgetown, TX","March 8, 2022","1.0"

"Terrible Onboarding/Training experience ","Minimal training provided in a group virtual setting. The people in my group were hired for business banking and they definitely didn't seem qualified. Most didn't pay attention and were super disrespectful to the trainer. They couldn't grasp most of it and only 2 weeks of training they put you on the phone all but yourself before you even know how to use the systems and tell you to figure it out. Their 'in the moment support' requires you to wait long periods of time for someone to get to you which leaves the customer on hold forever and creates a terrible customer and agent experience. In the moment they have no time to explain what they tell you to do and you can't stop taking calls to ask. The calls are back to back with no break to document or look around. As soon as the client hangs another is in your ear. Craziest experience I've ever had. I've always been a top agent working virtually in customer service and NEVER seen anything like this.

Great, but when my performance review came, I was denied an increase since I had already reached the 75% percentile, and regardless of my job performance I was already earning the maximum allowed. Their salary was not competitive at all.They also ended up closing a lot of offices in the area within a few years of the acquisition.

"Trained for one job but ended up doing a different job","This company literally set me up for failure. I was supposed be crossed trained on multiple jobs but was only allowed to be a teller, so I never was allowed to put the training in to use, therefore the rare times I was allowed to do my actual job, I had no hands on experience. The company puts great emphasis on selling products to get commissions, which caused an environment that was overly competitive and coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission would not let me train because they did not want me to get the commission and/or credit for the 'sale'. The environment was hostile, especially at certain offices. (I was a floater) I was there for 2 years and was very unhappy for the most part. The teller training was great, but there was a lot of overnight travel, usually for a week at a time, but the hotels were nice so if you like that kind of traveling it's nice.

"N/a"," this bank has great benefits, the compensation isn't really great. You have a great work life balance. There isn't B really much room for growth. I did enjoy working with my coworkers, they were all pretty nice. You could use it as a stepping stone. The work wasn't very complicated & the manager is super nice. Overall this bank was a great experience for me. ","Operations Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 1, 2021","5.0"
"Not For Me","The training was promising, the person who did the virtual training was nice, was a good start. Once I got into the branch it was constant stress for laughably low pay. All the managers knew how to do was micromanage and stress you out. Also a lot of conflicting statements such as 'answer the phone' and then at another point if you answered the phone you would get in trouble. Or 'don't be afraid to ask questions!' then you'd ask a question and you'd get the equivalent of 'Google it.' Then you'd get docked for not being quick enough despite being new and having a question and having to look up the answer yourself through a large ' this bank Edge' article which takes a considerable amount of time. I felt as I was absolutely set up to fail here, was not worth the stress, not worth the pay, and not worth having to work mostly 10 hour days.

"Good and bad","I am a long-time employee so I've seen the good and the bad from this company. Senior management tends to be heavily skewed to one particular demographic and it becomes apparent any time there's a change broached, such as updating WFH policies (although the pandemic has changed some of that). Insurance options stink and you have to fight for every raise you get. Management would rather give one-time performance bonuses rather than a meaningful salary increase. It is embarrassing to work for a company that pulls in billions in profit every year and then I have to tell my staff they're getting a 1.2% raise.That being said, some managers (particularly the younger ones) are excellent and understand the value of providing employees the space to do their jobs without micromanaging. The company has made a huge push to increase D&I conversations and is making meaningful investments in the community.","Risk Management","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 25, 2021","3.0"

Which is why so many people are leaving. They want you to think they are growing with this new bank B merger but they are constantly closing and consolidating branches, loosing employees, and falling short on sales goals across multiple markets... so let's list some things they don't want you to know.*There is NO work life balance. Several college students or young mothers have quit for this very reason. Hours have been extended during the week and weekend hours. under-staffing (a common theme here, sorry) has put a great strain on branches, Over-Time has not been approved so with extended hours we have to shave even more time off of our schedules which leaves the under-staffed that much more strained. Our customers also do not care for the new hours as they regularly are upset with us Saturday mornings as they have been waiting an hour for us to open and people really don't come after 12 on Saturdays or 5 during the week and most days after 4 it is dead.

The day to day hugely depends on the immediate team and manager. I had a fantastic one! But it varies greatly based on my conversations with coworkers.

"You are expendable ","The best way that I can describe my experience with this bank (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly.The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that they become exempt). Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in.The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year. If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition.The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input. Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems. Mistakes are made often because many people have no idea what they're doing (through no fault of their own).","Loan Research Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 23, 2021","2.0"
"Imagine all of the bad/toxic managers you've ever had to work with all working in leadership positions at the same company","You are actively encouraged to saddle individuals with banking products they don't need and if you are not cut-throat enough to sell a drowning man even more debt your other talents will not be appreciated. Aside from that, HR is a complete mess and will not help you with actually bad things (I.e. harassment) and turnover is high because all the wrong people are promoted (but hey, at least they can open 12 different checking accounts for the same person, not everyone can pull blood from a stone). I did learn a lot in a short amount of time but that's really only because I'm self-motivated and a quick-learner; in my first year, my manager ran through literally 4 different new hires because: 1) they personally were very difficult to work for 2) had very high expectations and 3) wanted to put absolutely NO effort into helping to train the new people. I know there are a few good managers that work for this bank, but honestly do yourself a favor and go into this job either knowing you're in it only for the resume experience or that you're okay with being an over glorified ATM that's expected to try to sell a credit card to every person you talk to in a given day.

I don't believe anyone there actually like to help people at all. They took the call blocking very serious. They used it as a second lunch break.

","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","September 11, 2021","5.0"
"Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised","Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality. The faster you work, the more praise you get. In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct. If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on. Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for it not to be able to be finalized. This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since it was pushed back to accommodate other rush files. Those that fly through their files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par. Pay is not competitive with other banks, even though this bank is the fifth largest bank, they still refuse to offer a decent pay, especially for the amount of stress the job causes. this bank prides themselves on inclusion and diversity but I did not feel or see that while working here. In my experience, trying to move around in the company is a hassle. I tried to get off the team I was on several times, applying for different positions and was always told they are on a hiring freeze. The only positive I can say is the remote work. Other than that be prepared to be stressed out, over worked and underpaid.","Loan Closing Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 10, 2021","2.0"

"Overall good workplace but management and scheduling improvements needed...","With this bank work life balance, it's important to understand each branch is different according to the manager. Some managers understand that work is work and there is some form of life outside of this bank so they'll stick to the 8 - 5 schedule; however, others do not. There is a lot of scheduling outside of typical 8-5 hours, for example rotating every other Friday until 6:15pm and then Saturdays quarterly. I can count on more hands than two the times I've had to stay late, come in early, or be sent to another branch over 25+ minutes away to help out at a moment's notice just in two months time. These requests disrupt the work-life balance because you basically cannot expect to get to any other commitment (daycare, appointment, etc) on time once you leave the office because you won't leave the office on time. Honestly, if we could get out the door according to schedule, the work-life balance would be great. When it comes to compensation/benefits, there's a lot of murkiness. You're asked to train two to four people and pick up slack in a short staffed branch because you've done such an outstanding job in your current role, but come annual review time your raise will not even be enough to make a noticeable difference. They will keep piling the additional responsibilities on to you but not compensate you for it. I believe my pay check's taxes for one pay period was more than my most recent raise for the whole entire year. This seems a little confusing as usually commended performance is compensated fairly and a 'Meets or Exceeds Expectations' rating should be a valid defense for at least - more...","Branch Banker","Current Employee","Huntsville, AL","September 8, 2021","2.0"

"Not the Bank for career moves","Every morning, I'd wake up and dread coming to work when I was an RRT. You never know which branch you'd go to for the day. Sales goals were attainable, but it is a 'what have you done for me lately' environment so things did not matter from yesterday. Not much in terms of PTO, lower side of 401(k) employer match, and even worse pay. Bonus structure was alright, but if you don't hit a specific threshold, then you could forget about any bonus. Immediate Branch Management was ok, they picked favorites, but would not really play favoritism. Upper Management is trash and would not care if you got hit by a car, just as long as you hit your goals to so they could pack their bank accounts. Covid made things worse branch employees, no raises, and if we had symptoms we were forced to use our own time to stay home, which is not really fair.

"Opportunities for advancement are great, Pay... not so much. "," this bank is an okay company to work for. If you are looking to learn the basics of banking, it is a good place to start. However, the upper management shows little regard for employees well-being. 401k match is 4 percent which is nice. 3 weeks vacation time and 5 sick day per year plus federal holidays off. That being said, the hourly wage at this bank is lower than most every other bank. Minimum wage here is $15.00 an hour VS the competitors starting at $18.00. The commission structure for the bankers is difficult to understand and does not pay out well even when exceeding goals. They took away commission opportunities for tellers which has negatively impacted the moral. Also, this bank likes to change their technology frequently which is stressful for the employees.

"workplace culture","I loved my Job in Recovery. But the bank decided that we needed to collect on any account in recovery. So they gave us old Home loans that were charged off for years. this bank gave us one hour training to learn a new system to collect the payments on. The system wasn't communicating correctly with other systems. We were also dealing with lawyers calling in asking about these accounts. So it was a big mess. We were put on live calls fumbling our way through trying to please the customers and lawyers calling in. We were advised to take messages and someone would call them back with the information you are requesting or an answer to your question. No one called them back so we would get another call from the lawyer or customer fuming as no one has gotten back with them. Horrible stressful work environment. After dealing with this mess I left the bank after working there for 13 years. We got paid incentive for the dollars we collected on but if you were doing your job correctly and helping customers. You were on the bottom of collection $$ because you spent your day dealing with calls. It was pitting all employees against each other and not helpful to any this bank customer.

A few months later, 30% of my department's processes were automated, leaving a great deal less work to spread around.

Yet that want you to give them yo vacation time by end of January like year hasn't even started for time to see what's going on in spring, winter, and fall to enjoy. When you try to ask to rearrange things because of an event you may want to take time off for it's an issue.

There were no internal jobs posted for my experience level or office position, so I was let go after the number of days allotted for me to obtain a new job.

It is extremely demotivating and addressing it with management is practically useless. You're basically told you need to get over it. My experience there wasn't a good one.

Upper management comes up with 'fixes' but has no idea what the day to day role is and continue to make the job increasingly more difficult. Before I started someone that did not work for this bank said they heard it was a sweat shop and honestly that is a good description. OT is mandatory and the only way to possibly meet management demands. Good for the paycheck, but for quality of life. this bank also recently made the change that employees can roll over 3 vacation days. After two years, employees previously could buy an additional week of vacation but with the 3 day rollover, employees now only have the option to buy 2 days, reducing the number of days employees can take off each year.","Loan Processing Analyst","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 7, 2021","2.0"

Wait for customers to come in to provide service or lobby engage by standing in the lobby and directing customers to either a teller, banker, or manager.

This creates a less than desirable work culture in which you have to watch your back at every turn. I had some of my work 'stolen' by a coworker and my manager assigned my leads to her, she was my senior. Lunch is 30 minutes and you may have a 10 minute break if it's not too busy.

"A life of busy work","A typical day at work: Log in. Join MS Teams. Engage in work/life related banter all day. Each person handles their assigned tasks. Skype Meetings. Log out. Repeat the next day.What you learned: * I learned that Midwest culture in the work place is very NOT diverse. * When working remotely, the best way to feel like you are a part of the this bank family, is to go into a local branch and build relations with them. At least then you won't feel so apart.Management: Like anywhere, some are good, some are bad. Probably the worse part is the deluge of paperwork and processes that change weekly. Its like work for the sake of work. Whenever someone comes up with a procedure, they just make a new rule and even if that impacts some other process, so what.","Vice President","Current Employee","Washington, DC","June 26, 2021","4.0"
"Overworked and Underpaid","I strongly recommend not working on the retail end. The sales goals are unreal and unrealistic and the pay out is terrible. You have to do so much selling and only to get a few hundred dollars of pay out, which is only quarterly. Most of the branches close at 6, so that means you work 8:30am-6pm most days. They also don't pay you anything, no matter the experience you have. At most you will make $42K if you go into a branch as a banker and you have to fight tooth and nail for that. Turnover is extremely high. It's also hard to get days off, and don't even think about asking for a Friday or Monday off. It will be very hard to get, and they will give you the biggest guilt trip if you want either day off. Overall, unless you just really need a job, do not work at this bank on the retail side.

"They try to come off as 'different' but they are just like ever other bank","Working for this bank is inconsistent , they treat some branches much better then others . For example the branches in more impoverished areas have far less technology and the branches aren't as kept up as the more wealthy areas. Working for this bank is like working for any other bank. It has its ups and downs . Your overall enjoyment while with the company varies depending on the manager. One of the major drawbacks for working for this company is how they draw you in because of there status as one of the largest banks in the country but at the end of the day they pay like a small town credit union. Most employees with children have to work part time jobs to make ends meet because this bank refuse to accommodate financially according to the times . Just like any other major financial institution you can go from being the top of the company in sales one month to literally getting fired the next. They are very strict on how they want things done , even if you have a different way that works for you they want it done 'there way'. Overall this company is a bunch of malarkey and filled with false promises . They are just like every other bank . Actually who am i kidding they are worse then other banks . Others banks close between 4:30-5pm this bank decided to close at 6 pm but yet and still they post on the digital screens in branches about promoting a work to life balance .

Management most recently was very unsupportive and exclusionary, especially with respect to individual employee special needs and medical conditions. Oftentimes, I found management to be disregarding, with a negative attitude regarding my experience and my advanced educational level (M.Ed.. + Ph.D. program ABD).at times, it seemed that jealously and a desire to be secretive regarding management's motives and actions was definitely part of the work culture. Openness of management is talked about, but not truly part of the work experience especially in recent years. The most enjoyable part of the job was the (limited) ability to interact with other employees that became my friends and supports. The hardest part of the job was the negativity, unattainable productivity emphasis, lack of openness and truthfulness,and lack of support from the management team, particularly in the area where I worked prior to leaving my position.","Quality Assurance Coordinator","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","June 16, 2021","1.0"

"Smoke & Mirrors ","My experience may be a bit different because I started during a pandemic and was treated fairly but the circumstances set me up for failure in the long run. I didn't have the best management but my team was amazing. Once the branch fell below their little red line, you really started to see you were a number, a worker bee (nicely putting it). Management would become intentionally intimidating and even threatening, implying our jobs were at stake. The morale of my particular branch became so intense and toxic that myself and two others (out of 4 bankers) left. The hours at my location were 8-6 and Saturday's 9-2 and it made my work life balance almost unbearable. My time there was definitely rewarding as far as what I learned and will be able to build from but extremely difficult and hard to please upper management. They will run you ragged and expect the impossible all while putting on a smile wondering why you feel the way you do. This is a great position for someone starting out but I would do my time and go. this bank sells you sunshine and rainbows only to give you extreme stress and expectations that are almost impossible for even the most experienced banker to achieve. Pay was decent, hours are not good if you are looking for work life and family balance. My team of coworkers were the best but management definitely needs a ton of work.

"Poor management ","Poor management, years of service does not mean anything, you are just a number. Branch was not adequately staffed.

Other departments might be better, but I'm only referring to the AML Dept.. Goals are very difficult to achieve as the bar is set so high. Very little to no praise for doing good work.

High deductible healthcare plan, aggressive sales tactics. If you are not making enough in sales, they push you to do more. If you make their requested numbers in sales, they push you to do double.

Coming from a top performer in the Consumer Loans department for 4 years I can tell you, the ceiling is definitely not glass. Where they hire you is where they want to keep you.

"Decent","I was with the company for a long time. From the beginning to the end was a dramatic change. When I started there was a great work life balance and you only worked 5 days a week with regular Saturdays off. At the end you worked every day, but Sunday and getting a Saturday off it was very difficult. You also had to schedule all vacation and PTO in January. So if you needed a last minute doctor appointment, or family conflict later in the year, you had to request to move your days around. Which, might not be approved if someone else requested it off. There was very little room for advancement, even with a decent turn over. Upper management expects tip-top sales. You need to be at the utmost top of the list and you need to harass customers constantly for more sales. You're expected to make a product recommendation to every customer every time. This wouldn't be so bad, except the same customers come in all the time. Eventually, they get really frustrated and annoyed and stop coming in. Then, you're expected to make sales calls and stay late to call customers and ask them to come in for appointments, even to the point of harassment. A system generated list appears and you must contact everyone on the list, even you just called them two weeks ago. ","Teller","Former Employee","Cambridge, OH","March 20, 2021","3.0"
"Decent Job","Its working a bank. lots of customer service, so if thats your thing, then this is the job for you. the other thing you may not be told or realize is this bank requires you to be a salesperson. They will play it off like they are helping customers, but they just reward people who churn out numbers. credit cards, loans. The idea is to get as many as possible. if you don't meet your goals because your clientele is declined repeatedly or can't afford loans and credit card debt, it isn't taken into consideration. Just the results are. It is a good company to work for. fantastic benefits. just very sales oriented and that isn't stressed during the hiring process.

"Not a lot of advancement","Although there are plenty of opportunities within the company it is harder for some positions to move up without starting all over with that positions base pay.

"inclusive work environment with supportive management"," this bank is all about work, life, balance. They value your work ethic and challenge you to do better everyday so you can advance and achieve your goals. They offer competitive pay rates and a great benefits package including 401k matching and generous PTO with paid holidays. With that being said, they do expect you to earn those benefits. There are sales goals to meet and that can be challenging with the other tasks you are expected to complete throughout the day (Such as answering the phone, balancing a drawer, holding appointments, & various office tasks). Ensuring the customer's financial wellbeing is sound is their main focus and some customers do not wish to listen when you offer the advice or product.

The CEO is great and they try to maintain an inclusive culture. Management in my department was great but I can't speak for other departments.

At the same time, coworkers were helpful and knowledgeable. Training team was nice and manager did all she could to help me progress. If you don't want to stay in retail or customer service, stay away. Time off worked on a seniority basis, didn't matter if you put it in months ahead.

"Productive, Fun depends on your TL, Busy ","I do not feel the same about this bank. As I use to. 1. The biggest reason is *No Merit Increase* you want to work a person in three different departments, and No increase. You can do that to others, that may say *Well okay I will accept that* but others will not accept it. I have been through a couple of Acquisitions, with former companies, and my pay actually went up! Not stay the same! No, at this bank. This year there is no pay increase* seems it fell right in line with the Acquisition that just happened. 2. I was on a Team that had no morale. Some had no drive to want to have fun, the TL did not push fun, was dry, and really did not do much. Was behind the scenes hiding, only gave recognition to whom she knew the longest. Some Agents had terrible attitudes, but this could have came from the energy from the TL. 3. The OLD systems we work off of are horrible, too many steps to do anything, this bank took too long to get innovative with their systems *and you have ridiculous Merits to meet* QA is not consistent, some TL's you have to pull teeth to get them to dispute a SET score, some TL's do not acknowledge each Agent for good work. 4. I did not want to go by the career reviews for this bank. But they sure were true. It also seems like greed toke over, and after the acquisition *it was we have to think about this bank pockets.* 5.

"High Stress, Low Pay","There is not a good work-life balance at this bank. I am constantly working through lunch breaks and past my scheduled shift. The workload and responsibilities of this role are not compensated on a fair basis. You will be expected to take on an excessive amount of work with little to no training. I have constantly been lied to regarding raises, workload, and career progression throughout my time with this bank. Managers are scheduled in meetings all day and are not supportive. Upper management has no idea what is actually going on for front-line employees, yet they are the ones that dictate the processes and systems we use. There is also a large disconnect among different internal departments with no departments wanting to claim ownership for work and other issues. This ultimately will fall back on my role to take care because we have the most contact with the customers. This requires us to work on issues and research solutions that we don't have the tools for, all on top of our normal workload. You will find yourself working well outside of the job description with little to no extra incentives with this bank. Fully expect to be lied to regarding pay progression, career progression, and workload when working for this bank.

"Good company to work for. Depending on what position you are in."," this bank as a company is good to work for. Be careful which position you chose.

"Very Hostile Job Environment","This is not a good place to work. this bank Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to them. If a manager feels threatened, they will do everything they can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group. They claim they provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen. The amount the company raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year. So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases. There are plenty more Financial Service Companies out there, I suggest you look somewhere else.","AML Risk specialist III","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 19, 2021","1.0"

"Back to back phone calls and crunched on time","While the pay and benefits are decent and there is paid time off, the job itself is quite stressful with panicked and stressed out customers calling in, often with complex banking issues. Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and they treat you like a customer. When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time. You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete it with the customer on the line. You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do. Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet their own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another. There are many positive aspects to this job including benefits and the way you can call in sick or schedule vacation is very independent, you don't need to tell your boss any personal details, just that you won't be in.You just call the call off line. The sent beautiful flowers to my brothers funeral when I had to call in to attend the funeral, which was incredibly caring. There are a lot of resources for a wide range of things, as long as you know where to look.

"Headed in right direction. But expect Ohio salary, regardless of where you live","I would recommend this bank because from management down to the line, you can tell the company cares about people.However, they are a bank. Nickel-and-dime is what they do best. And salaries are no exception. Although I was able to negotiate a salary commensurate with where I live, I was never able to get a salary raise as the base salary for a big metro area like NYC or DC is far higher than the top earners in the Cleveland, Ohio/Pittsburgh PA market, where most of staff are based.The politics and diversity (lack there of) mimics the state of the nation. Expect nothing different there. The one thing I can say is that women are empowered at this bank and they are very much in leadership positions every where you look.Some areas adopt change and are forward thinking and adapt modern practices. Other areas or groups are stuck in mimicking older banks. There are enough of those pockets of teams that really slow down progress.","Vice President","Current Employee","Remote","February 14, 2021","4.0"

"Do Not Work Here ","Only lasted 2 months at this location before I was let go this was by far the most sales heavy job I've ever worked. They expect you to make a sale with every customer that comes in and you are cold calling customers during your down time that want nothing to do with you. Training was awful as instructors never actually showed you how to do anything. We were also consistently under-staffed during my time there so we always worked six days a week. You are consistently micromanaged by your manager and after every customer you are criticized for not making a sale and instead of coaching and training the manager would just tell me what I did wrong and would consistently talk bad behind employees backs.

Amazing Diversity & Inclusion program as well with local and national EBRG chapters in addition to regional councils to ensure our activities within our communities are perfectly in line with our values as an organization. The leadership truly believes in improving financial literacy and demonstrates it through many philanthropic efforts across the US. During the pandemic, while every bank was reducing cost, this bank invested by creating an entire division within the commercial bank dedicated to organizational financial wellness. Base pay I would say is very fair and bonuses have both a set and discretionary component. Very good health plan benefits with HSA, 401k and Pension.

"Fake work life balance","This place promotes work life balance but doesn't actually allow employees to have a life outside of work. Management expects employees to work almost every weekend and most nights. Also, it is impossible to get any actual work done because meetings are scheduled throughout the entire day. So if you want to get any real work done, you have to work after hours. Management does not trust their employees' knowledge and the management consistently does the opposite of what is recommended.

"Compensation and Culture are low.","Visit onsites and promote this banks products. Open accounts onsite outside of branches. You must have a good team leader if you want to enjoy this role. Management attributed to a very toxic 'team' environment. Often inciting competition, gossip and slander as a form of 'motivation' and influence. I went on medical leave and when I came back, my position was switched by my direct manager to a floater position where I had to drive 2 hours to get to any onsites. Spoke to HR and nothing could be done. The decision did not make success in my role conducive since most of my time was spent driving. My advice when working here: Don't get sick, don't seek surgery to get well or you may not have your position to come back to. Also, this is a dead end role even if you are a rock star with your goals. Many of my team members have been in this role for years (as much as 13 years) and have not gotten promoted or considered. Outsiders were hired and promotion from within non-existent. The pay was certainly not worth the headaches.","FINANCIAL SALES CONSULTANT","Former Employee","Duluth, GA","January 30, 2021","2.0"
"Productive, lots of room for advancement, stressful frontline roles","Just like most call centers, the frontline position can be pretty stressful with back to back calls which was the hardest part of my job along with the metric goals that were expected to be met every month while maintaining high scoring quality evaluations. Personally, the quality of my customer interactions took priority over my own metrics, which became a topic of conversation during personal coaching meetings. However, my experience with this bank as a company, was very positive. The environment was always supportive, inclusive, and motivating. There were many resources available to all employees within the call center such as resume workshops, public speaking and leadership groups, and career corner opportunities (where you can learn more about other careers within the call center). this bank also had a comprehensive benefits package (including health/life/vision/dental insurance, 14 days of PTO given each calendar year, occasional VTO offered, up to 6 paid sick days, HSA, ISP 401k, FMLA, pension plan, home buying assistance, employee specific APRs on credit cards/loans, separate rooms within call center for nursing mothers, etc.).

It is VERY sales-driven, and there is not necessarily room to grow a career. They don't pay enough for all the work they require from you, customers can be very moody/rude. High turnover rate, and extremely under-staffed branches. Most of the time you have so much work, that you will leave something 'hanging', and most likely will be called out for it.

"Good company going downhill"," this bank was great at first, customer service was the most important goal. Then, almost overnight, sales became the dominating concern. Initially I worked in a branch environment. The sales pressure over time became intolerable, so I decided to apply for and obtain a position in a less stressful environment.In my role as client Solution Specialist, it was a great, very professional atmosphere. Many good people. Unfortunately this is a position you cannot learn with a handful of books, training that consisted of 5 days sitting and watching another rep, and a 'buddy' via Skype, who was mostly tied up with their own jobs to take time to assist. Asking for assistance was frowned upon, and nothing shy of perfection was treated as a disaster, where good performance was rarely addressed. this bank started as a great job, but the sales pressure in the retail side, and the borderline hostile atmosphere of the , it became a nightmare that worsened daily. 2015 this bank was a great company. Throughout 2016 it was mostly downhill. 2017 became absolutely intolerable from a stress standpoint to the degree I resigned before I even had alternative employment lined up.

"Branch Banker Associate","Do not listen to what they promise you. You will work 9-10 hour days in a glorified retail position. The company allows for customers to walk all over you, so long as they are happy. The only thing that they are concerned about is making a sale and trying to bring up numbers. They care very little for work-life balance and instead want you to be committed to a culture of selling and putting customers before your family. If it was not for my manager, I would have quit long ago. You will meet plenty of great co-workers, but it does not make up for the poor excuse of the rest of the job. The technology is 30 years behind and the systems you work with often crash or are not user friendly. In the position I worked, I had to do personal banking and teller work. You would think that would justify some kind of pay raise, but you will make marginally more than a teller and less than a banker. Essentially you are paid to do two jobs while receiving the pay of one job. The hours are long, and often I have worked 3-4 Saturdays a month. In terms of career advancement, it really depends on how they are feeling. They will tell you that after the first year of working here that you are able to move anywhere in the company. This is false doctrine, as they have denied me to 14 different jobs that I have applied for since my one year. Unless you produce an unholy amount of sales, they have no interest in moving you from retail. In conclusion, if you like sales and customer service you will enjoy this position.

The company has great benefits with their 401k, health, dental, vision and employee stock purchasing. Working in retail banking gets very tiring.. After awhile you get tired of the clientele that comes in with overdrawn accounts every other day that can't manage their accounts. If you're good at multiple tasks don't be surprised to be taken advantaged of. I was the ATM custodian for years because another coworker was too slow. And I was expected to manage the teller line and also do banking on the platform side. Worked very hard day to day and deserved to be in a better position or at least be getting raises as I had always had a meets all yearly review.Also, the incentives you receive quarterly were lacking and felt like a joke.

"Good pay and benefits "," this bank is a solid company with good benefits. Branches have set hours, and tellers don't need to stay indefinitely after work because the vault needs to be closed. Retail banking isn't for everyone. Some customers are just angry and irrational, particularly when they have caused their own problem. Unfortunately, they sometimes get the opportunity to answer a survey about you personally after they visit the branch. this bank. takes these surveys as gospel, and you can end up doing your job well, correctly, and kindly but being dinged in the survey by unreasonable customers. You have no defense. Something else that's hard is that this bank is very oriented to large cities, and their sales techniques and expectations don't play well in small towns where you have the same customers over and over. They don't want a credit card, as they told you last week and the week before, and some don't like that tellers are looking at their accounts closely, even to see what services or upgrades might really be helpful.

"Horrible Management & Unfair Treatment","Management is absolutely horrendous. The managers are two-faced.I felt like I am not treated equally based on position. The managers have favorites, there is always some sort of drama that they sit in office all day and gossip.The benefits are nice. The managers seem to think treating their employees like animals and brainwashing us into thinking this is normal treatment is OK.The managers fired the two employees that were open about their sexuality and I find that interesting - this bank boasts about their diversity, yet they fired them...our staff consists of only two POC (the rest is entirely white). The new employee that they hired got terminated within a week (she was also a POC, for reference).I learned to stick up for myself, not be taken advantage of (even though it almost got me fired multiple times).I went to the managers to file a complaint against another employee for inappropriate misconduct, yet they turned it into a lesson on how I was wrong for coming to them and it wasn't important enough to be filed on my behalf. I felt like I wasn't heard and I was bashed for bringing the situation to light.The branch manager breaks the dress code consistently. I wore a pair of heels (once) & they did not have a strap on the back. I got called into the office and was demanded to change my shoes. Wearing short dresses, sleeveless shirts/dresses, etc, the dress code doesn't apply to her. Abuse of power & position.The branch manager boldly told the staff, to our faces, with no hesitation, about her breast augmentation, because that is ethical and that is definitely - more...","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Cranberry Township, PA","September 5, 2020","1.0"

"Former Pgh Employee","● Work-life balanceMy branch had absolutely no work life balance. It was basically like you back to high school in terms of the employees being extremely over-dramatic, refusing to do their jobs, and there was never follow up from management unless it was to punish. Even then, it felt like they didn't want to handle out of control employees. Because of that, I was constantly on call, coming in on my days off and staying late but getting in trouble for the amount of overtime I inevitably accrued.● Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with this bank are grossly under compensated for their role. We were expected to act as managers with barely an increase in salary from a basic full- or part-time teller.● Job security and advancement this bank always has opportunities for advancement but they will absolutely play favorites on who they allow to progress.● ManagementManagement, from branch to upper management, only care about meeting their sales goals. You are not a valued employee, you are a small part of a large machine. It does not matter if you are sick, overworked, in need of help from your management team, they are not there for you.● CultureIt was like walking back into high school, complete with cliques and double standards. If you want a professional career, avoid banking at the branch level with this bank unless you have the patience of a saint.● OverallOverall, I do not recommend this bank as a place to establish a professional career in banking or otherwise unless you are okay with playing the role of either yes man or scapegoat.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 3, 2020","1.0"

"Stretches Employees Thin","I was a 'part time' teller who was regularly scheduled 45+ hours a week. But they preach no overtime under any circumstance so I would often be there 6 days a week for 9+ hours a day, with 1-2 hour unpaid lunches where I just sort of sat around and waited to clock back in, all so I could stay under 39.75 hours, or god forbid they'd have to pay me benefits. I was told this was temporary as they were short staffed but this went on for the entire time I worked there. Within a few months of being there I was one of the senior-most tellers because the turnover rate was so high and everyone around me left. Management expects so much of you and it's impossible to meet all quotas and expectations. The customers are allowed to walk all over you and you just have to eat it with a smile. Management expects you to do the job of 3-4 people yet doesn't even pay well enough to cover the job you were hired to do. Worst job I've ever had.

"Job Has Pro's & Con's","Overall I feel as if it was a good job to gain more customer experience. The pro's to the job is the pay rate (pays really good for a entry level). The job is pretty stressful as well; you have to know how to deal with the constant yelling from customers and the constant changes within the company that you aren't notified of on time enough to explain to customers. You can't advance the way you would like to; you have to work a whole year to get your hours changed and their isn't any pay increase unless you change positions. Management is so so; sometimes they help but most of the time they aren't much help at all. Plus breaks are based off how busy the center is that day; sometimes you were on the phones for 3-4hours before your short break of 15mins. I liked the pay but otherwise it was just to many other problems that continued to happen. It was hard to follow the policy 100% correctly because it was so many constant changes going on plus you didn't have enough chances to correct anything before they'll write you up. I wouldn't recommend this job due to the amount of stress your put through and you don't get enough help from management.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","August 10, 2020","2.0"

In addition if you are coming into the company, ask for a lot because they may pay you more than somebody who is getting a promotion.

"Decent work/life balance but overall you are just a number","I worked for this bank for over eleven years and yet I can sum up my thoughts on the company with one example and just a few sentences. In the department where I worked, the employees were grouped into teams which usually consisted of a dozen or so people, a team lead, and a manager. Our group of eight consultants and a team lead received a new manager after our manager retired. At the time, all nine of us had each been with the company for no less than ten years (and some over twenty). Within less than two years of this new manager taking over every single consultant and the team lead left by either transferring to another department, quitting, or retiring early. No one in upper management even noticed. The work itself isn't difficult but it does require a certain amount of knowledge and the training is insufficient. Communication between departments is chaotic and confusing and while the pay isn't terrible, raises are non-existent. As far as advancement, it depends on what department in the bank that you start from. If you begin in certain areas, no matter what degree or what experience you have you will be judged as being 'less than' and forced to advance in baby steps, often making lateral moves. That being said, there are opportunities to work from home and overall the job is kind to working mothers and fathers/young families.","Loan Support Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 8, 2020","2.0"

But the manger will not have your back at all even if she says something her way and finds it wrong at a later date or even a few minutes after and will through all the blame on you. Claiming people come in late to work but she does not even open the bank on time and even with proof that you are there earlier than her she will still tell you to be earlier. The best way to explain is; you expect me to come into work on my computer ready to go with everything at 8:30 am, however, how am I to achieve that if you are rolling into the parking lot at 8:28 am. It is physically impossible. Overall very toxic. Also, the turn over rate in my five months working there was 8 people! Like how is that not a problem!

" this bank is always trying to feed you","A Typical day at this bank includes being on the phones all day with your two standard 15 min brakes and one 30 min lunch which fly by. Time moves so slowly when your on the floor, your on the phone taking about 150 phone calls per day. I learned a tons there your in training every other month its a lot to take in at times but you get through it. the management is horrible there's never anyone around when you really need help and they have no issue throwing you under the bus to save their behind after they told you to do something. (always record your conversations while with management so you don't lose your job seen countless people fired for things they were told to do by management) The workplace culture itself is pretty good when your dealing with other employees someone is always trying to feed you. the hardest part of the job would be taking the back to back calls and getting yelled at by customer's and trying to keep good quality scores which is hard to do because your graded on the call you took even if its a ball call, if you don't have thick skin this is not the job for you. You will be screamed at cursed at ect. the most enjoyable part of the job is all the pot lucks like i said they love to feed you.","Fraud caseworker","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","March 11, 2020","3.0"

"100% Micromanaged","I've been at this bank for about 3 months and not a day goes by without me thinking if I want to come to work or call out. The system that this bank has is extremely outdated; to get a statement, you would have to go to 3 systems to get there. Not only is the system outdated but so is the building and furniture. Everything that you do here is micromanaged. With every customer, you have to write down their name and account number for a daily debrief where management would go over that and see where you had missed opportunities to make sales. You always have to click the insights whenever a customer is in front of you, if not, they get mad. They want to know why you wouldn't sell a 96 year old man a credit card. There's also cold calls you have to do. Upper management expect you to make 100 dials a week and have at least 2 appointments daily. If it's a holiday or you were sick, you have to make up those dials when you come back. They worry more about the dials than customer service. The training is horrible. They throw you into a pack of wolves with no protection. You learn while being on the job. Branch support will be your best friend because no one will help you. They also expect you to know everything about banking so you're able to deliver the insights. They would tell you to bring someone more seasoned into the conversations, but when you do, no one will reach out and you're made a fool out of yourself. Sales goals is ridiculous. You would have think after the Wells Fargo controversy, this bank would cut down on the aggression of sales.

I'm now actively looking for another job, should have done it years ago but I kept expecting them to figure it out and do the right thing. They literally give you a pay decrease after factoring in inflation year on year even with exceeds expectations or better and sometimes none at all. Their managers are told to average out 1 to 2 percent increases for everyone and will move you and your managers evaluation of you lower to fit that (not just in pay but performance). They do nothing for the good of the employee beyond what they are guilted into via industry pressures or PR. The decisions they make are short sighted. HR and incompetency has convinced them they don't need to actually pay employees. 1+ BILLION in pure profit a quarter (that's 4 times a year) for over a decade in a row and they don't pay their employees at all. It's astounding and incredible to me this is allowed to occur. It's unethical, immoral, and corrupt. I don't say these things lightly. It hurts. I've worked there for a long time.

"Decent company if you get into the right department","Plenty of office politics, great opportunities, but there are potential land mines to navigate that can derail a career. Fall into the wrong project and you can be sidelined. They are the big fish in the market, so that makes it hard to negotiate salary once you're hired. So negotiate upfront and be prepared to live with that decision. Good benefits, decent enough work/life balance for some, lots of overtime for others. For this I'd give it a mixed review.

"Employees are just another number","Most managers in the region that I worked were not qualified to give the tools to help advance employees. They were either not motivated or simply not skilled.

I tried but no growth.","Banker","Former Employee","Chicago land area","January 30, 2020","1.0"
"Poor Management","Management does not appear to respect employees from the beginning: many interviews, sometimes no communication afterward, no return phone calls after demanding time prior to hiring; the largest concern is sales and what the employee can do for the company rather than ensuring the company also fits into some of the employee's needs for better morale. It's hypocritical to ask that customer facing employees perform perfectly while hiring managers and branch managers have little to no people or communication skills, lack of etiquette, and lack of basic courtesy. Not everyone that applies to this bank carries a nothing more than a high school diploma and there are people in the workforce who would like to be treated with some form of dignity. If you live in Southern Maryland and you would like to be treated fairly and with respect, look and apply elsewhere.

As an in store sales associate, you were required to walk around grocery store and try to get people to open up accounts/ credit cards. Management was fairly new and didn't offer support. Their main response was 'what can I do to help you get more customers?' Bank was very short staffed and you are often found alone with little to no support should issues arise when you are new.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Middletown, NJ","January 29, 2020","1.0"

I have been working until 10 pm every night, it has stressed my family out to where they cant take it anymore that they never see me but for a couples hours here and there EVEN when I work from home.

"Good place to start a career for the most part","Overall this is a great job to grow with. I would recommend going in as a plat form member though. Being a teller means you have the most transaction in the bank. Meaning they constantly set high goals for you to reach.which wouldn't be bad, but they keep making it harder to hit the incentive goal. meaning you don't get the incentive pay. Since i started they have taken 3 things away that would've been a referral for us. meaning now its even hard to hit the goal. also when you are hired on, they say it isn't a sales job, but it really is. They want us to push credit card offers, and that's fine and all, but asking the same person more than once is rude. especially when its not in the customers best interest all the time. We also don't get a lot of new customers in the branch. most of them are older, or have some debt. Generally those customers do not want a new credit card. But we are told to ask and make sure they leave with a hand out. even if you hit your referral goals, its never good enough..","Teller","Current Employee","Springfield, OH","January 28, 2020","4.0"
"Good benefits, mediocre compensation, difficult to advance to upper management"," this bank in my opinion is a good starting ground. Advancing in lower positions is very achievable, but advancing to upper management is impossible... The pay is okay, not the highest, but still better than most. Incentive plan is mediocre, unless in a very high traffic/ high net worth area. Benefits like healthcare and vacation are very good. Work culture is inviting, but certain policies in place allow for employees to slack and really not get punished (my own branch experiences).","Branch Sales and Service Associate I","Current Employee","Vero Beach, FL","January 27, 2020","3.0"

"I would not recommend this bank","Its becoming a product pushing company. Employees are under paid, unhappy which has a high turnover rate. Customer are affected by it and they will express their concerns through customer surveys which employees get an incentive on the overall branch performance, not individually. The goal is to reach out to others branches for help but they are barley staffed themselves. Upper management doesn't care about employees career path all they want to make sure you are getting Credit Card applications on a daily basis and investment referrals.It is all about what this bank can get. this bank make it seem better than what it is.

Expectations are unrealistic, cuts are made with low level employees, no such thing as company loyalty or job security, they talk about employee engagement but sow seeds of fear and uncertainty...I could go on.","BM","Former Employee","Ohio","January 7, 2020","2.0"
"Give time to learn to employees","Manager was unprofessional, coworker was unprofessional, in the mid time they go home and do your laundering and after come back in branch , costumer service was bad out side ATM they was not consider service with customer and coworkers and manager are raciest and they behaved with new people with very bad my experience was very bad with this bank I think they have to focus in internal management.","RRT MLO","Former Employee","842 st road Princeton","January 7, 2020","1.0"
"Modern Cutting Edge Office with Great People","The people at this bank are a reason to stay. I felt my team truly cared about me as a person and wanted to see me succeed. The office space was comfortable and made it easy to get work done. HR has policies in place they made it difficult to advance financially or by title, but aside from that I think it is a great company to work for.","Scrum Master","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 6, 2020","4.0"
"A day at work","Finding solutions for clients financial needs and helping balancing their everyday money management limits on a daily basis. Opening accounts, loan applications, mortgage referrals.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","January 6, 2020","5.0"
"Has is positives and negatives","I have mixed reviews. I like working for the company and although they promote working to get you a better position, some management doesn't seem to try or care. Also, you don't get paid for the work you do beyond the basics. And sometimes not even that. There is no raises and during the 'year end reviews', they are minimal, if at all.","Outreach Sales Representative","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 6, 2020","3.0"
"just a job","I did customer service same as any other call center in Columbus Ohio. it is kind of like a high school environment, a lot of gossip and child play. but as long as you go to work and do your job you should be fine","Online Banking Technical Support","Former Employee","Columbus, OH","January 6, 2020","3.0"
