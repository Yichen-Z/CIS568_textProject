"Never Work Here.","Currently work here as an application developer. They simply do not respect your time of home life. They will work you all kinds of crazy hours. I have worked many 20 hour days. Management does not follow this bank's rules and guidelines. They're pretty much given free reign and aren't govern or checked, so basically, you're at the mercy of your manager whether you perform well or not. Minorities have a harder time getting management positions. They are overworking their skilled employees and underworking the people right out of college with no skills.

"Great Place to Work","A typical day at this bank would start off with a short meeting about goals and what the focus is for the day. You will get the opportunity to learn as much as you can. Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking. My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to that plan. That's the best way to succeed. The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet. The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with the territory. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for it among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner.

The turn over rate for this bank is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact). So if you don't mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you're willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than this bank is the place for you.

Although we got quarterly bonuses, my hourly pay was significantly less than other tellers from other companies. this bank just recently changed their pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service.

The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny. The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for. The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are. All in all, this bank is a great company to work for.

The scenarios given and the training provided does not, realistically, give you any sense of what you will be doing on a day to day basis. Once training ends, you are essentially on your own and any questions you ask can be answered any number of different ways depending on who you ask.

"The hardest part of the job","The hardest part of this role is the on-the-job training experience for handling the sales and service sides of a branch store. You attend 3-5 day training workshops periodically to learn all about sales. However, there is not much preparation for handling scenarios in which you would need to provide services to customers.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Plainsboro, NJ","October 17, 2017","3.0"

" this bank is the most underhanded company to work for","Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for it. this bank does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset that over time. this bank lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits them. Management is an absolute joke. If you ever try to leave the company, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, those managers will try everything in their power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if they can help it. I know from personal experience. Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet those goals, this bank won't fire you for not meeting the goals, but they WILL fire you for not doing your 'job'. The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if this bank is not careful, they will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has. I would never recommend this company to ANYONE.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Tuscaloosa, AL","October 17, 2017","1.0"

"Great place to work","I really like my job I came with no banking experience but the training is very helpful I was able to earn a promotion in less than 6 months off being hired.

"Rocky start, terribble management","The training process was lengthy and frustrating. You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved them in a timely manner. Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees. There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts. She would come and go for hours as she pleased. We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff. There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue. I personally felt demeaned and pushed aside by the branch manager.","Teller","Former Employee","Akron, OH","October 13, 2017","2.0"
"Good full time job while in college","While in college, this was an ideal job. The flexible scheduling mixed with the busy workplace was productive. However, despite popular belief, this job is predominantly sales. Goals are set high and are difficult to meet unless you really know how to talk.

"Lack of communication, poor management and no sense of direction.","This place is a sink or swim type of job. There is NO training that actually teaches anyone how to do their job. Because everything is so numbers driven, co-workers can't/won't make time to help new people out, and those who do are punished with poor performance ratings. Suggestions for improvement are ignored. Upper management is too busy having meetings about the meetings they have to actually take time to talk to their 'minions' to find out what is happening in the office and how they can help make the workplace a better environment. Quarterly financials talk about how much the bank is making, but at year end review they can't afford to give their employees raises. Employees feel like they are just numbers and not truly appreciated.

"Could be better","The company preaches customer service first which is great; Employees were taught to take a care of the customers, and most did, but I feel that the company could have done a better job of taking care of the employees. The pay is very low compared to most retail banking companies so sales associates try to make up for the compensation through commission. However, the company is doing more and more to push customers to bank on their own as opposed to in the branch, which in turn makes it more difficult for employees to hit the sales numbers in order to earn a decent commission. this bank is constantly looking for employees--that's good for some, bad for others.","Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","New Jersey","September 28, 2017","2.0"

The only thing is if you like tracking and getting micro managed by upper management then you should go for it. Other than that, helping out the customers can be very rewarding not only for yourself but also for your paycheck.

"sweat shop, no care for the employee","The company lacked training and had very few managers that knew the products well enough to assist. They pushed a very heavy work load on their employees. The goals were very out of reach that very few people reached them. They kept increasing the hours. They would have us go in on Saturday too to work more and during the winter they shut of the heat. It got to the point where they were having their employees push in a code every time they left their desk such as making a copy, faxing, taking a loan to a manager, taking a file to u/w etc. It was crazy. They also wanted us to call our customer every day if we had an update or not. It got to the point our underwriters were to work 10 hours then take their computers home to work and also work the weekends. They eventually got up in droves and left 20 at a time. We had no one to underwriter our files and we were still held accountable for closing the loan.

"Great company if you work in the right area","Worked for this bank in 2 different markets. The experience was night and day. In one area, there was an excellent support and development network and plenty of opportunity to move into different areas of the bank depending on individual skills and preferences. There was at minimum weekly interaction with specialty team members that handled investments, mortgages, wealth management, etc. to assist in serving the client's needs and identifying clients who would benefit from a targeted conversation with a specialist. It was possible to develop mutually beneficial relationships with the team members assigned to your branch and effectively meet client needs and generate revenue for the bank. In the other area, there was little to no support from senior leadership, inexperienced management in the branches, lack of clear communication, and no plans for expansion in a market where branches are over 2 hours from the nearest branch. The lack of branches means that each day becomes an exercise in handling complaints or cashing checks for non-customers with very little opportunity to focus on growing business. Interaction with specialty team members was non-existent. Conversations about investments, mortgages, estate planning, and more are routed through call centers and handled by indifferent team members who never meet the clients and rarely close on business. Clients would often become frustrated because there was no local investment adviser or mortgage representative to meet with and would walk out and take their business elsewhere.

"Not a good place for loan officers","Worked in the Home Lending Center and it ended up being a nightmare. Volume was down significantly, resulting in the majority of LOs not hitting tier targets, thus leading to not making any money. There is likely going to be any change to the compensation plan to accurately reflect how much each loan officer is funding. It is hard to make a decent living off a low salary and very low commission. The leads are now stale, with internal customers being called up several times every other month. Processors on the backend are very inexperienced for the most part, and a lot of underwriters will poorly review files and not know product guidelines for the loan they are underwriting. The loan officers are dependent on them to make any, and it's frustrating when they perform poorly as your pay is somewhat dependent on them. Turn over is extremely high, with a good majority of new hires not lasting one year. They will train you without experience, and being a large company have excellent benefits.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 6, 2017","1.0"

Those are where you work as a teller and platform but get paid less than a platform in a traditional branch. You also work 11-7 weekdays as well as Sundays which stinks. The benefits are great I must say and training was very informative. But another con is feeling like product pushers when the company says that isn't what they are about.

"Collections at this bank","Being a collections specialist meant you had to be on the phone 90% of the time, making calls and trying to collect customer's debt. I was lucky and had good supervisors, however supervisors don't have a lot of control on what happens because their bosses make those decisions. Hourly pay was okay, but once commissions changed it was a lot harder to make the same amount as before. Customers can get pretty upset over the phone (which can be understandable), however I was taught on what to say and how to approach calls differently.

"Great Opportunities for Advancement"," this bank is a great company to start a career at. The managers will work with you to make sure you are getting into the line of business that you want to work in. They have plenty of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort. Your day varies based on the position you are in. We have branches, call centers, out of branch sales and multiple other lines of business. The culture is very friendly, I have always enjoyed the environment created by my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job is the amount of goals set for someone to accomplish, it can be overwhelming, at the same time extremely motivating. There is always something to work on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created within the workplace and with the customers.","MULTI CHANNEL SALES ASSOCIATE I","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","August 14, 2017","5.0"

"Somewhat stressful, high-pressure environment with benefits that can pay off","Any bank is going to be high-pressure. this bank as a corporation does a nice job of providing compensation, benefits, and perks to make up for this. However, I found that the high emphasis on driving sales really affected the work environment, to the point where it was emphasized over customer service - especially when upper management came to visit the branch. The corporate business model really made it hard to focus on what the job was all about - even down to the teller position.","Teller","Former Employee","NJ","August 11, 2017","4.0"
"Hard to go into everyday","They tell you not to be a product pusher but lay a set number of what they call 'expectations' on you to meet per quarter, which makes you a product pusher if you want to meet them. If you do not meet these 'expectations' it affects your ability to move up within the company and also raises. Policies and rules constantly change and there is rarely anyone, including managers, who have the right info to give you. There is a survey system that is random and anonymous that asks customers questions based on your interaction, if they even remember it was you, it is very unfair that also determines if you receive pay raises and your ability to advance in the company. I've received bad surveys from customers due to their bad interactions with a different employee all because they survey is anonymous on who the employee was, and it is almost impossible to come back from a bad survey. The maternity leave is awesome, 16 weeks of 100% pay, which honestly is the only reason I stayed with the company for my final months.","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Rockford, IL","August 11, 2017","1.0"

I had 2 years of banking (at another institution) when I came to this bank & they wouldn't even match the salary I STARTED with at the other institution. Management is a JOKE. They truly have no say in anything that goes on. The goals are attainable, but always changing, making it difficult to be consistent. The expectations are unrealistic, & again, always changing. There is no reward or recognition for ANYTHING. They do not care about their employees or the customer, all they care about are numbers. If you are going into a company looking to advance, this is NOT the place to do it. They require you to be in your current position for a year, they run your credit for any positions you apply for (even promotions within), your goals have to be well beyond what is expected of you, and you have to actually have a manger that cares about your development (DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH).. I could go on forever.. but if you like the shiny perks they hold in front of your face & you're willing to sell your soul, you'll be just fine! Side note: don't get too comfortable in your position, they will surely displace you. 400+ jobs this year alone.","Teller","Former Employee","Ohio","August 7, 2017","1.0"

Despite excellent reviews each year, the promised raises were never above 1.25%, even though the newspaper listed the CEO's raises as 43% one year and more recently around 14%. The benefits? Sound good on paper, but the deductible is $3,000 per year per insured person. They say the hire the best and the brightest but those people either laugh at the low salaries or leave after a year or two. I worked for other local banks, so I can compare.

No one really cares what you have going on outside of this bank and you can trade shifts with co workers but if your department isn't 24 hours and you can only trade with people on your shift that males trading difficult because more than likely everyone just about works the same shift.

I experienced a lack of leadership, the branch experienced a lack of support from upper management. For a 4-5 month period, including over the holidays which are the busiest times of the year, the branch was left with barely a staff. Many times there was only one teller when there needed to be three. The manager cared more about sales versus customer service, and many times would deceive the customer. The upper management was well aware of the problems in the branch and didn't seem to bother to help. As I kept working there I was starting to hear from other people in the company how it was changing and not for the better.

"Good company...low pay","The environment was great. The people are great. The only con I have with this bank is the compensation is on the low end for finance. There are bonus opportunities, but until you hit the upper levels of management the compensation is lacking. You do work in a 9-5 environment and that is a big plus. The part of this role that was the most irritating was the outbound calling of your customers. Having to dial 15 customers per day to 'invite' (solicit) them to come in for a financial checkup was never fun. I felt like a telemarketer at times.","Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Ashland, KY","June 7, 2017","4.0"

"Not for the faint of heart"," this bank tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all. Even in emergency situations. The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day. For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again. Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Oshtemo, MI","June 5, 2017","3.0"

Management is awesome with all warm and smiling faces. The hardest part of the job would be sitting at a desk alone without anybody around to communicate with while at the same time that is also the best part because it leads to better focus and work flow.

Management (based off of location) is helpful to a point, but often is unavailable for assistance. Every day is different which is exciting but can also cause unneeded stress like most customer service related positions can be. Workplace culture is best described as 'every man for themselves' most days. A few colleagues will band together, but there is a lot of disconnect between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of my day is definitely helping clients reach their financial goals. Nothing makes me more excited to walk in the front door, than knowing I can help someone get out of debt, or buy a new house for their family.

I also have clearance to do supervisor duties and task but I'm only a titled as a teller and receive teller pay. I even applied for the job and was denied it, even though I am currently 'doing' the job now and has been for the past month. there has been other people here for many years and they said it has been years since the even got a raise in pay. and there are many days we don't even get a lunch because of staffing issues. my branch manager is awesome though and the only reason why this bank got this much of my time","Teller","Current Employee","Ohio","May 11, 2017","2.0"

There is so much turnover that people who should not be in management are moved into management positions - it's not just the lack of management experience but the overall lack of leadership People were walked out for reasons that were never explained leaving you to wonder if you were doing something wrong and not aware of it and if you were going to be next My observation was that people were often singled out as if they were looking for a way to get rid of them by giving them extra tasks to complete that were not required of others in that position; basically making their life so miserable that they would look for another job.","Sales","Former Employee","Southeast","May 3, 2017","1.0"

Although I have a lot going on in my life, I still manage to come to work with a positive attitudes. You get back what you give and if you are willing to give your best, others will see you shine and great things will happen for you and those who shine with you. this bank may not be for everyone, but I am doing the most with what I have with this bank and when it's time to transition to something new, I will still be proud to tell anyone that I've worked for this bank.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","April 19, 2017","5.0"

"Great company","It was a great place to work with co-workers and a manager (and actually other managers as well) there to give you support. The training was not as good as it should have been and on-the-job-training was hard to do with everyone with a client and not having someone to help you. That slowed me down a bit. My branch was Universal, meaning you worked all aspects of banking. Teller, platform, and lobby. Great concept, but hard to do in reality. However, those that can be persistent and can close sales, you will make a boatload of money. I loved helping customers. I didn't like trying to sell to customers unless I knew it would help them out. Banks are a business and I hate I couldn't be that person they wanted me to be, but they supported me and gave me all sorts of help in trying to make me a better banker. I have no one to blame but myself. Geat company with good pay and benefits and time off.

"Banking is the same anywhere","Banking was fun when I first started but more and more it became mostly about pushing clients into opening accounts and applying for services that were completely unneeded, simply for the fact that each employee has to reach a certain number of accounts on a monthly basis. The job is more about reaching goals and hitting certain numbers rather than actually getting to know your clients and really following them through into the directions they need to go. Many times if you didn't reach your goals at the end of the month, you would have to pull an all-nighter making phone calls to clients with a nice savings account and beg them to come in and turn some of that cash into a frozen long-term account.

"Do not waste your time working in this bank Customer Service Dept.","Rushed training, management is cutthroat. If your really good on the phones in the first day of training outside of the classroom they keep you, otherwise forget ever moving into the role of Customer Service Representative. The Customer Service Management claim they are experts in whether your going to be bad or good on the phones the first day and if you are slow learning the 15-20 screens you need to know, they cut you immediately. Also you can't get the vacations you asked for because your last in line so new training classes are not going to get requested time off. They also ask you to open a new bank account one week into classroom trading, don't do it. If they cut you, close the account immediately. Also there is no accountability at the whole company as there is no complaint resolution, except for a call center.

"Wish I stayed","I've never had a job where I left and I regretted it not even a month later. I had to leave because I unfortunately wasn't getting paid enough. The staff, managers, and regional managers are absolutely amazing. Always very helpful, very nice and understanding. Not only did this job give me the opportunity to meet amazing people, but it gave me life skills that I will carry on with me for the rest of my life such as leaning how to balance a check book, manage not only my bank account, but large amounts of money as well. It taught me security and how to be careful with bank account information, how to apply for a loan, how to manage a loan, how to apply for a credit card, how to manage credit cards, mortgages, how to apply for one, what's expected when applying for a mortgage, the process, etc. The hardest part of the job is watching out for scam artists. Some people aren't as nice and honest as you think. Customers will come in trying to be someone else with fake IDs, you will run into TONS of counterfeit money, but learn how to catch it, and managing thousands of dollars all at once. You definitely have to learn how to keep track of it at all times. There's a lot of security and procedures you have to learn in case of a robbery as well, but as long as you know what you're doing at that moment, you will be fine.","TELLER","Former Employee","PA","February 15, 2017","5.0"
