3853,"Horrible","Working there was horrible. I never had been so stressed in my life. You are a machine to them and they don't care. You have to work forced overtime which they have the right to take back. If you live close to their I guess that wouldn't be a problem but if you commute back and forth from the city it can be quite time consuming. They are a 24/7 operation yet there is no flexibility. Everyone talks about everyone and the only way to move up is to best friends with a supervisor or manager.

3857,"Banking is the same anywhere","Banking was fun when I first started but more and more it became mostly about pushing clients into opening accounts and applying for services that were completely unneeded, simply for the fact that each employee has to reach a certain number of accounts on a monthly basis. The job is more about reaching goals and hitting certain numbers rather than actually getting to know your clients and really following them through into the directions they need to go. Many times if you didn't reach your goals at the end of the month, you would have to pull an all-nighter making phone calls to clients with a nice savings account and beg them to come in and turn some of that cash into a frozen long-term account. It was dreadful.","Customer Service Associate","Former Employee","Clifton, NJ","April 5, 2017","4.0"
