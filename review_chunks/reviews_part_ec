The doors and phone lines open at 9am. Throughout the day you juggle phone calls and clients in your office. The interactions may be as simple as changing a pin number on a debit card to helping a client recover from being a victim of fraud. Each integration is unique and the work to conclude it can take from 2 minutes to many days. During each interaction my goal is to gain a full financial picture for the client. I want to make sure they understand their banking, have proper protection on their finances, have a true financial goal and plans to achieve it as well as to make sure that they are receiving all the benefits that their bank has to offer.
