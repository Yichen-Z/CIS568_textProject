2283,"Beware!","DON'T DO IT!!! The main reason I took this job was because it was a work from home position. But it's AWFUL! Their turnover rate is ridiculously high & I see why! The training is so poor it's not even funny. You're basically in a room with a 'trainer' who sits on her phone all day. You just do web based learning & tutorials to cover this bank in the case that you completely screw up an account. That way they can say well you as the employee were given the correct tools to avoid this from happening. The pay is TERRIBLE! They give you a 10% differential during training & once you go home it's a 12%...which believe me isn't worth the stress the job brings on. You have to endure being tethered to a phone all day like a dog on a leash taking back to back to back calls, expect to take at least 70 calls a day. The calls come in so quick you can't even take a sip of water! You have to deal with people wanting to check their balance, wonder where their checks are, yell at you because they overdrafted their account & there's nothing you can do to help them. There's no particular way on how to handle a call, it's all up to your discretion which I think is terrible. A customer can get three different answers from three different people. There's not even consistency with the training, it's all based on what mentor you work with & how you will be told to perform your job. One consistency is don't hang up on customers or use foul language, other than that- figure it out! Their point of reference once you go home is to utilize the intranet or reach out to peer support via a telephone - more...","Support Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 28, 2018","2.0"
