5875,"Great benefits, low compensation","A typical day was assisting customers, while trying to meet sales goals. Although there is a lot of talk about advancement and growth, it is pretty difficult to move from the retail side, if you find that sales is not your niche. I witnessed this with several of my co workers. The hardest part was adjusting to playing the role of a personal banker, while still being a teller, and not being compensated for the extra work, training, etc. this bank pays well if you meet sales goals, in their incentive pay...if you are not a teller. They pay $6 for each DDA acct (checking/savings) for tellers, but, pay bankers and teller supervisors more. There is no job security in the retail side of banking, as everything is heading to the technology side.

The management is lazy and barely ever held accountable for mistakes, slacking, ect, but they come down so hard on normal employees for absolutely anything. I've worked in both the corporate and retail sides of this company. If you're interested, I recommend corporate (customer service, collections, data entry) because the retail employees (bankers, tellers, ect) get treated with far less respect. On the corporate side there is a great sense of 'togetherness' amongst the team, there are company picnics, sporting events, outings, volunteer opportunities, free stuff and giveaways all the time and it's just a great, fast paced environment. I had to leave because the work life balance is simply not there on the corporate side. Overall, pretty decent place to work for.

That is unless you are one of those crazy people that enjoy retail banking. Despite what this bank preaches, the in-store positions offer limited opportunity for growth and awful hours including mandatory three weekends a month (though depending on your branch manager, that maybe flexible) If this bank was the Mormon church, the in-store FSCs are the missionaries they send out on bikes to go door to door to spread the beliefs of the Mormon Church, except in store FSCs go aisle to aisle of the Giant grocery stores, marketing this bank. (I could go on and on with that comparison, but I'll just leave it at that) The one good thing about the position, unlike most retail banks this bank sales goals are relatively low, lower bonus levels are easily obtainable (though not really lucrative) and they aren't too strict on under-performing FSCs (yet.
