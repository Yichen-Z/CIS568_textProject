With managing I have also learned how to understand co-workers personalities and how to approach co-workers the right way to get the task done right the first time. The hardest part of my job is making cold calls for sales opportunities. I would much rather pitch a product that I believe would truly help my clients financial well-being, rather than just pushing any product.

I learned to drive a bigger vehicle than what I have and different routes such as different places in New Jersey. Management was ok and co-workers the same. The hardest part of the job was when I was locked in between two steel doors for more than a hour and not being able to come out until someone would come or answer the walkie talkie.
