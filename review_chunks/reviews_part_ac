"Branch Banker - Pressure Overload/Miserable"," this bank loves to underpay & overwork you. Long hours (if you have family or doctor appointments, or other commitments - they are not privy to accommodating very much & if they do it's always an issue) - they preach work life balance but will be micro aggressive with you when you use your time. Workplace culture is toxic, managers are so stressed out & dump so much pressure onto employees & bankers & it makes for an overall miserable experience. Pay is horrid, only good if you're a single individual - not good for a living wage especially considering cost of living in NJ.Most enjoyable part of the job was going home.","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Clifton, NJ","June 4, 2021","2.0"

But it's not overly fulfilling work and often times I don't feel like we have a clear vision of what we're doing. Seems like every few weeks/months we're jumping on the latest and greatest technology or idea. Also, it takes an act of God to get anything done. So much red tape it's ridiculous. And, as a developer, I find it very hard to get my job done when the security measures on my laptop block me from accessing websites and running software I need to perform every day job task.

The previous manager, he was a team player and helped all his employees manage customer flow open accounts whatever he needed to do. The newer manager has now lost almost all the previous employees due to her mismanagement and causing issues due to confidentiality with each employee.

Most of my time at my branch, we had either no manager, no teller lead, or a bad manager and a bad teller lead. We were always under-staffed. Lunch breaks weren't guaranteed, but you also get in trouble for eating behind the counter. Who cares about your health, right? Anyone with any sort of management position is a snob and thinks they can talk down to you because they're slightly less underpaid to deal with all of this than you are. Seriously don't work here.

We're considered full staff, but struggle completing required daily/ weekly/ monthly tasks because we're too busy. We're expected to get good surveys, but its hard when customers have to wait in line for long periods of time due to lack of staff and also because this bank expects us to push sales and not rush to get the lines down.

Management would become intentionally intimidating and even threatening, implying our jobs were at stake. The morale of my particular branch became so intense and toxic that myself and two others (out of 4 bankers) left. The hours at my location were 8-6 and Saturday's 9-2 and it made my work life balance almost unbearable. My time there was definitely rewarding as far as what I learned and will be able to build from but extremely difficult and hard to please upper management. They will run you ragged and expect the impossible all while putting on a smile wondering why you feel the way you do. This is a great position for someone starting out but I would do my time and go. this bank sells you sunshine and rainbows only to give you extreme stress and expectations that are almost impossible for even the most experienced banker to achieve.

"No real advancement opportunities.","The harder you work and the more you succeed, the more they want to keep you where you are for the same pay rate. It's universal throughout the company. If you don't go into their weird management training program out of college you have no real shot at advancement here. Coming from a top performer in the Consumer Loans department for 4 years I can tell you, the ceiling is definitely not glass. Where they hire you is where they want to keep you.

"Decent","I was with the company for a long time. From the beginning to the end was a dramatic change. When I started there was a great work life balance and you only worked 5 days a week with regular Saturdays off. At the end you worked every day, but Sunday and getting a Saturday off it was very difficult. You also had to schedule all vacation and PTO in January. So if you needed a last minute doctor appointment, or family conflict later in the year, you had to request to move your days around. Which, might not be approved if someone else requested it off. There was very little room for advancement, even with a decent turn over. Upper management expects tip-top sales. You need to be at the utmost top of the list and you need to harass customers constantly for more sales. You're expected to make a product recommendation to every customer every time. This wouldn't be so bad, except the same customers come in all the time. Eventually, they get really frustrated and annoyed and stop coming in. Then, you're expected to make sales calls and stay late to call customers and ask them to come in for appointments, even to the point of harassment. A system generated list appears and you must contact everyone on the list, even you just called them two weeks ago. ","Teller","Former Employee","Cambridge, OH","March 20, 2021","3.0"
"Decent Job","Its working a bank. lots of customer service, so if thats your thing, then this is the job for you. the other thing you may not be told or realize is this bank requires you to be a salesperson. They will play it off like they are helping customers, but they just reward people who churn out numbers. credit cards, loans. The idea is to get as many as possible. if you don't meet your goals because your clientele is declined repeatedly or can't afford loans and credit card debt, it isn't taken into consideration. Just the results are. It is a good company to work for. fantastic benefits. just very sales oriented and that isn't stressed during the hiring process.

"Not a lot of advancement","Although there are plenty of opportunities within the company it is harder for some positions to move up without starting all over with that positions base pay.

They value your work ethic and challenge you to do better everyday so you can advance and achieve your goals. They offer competitive pay rates and a great benefits package including 401k matching and generous PTO with paid holidays. With that being said, they do expect you to earn those benefits. There are sales goals to meet and that can be challenging with the other tasks you are expected to complete throughout the day (Such as answering the phone, balancing a drawer, holding appointments, & various office tasks). Ensuring the customer's financial wellbeing is sound is their main focus and some customers do not wish to listen when you offer the advice or product.

The CEO is great and they try to maintain an inclusive culture. Management in my department was great but I can't speak for other departments.

At the same time, coworkers were helpful and knowledgeable. Training team was nice and manager did all she could to help me progress. If you don't want to stay in retail or customer service, stay away. Time off worked on a seniority basis, didn't matter if you put it in months ahead.

"Productive, Fun depends on your TL, Busy ","I do not feel the same about this bank. As I use to. 1. The biggest reason is *No Merit Increase* you want to work a person in three different departments, and No increase. You can do that to others, that may say *Well okay I will accept that* but others will not accept it. I have been through a couple of Acquisitions, with former companies, and my pay actually went up! Not stay the same! No, at this bank. This year there is no pay increase* seems it fell right in line with the Acquisition that just happened. 2. I was on a Team that had no morale. Some had no drive to want to have fun, the TL did not push fun, was dry, and really did not do much. Was behind the scenes hiding, only gave recognition to whom she knew the longest. Some Agents had terrible attitudes, but this could have came from the energy from the TL. 3. The OLD systems we work off of are horrible, too many steps to do anything, this bank took too long to get innovative with their systems *and you have ridiculous Merits to meet* QA is not consistent, some TL's you have to pull teeth to get them to dispute a SET score, some TL's do not acknowledge each Agent for good work. 4. I did not want to go by the career reviews for this bank. But they sure were true. It also seems like greed toke over, and after the acquisition *it was we have to think about this bank pockets.* 5. Some Agents be like *At least you have a job* as if this bank is the only place to work. ","Customer Service and Support Representative","Former Employee","Remote","March 5, 2021","3.0"

"High Stress, Low Pay","There is not a good work-life balance at this bank. I am constantly working through lunch breaks and past my scheduled shift. The workload and responsibilities of this role are not compensated on a fair basis. You will be expected to take on an excessive amount of work with little to no training. I have constantly been lied to regarding raises, workload, and career progression throughout my time with this bank. Managers are scheduled in meetings all day and are not supportive. Upper management has no idea what is actually going on for front-line employees, yet they are the ones that dictate the processes and systems we use. There is also a large disconnect among different internal departments with no departments wanting to claim ownership for work and other issues. This ultimately will fall back on my role to take care because we have the most contact with the customers. This requires us to work on issues and research solutions that we don't have the tools for, all on top of our normal workload. You will find yourself working well outside of the job description with little to no extra incentives with this bank. Fully expect to be lied to regarding pay progression, career progression, and workload when working for this bank.

"Good company to work for. Depending on what position you are in."," this bank as a company is good to work for. Be careful which position you chose.

"Very Hostile Job Environment","This is not a good place to work. this bank Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to them. If a manager feels threatened, they will do everything they can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group. They claim they provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen. The amount the company raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year. So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases. There are plenty more Financial Service Companies out there, I suggest you look somewhere else.","AML Risk specialist III","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 19, 2021","1.0"

"Back to back phone calls and crunched on time","While the pay and benefits are decent and there is paid time off, the job itself is quite stressful with panicked and stressed out customers calling in, often with complex banking issues. Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and they treat you like a customer. When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time. You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete it with the customer on the line. You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do. Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet their own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another. There are many positive aspects to this job including benefits and the way you can call in sick or schedule vacation is very independent, you don't need to tell your boss any personal details, just that you won't be in.You just call the call off line. The sent beautiful flowers to my brothers funeral when I had to call in to attend the funeral, which was incredibly caring. There are a lot of resources for a wide range of things, as long as you know where to look.

Nickel-and-dime is what they do best. And salaries are no exception. Although I was able to negotiate a salary commensurate with where I live, I was never able to get a salary raise as the base salary for a big metro area like NYC or DC is far higher than the top earners in the Cleveland, Ohio/Pittsburgh PA market, where most of staff are based.The politics and diversity (lack there of) mimics the state of the nation. Expect nothing different there. The one thing I can say is that women are empowered at this bank and they are very much in leadership positions every where you look.Some areas adopt change and are forward thinking and adapt modern practices.

Training was awful as instructors never actually showed you how to do anything. We were also consistently under-staffed during my time there so we always worked six days a week. You are consistently micromanaged by your manager and after every customer you are criticized for not making a sale and instead of coaching and training the manager would just tell me what I did wrong and would consistently talk bad behind employees backs.

I went on medical leave and when I came back, my position was switched by my direct manager to a floater position where I had to drive 2 hours to get to any onsites. Spoke to HR and nothing could be done. The decision did not make success in my role conducive since most of my time was spent driving. My advice when working here: Don't get sick, don't seek surgery to get well or you may not have your position to come back to. Also, this is a dead end role even if you are a rock star with your goals. Many of my team members have been in this role for years (as much as 13 years) and have not gotten promoted or considered.

Personally, the quality of my customer interactions took priority over my own metrics, which became a topic of conversation during personal coaching meetings. However, my experience with this bank as a company, was very positive. The environment was always supportive, inclusive, and motivating. There were many resources available to all employees within the call center such as resume workshops, public speaking and leadership groups, and career corner opportunities (where you can learn more about other careers within the call center). this bank also had a comprehensive benefits package (including health/life/vision/dental insurance, 14 days of PTO given each calendar year, occasional VTO offered, up to 6 paid sick days, HSA, ISP 401k, FMLA, pension plan, home buying assistance, employee specific APRs on credit cards/loans, separate rooms within call center for nursing mothers, etc.).

"A good stepping stone","It's a good company to get your feet wet in banking. The pay is not very good. But the time off is great. 3 weeks when you start. There's not a lot of communication between upper management to employees. That's pretty much the same in most departments I've worked in. My coworkers are fantastic and I love them.","Loan Analyst Collateral Monitoring, Commercial Loans","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","January 23, 2021","3.0"

"It could be as good or as bad as the branch you work at"," this bank can be EXTREMELY toxic or very, very good; depending on your branch and 'leaders'. It is VERY sales-driven, and there is not necessarily room to grow a career. They don't pay enough for all the work they require from you, customers can be very moody/rude. High turnover rate, and extremely under-staffed branches. Most of the time you have so much work, that you will leave something 'hanging', and most likely will be called out for it. God forbid a customer leaves a bad review. It's gonna hurt you and the branch, so it adds an additional layer of stress. ","Banker","Current Employee","New Jersey","January 18, 2021","3.0"
"I would not recommend working at this bank to my worst enemy."," this bank has laid off over half of their workforce, including full time employees, completely without warning. They also gave no separation package at all, and cut benefits the day after the layoff. Further, employees worked upwards of 150% hours during Covid, and were not compensated for that either. this bank is a corporate monster, and does not care for the employees or their families at all.

"Mostly focused on metrics. ","Everything is metrics driven. Not much support offered after training. Reaching out to Retail Support consist of someone sending an article to research and find your solution. Tenured employees have later shifts and new hires get earlier shifts.

"Doing better with technology","I spent a little over a decade at this bank and during that time they started getting serious about putting into place updated technology. They went from old stuff to newer tech. That part was good. One part that wasn't good is that management was hit or miss. For the last 5 or 6 years I had a manager who really didn't do much to help with advancement or getting the training needed to do better. And then his manager made vacation taking difficult, especially around Christmas and New Years. ","Support","Former Employee","Portland, OR","January 4, 2021","3.0"
"Bank teller","Decent bank to work for but the pay is low, and you always have to sell all sorts of financial products, credit cards, to people that don't have money anyway. So why induce people to get in more debt when you see they already don't have money. There are monthly goals that probably no bank/branch achieves but are there to put you in a hot spot. Worked here while in college. After graduation I moved on to a better stable and nice job. don't't work in banks. They're so unethical ( what a shocker, of course they are). ","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Fairfax County, VA","January 4, 2021","3.0"
"Diversity was the only plus","Everything else was awful. Being a call center, you have to take way too many calls. You literally do not have a full second between calls, the second a customer disconnects there is another customer already speaking. They literally track your bathroom time. Everyday you have a 15 min team meeting with about 10 ppl in the middle of hundreds of other employees and they rate you on about 8 different Categories. They put this huge board and write in red marker everything you did wrong. It's awful. ","Customer Care Consultant","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 30, 2020","1.0"
"Good","I feel that this bank is a great company to work for.

","Credit Card Specialist","Current Employee","Remote","December 30, 2020","3.0"
"Good job but it can be stressful and disheartening","The customers reviews on your service can make or break your experience here. If the ATM doesn't work and the customer gives this bank (you) a 1 star rating, it destroys not only your quarter but the branches, too. You meet wonderful regulars and build relationships but survey and sale expectations are unreasonable.","Part Time Teller","Former Employee","Michigan","December 29, 2020","3.0"

"Worst working environment. ","The environment at this job was one of the worse. It was extremely stressful and unfriendly. Most of the management was impolite and rude. It encouraged separation amongst employees, as opposed to team work. They didn't want us speaking to each other. There were a multitude of changes that occurred quite often with poor training. The environment is too uptight and not employee friendly. ","Online Banking Consultant","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 24, 2020","3.0"
"Horrible place to work!!! They do not care about customers ","Most promotions will not be people of color. Customers are not put first. It takes months to get loans closed because departments are fighting internally. You can escalate to management and nothing will happen. Worst company I've ever worked for in 25 years. They will lie to you during the interview and tell you that everybody is earning a bonus, that isn't true. They find ways not to pay you a bonus. You will not even understand how you earned or didn't earn a bonus. It's some gorilla math equation that they have on an excel sheet and you don't get a copy. Again the worst company ever. Talk a great game but it's all lies!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend anyone work here and I never have. ","Loan Processor","Current Employee","Jacksonville, FL","December 22, 2020","1.0"

"It's alright"," this bank is fine. The salary is not where it should be considering how much they make you do and the size of the bank but you do get a minimum of 3 weeks of vacation. Benefits are fine. Moving up is very difficult as HR gate-keeps a lot. Everyone seems to work a lot, managers included (avg 45-50 hrs/wk). this bank talks a big game about being customer-centered but they are not. I worked in the branches and in an operational capacity and I can tell you that this bank makes it hard for customers to anything in a modern, easy way. Now if you're struggling to find a job/need some experience or get your foot in the door of the banking world then it's not a terrible first step. But get your 1-2 years and get out because raises are nonexistent and the workload only increases.","Branch Banker Associate","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","December 15, 2020","3.0"
"Good place to work sometimes"," this bank is a good company to work for most of the time. They are pretty easy going when you hit all of your goals, however when you don't, get ready to hear your manager micro-manage you all day long and repeatedly tell you what to do. They offer little to no salary increases on a yearly basis.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Washington, DC","December 15, 2020","4.0"

"Horrible- stay away from AML","Stay far away from AML here. They do not pay well, they bring in new people with higher salaries but make the wrong decision on who to hire. Raises are a joke! Even with meeting and exceeding all goals you get 1%!! We daily work overtime but are salaried for 40 hours, we work between 55-80 hours a week with no choice, we work on vacations, we work on 'paid holidays'. We always work, we are treated like garbage, they pick apart any mini mistake you make from typos to attachments, you better no reach out to management or you will get talked down to for even speaking to them. They hold round tables with high ups where you can't even express things because others tell management and you get in trouble. Turnover is insane here for these reasons and more. We have QAs, investigators, managers and analysts quitting daily or weekly. Stay away!! Any bank is better! ","AML Investigator QA","Current Employee","North Carolina","December 11, 2020","2.0"
"Good Company: Horrible with internal advancement","The company overall is very good. However, even for top performers, the ability to get meaningful pay raises year over year is extremely limited.

"Universal Banker","The good: The compensation for the Universal Banker role is pretty good, and you do really well with referrals, selling credit cards, and meeting your quarterly quota, you get decent bonuses. The workload is pretty decent, I guess it also depends what your branch is like.The neutral:The products are just like any other bank, the difference is how they name them. It's important to go over all the fees with customers when you open accounts because some caught me off guard (example: when you can charge for a replacement card/when not to charge)The bad:I've noticed a lot of turnover lately with bakers and managers; and when you don't have a branch or assistant manager to guide you through your first few weeks, your constantly looking up policies and procedures by yourself, and trying to learn 3 different systems. In my specific branch my colleague have helped a bit, but I can't help but think they are planning an exit too. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Orlando, FL","December 6, 2020","3.0"

"Conservative company with poor management","Some successful people were terminated at this bank just because they reasonably complained about their branch manager's behavior. Instead of helping them, the higher management terminated them for a bogus reason. I worked with them personally and know what was going on. People can't speak out freely and are afraid of losing their jobs. I left because I realized that this bank is not the best place to develop as the bank encourages a hostile atmosphere in the branch. If you don't complain and meet their sales goals, you'd be most likely fine. Some branches, however, have great managers that value their employees, but those are rare. Other than that, if you work hard, you can earn good money there.","Service Associate II","Former Employee","Pennsylvania","November 25, 2020","2.0"

The training is horrible here and if a manager has it out for you for no reason other than they're bored or trying to look good to higher ups and money hungry, you're scared to lose your job. You're expected to know things you haven't been taught even in roles you haven't been in a full year and written up for not having enough appointments even during a pandemic.
