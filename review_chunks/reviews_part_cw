I was the 11th of 13 underwriters that left in a 4 month time period. Had I known what was in store for me with the new company that I went to, I would never have left this bank.

3706,"A Lot of give and Take","While working at this bank I have learned a lot about business and how it can mess with your life. Recently a whole department had been transferred from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. The training that was involved in this move was absolutely zero.

3709,"Hardworking, Fun with Opportunity!","Depending on the department and what you may like this bank is a great place to have a career start with plenty of opportunity to learn and grow. I was in customer service. The management wasn't the best nor the worst. The new manager of the entire building wasn't nice at all and if you didn't want to get to know more about her and how to be like her then she didn't treat you too well. You know 'suck up'!

3730,"Good company overall, but lots of room for improvement","Typical day to day includes assisting customer with a variety of banking needs and issues. Management (based off of location) is helpful to a point, but often is unavailable for assistance. Every day is different which is exciting but can also cause unneeded stress like most customer service related positions can be. Workplace culture is best described as 'every man for themselves' most days. A few colleagues will band together, but there is a lot of disconnect between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of my day is definitely helping clients reach their financial goals. Nothing makes me more excited to walk in the front door, than knowing I can help someone get out of debt, or buy a new house for their family. It is very rewarding during those times of the day.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 12, 2017","3.0"

3740,"Great place to work overall","While I am at this bank it is teaching me the value of people. I service all ethics and many different cultures. The Branch I work at is a steady pace but always busy on the 1st and 3rd. The Pay could be more for the work we do but the benefits help balance that out. I learned to identify false checks, suspicious deposits, and robbery patterns. Our branch was one of few that passed the yearly audit, which I was proud. I had the chance to do teller work as well, but mostly I was a banker","Banker","Current Employee","Dayton, OH","May 11, 2017","1.0"
3741,"i like my branch but do not care for the company as a whole","I have always been a hard worker, so working Is not an issue for me. but it becomes one when I am doing a ton load of work and not being compensated for it. I currently run all ATMS in my branch by myself because no one else is trained to do so. I should only be responsible for one. I also have clearance to do supervisor duties and task but I'm only a titled as a teller and receive teller pay. I even applied for the job and was denied it, even though I am currently 'doing' the job now and has been for the past month. there has been other people here for many years and they said it has been years since the even got a raise in pay. and there are many days we don't even get a lunch because of staffing issues. my branch manager is awesome though and the only reason why this bank got this much of my time","Teller","Current Employee","Ohio","May 11, 2017","2.0"
3742,"Decent place to work....","Nice people to work with. I enjoyed the customer interactions. The training outside of the branch was great but the on-the-job training was non-existent. I wasn't put in a position to succeed. Money wasn't bad, but it was very stressful being put into situations where you didn't know what to do and I couldn't go to anyone in the branch for help. Their answer was for me to use the company intranet or to call branch support. Not conducive for success. At least not for me.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Former Employee","South Carolina","May 10, 2017","2.0"

3746,"Working for this bank","As I thrived for excellence and advancement, I ran into the obstacles of my first few weeks of physical training to be nonconstructive and passive at times. As I asked questions, gave my time to learn and be attentive I was more so rather ignored, undervalued and not trained to the best of my potential. this bank offers great benefits and I sacrifice my learning attributes. The company has much to offer but as I started from the ground up my foundation was not at all of that, that this bank I believe truly had to offer all around.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Sylvania, OH","May 10, 2017","3.0"
3747,"Great place to work"," this bank really is a great place to work. Though the compensation is not as high as other banks, there are many benefits and rewards that make up for it, including bonus money. It does seem hard to move into management positions from within the company, as I've seen less qualified individuals get jobs that I have applied for with little or no business or management experience.","SERVICE ASSOCIATE","Current Employee","Canton, OH","May 10, 2017","5.0"
3748,"Management","Management for this bank was very lacking. They didn't know how to do their own job and tried to teach you how to do your own.
