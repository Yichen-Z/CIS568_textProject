A lot of calls I received were elderly customers and you practically had to push them off the phone while being nice. Not to mention being called names by angry customers on a constant basis. Management does not care if you have any sort of sickness. Training was a nightmare and we sat in a classroom for 3 weeks. One of the most important things you learn at the last minute. Also the material you learn in the classroom doesn't even get used while you're on the call or are told that it is incorrect. They do not reimburse you if you work from home.
