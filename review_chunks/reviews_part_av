But their real objective is to squeeze every dime possible out of each customer. While this is the objective of most companies that answer to stock holders, it is especially true here. What is truly best for the customer is secondary to production and pushing this bank products and services. As an employee, you are not encouraged to think outside the box but are very encouraged to drink the corporate Kool-Aid, shut up and do what you're told.
