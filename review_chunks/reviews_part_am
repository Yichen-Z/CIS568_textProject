I say with because they do whatever they can to include you as a part of the team rather than some they pay. this bank's training is the best I've had. The hardest part of my job was working from home and making that transition. That type of work is for some people and not for others. Unfortunately, it was not for me. this bank also does not let you transition back if you find it unfitting.

"Stressful"," this bank, when hiring tellers, should let interviewees know that they are basically being hired to sell and telemarket. If you reach your goals you're told to do more. If you don't meet your goals you will be disciplined or they will find reasons to replace you. Teller skills are not at the top of their list of requirement. It's all about the sales.

"Some areas are better than others....","There are some great aspects to working for this company -- some locations offer casual attire and some business units are permitted to WFH, with reasonable limitations when you do WFH. You get to work with a wide array of people across locations - which is both challenging and interesting. There is talk about 'challenging the status quo' but should you levy a challenge it is often not well received. There is frequent change of leadership with in the teams - which is disruptive and prevents continuity. They do have a liberal internal job posting practice, but moving with in can be challenging. Despite qualifications for open positions. hiring is based more on who you know than what you know - which is extremely discouraging. I feel there is not a gender pay gap at this company. The pay grades and comp structure is based on the job - not who fulfills it. Which is a plus! The typical work day is filled with conference calls. Some of which are helpful, others that are not a good use of ones time. Health benefits are not great. Plans have a high deductible and out of pocket expenses. They are generous with vacation time, etc. After you meet a required time of service you can even purchase another weeks vacation. Most managers are accommodation with Dr's appts etc. For those considering working here, i would ask questions during the interview process and make sure you are comfortable before you accept any offers. If you want to achieve a certain level, career wise, ask what you need to do etc. Career path'ing is NOT a strong point at this company.

"Do not fall for their promises","Micromanagement at its best. All about sales and numbers at the end of the day, despite what they tell you. If you are a seasoned banker, stay away from them. this bank wants inexperienced people so they can mold them into what they think a banker should be. They do not value experience. Pay is woefully short compared to their competitors. They think their process is the end all to be all. If there is a problem, they believe the people are the problem and not their process.

"Flexible work environment, but there are trade-offs","There are pluses and minuses to working at this bank. Positives - flex schedule and work from home, Negative - heavy outsourcing with sub-par quality workers, heavy process, and slow to implement. If you work here, expect heavy process and strict procedures, many constraints to performing your job, mass approvals needed for just about everything, and an 'over-the-top' amount of required documentation. The approval process is so heavy that it loses the intent, i.e., approvers select 'approved' without reviewing. The company tries to cut costs by outsourcing to OffShore and OnShore (non-US citizen) resources, but quality suffers. Cultural differences are apparent in quality of work, work ethic, and efficiency. Projects take an unreasonable amount of time to complete, and end up being costly. I wish upper management would understand that they are losing quality employees to less qualified, and less dedicated employees. The non-US contracted resources are initially less expensive, but end up costing the company and shareholders much more. On the up-side, the company tries to institute a work-life balance during the holidays, and avoids scheduling production deployments during these times. The work from home option is wonderful. It saves on commute time, and provides a quieter environment to work.","Technology Project Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","April 28, 2018","4.0"

"Customer Care Center is Cancer","Customer care center should have been a path to other positions within the company. You learn a lot about banking here and deal with customer over the phone, but the care center is dead end position. You can advance within the telephone center but outside of that it's impossible. You are on a tight schedule as they monitor your work time on the phone. And when I had scheduled time off to talk with HR, they missed my appointment twice. They offered little more than, 'Oh, I forgot.' I started with a training class of 30 people after 1 year there was 5 of us left. All fired or quit.
