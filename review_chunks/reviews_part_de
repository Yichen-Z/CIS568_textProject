4105,"Low pay, horrible management, no team work","Would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a career in banking. There's few advancement possibilities and the pay is terrible. Managers are all about themselves and there is no teamwork. It's nothing but a competition when it comes to meeting sales goals. They depend on Gallup surveys to see how well employees perform and when you get a bad score they make you feel like scum.

The culture is inclusive and focused on teamwork. They do well with recognizing employees who go above and beyond. Unfortunately, their salaries ranges are not very competitive as you move up in sales positions and management. Retail management compensation does not equate to the work load and responsibilities.

Had time for family and the pay was great.With new management they extended the working house plus you always have to stay longer if there are shortages or overages on the teller line (which happens almost every day). You can't plan your life with this job. Even when you off or on vacation you will always receive stressing calls from managers or co-workers. Mandatory no overtime which is sucks. Schedule planning is horrible. You work 40 hours/week for 6 days (sometimes 7 days). The biggest and annoying part of this job was the call nights or multi-channel calls.

4126,"Great Perks, low costing benefits","Wonderful company to work for, however there is a trade for the perks and that's the pay. Perks are good especially holidays and health, pay is low. It's banking so you get days off another career wouldn't normally offer. Lots and lots of time off, 3 weeks vacation, 1 personal day, 5 sick days; if you are on written warning or the sort for absences, the fault is all yours. The supervisors are great they'll move you up if you're good! I've worked at worse places when it comes to perks, but the pay was way higher.
