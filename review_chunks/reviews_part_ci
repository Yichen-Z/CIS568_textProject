3002,"Great Place to Work","A typical day at this bank would start off with a short meeting about goals and what the focus is for the day. You will get the opportunity to learn as much as you can. Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking. My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to that plan. That's the best way to succeed. The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet. The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with the territory. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for it among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner. I LOVED working here. if you can manage stress well and are extremely competitive then this job is great for you.","Teller Supervisor II","Former Employee","Washington, DC","December 14, 2017","4.0"

3011,"Competitive workplace, nowhere to excel","Tellers would often bicker and get jealous from one another. A lot of pointless drama no matter what branch you're at. Turnover is so high that this bank gave the tellers raises but management shows a lack of appreciation for employees because they come and go. Pay was decent hours are not flexible because the bank is only open so many hours. Very strict policy and procedures because you're dealing with money and personal information of the customers.

3033,"Terrible place to work!!","I worked for this bank for 3+ years and the environment is great, but the management is terrible, the expectations are high and unrealistic. The pay is terrible as well, and fun fact this bank employees make the same amount as Aldi cashiers (how?). Oh and if you quit or get fired all paid vacation time has to be paid back. The turn over rate for this bank is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact). So if you don't mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you're willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than this bank is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time. It's not worth the stress and headache.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","December 5, 2017","1.0"
3034,"Meh","I worked in a call center in Pittsburgh. The Good: They offer competitive pay. I was making $16.58 or something like that. The turnover is so bad they almost have to. On that note, you can tell the company is trying really hard to make it a good place to work, so maybe it wasn't at the top of it's game when I left, but it's heading in a really good direction. The Bad: You are literally just getting yelled out by customers who can't manage their money and need someone else to blame. What's worse is this bank does not care.","Customer Service Support Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 5, 2017","3.0"

3048,"Great benefits, poor communication","The company treats their employees well as far as benefits and vacation, but they do not communicate well from the higher executives down to the management teams that you see in branches. The execs create extremely unrealistic goals because they are unaware of what it is really like to work in the branches.
