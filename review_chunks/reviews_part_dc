4012,"Great corporate company but retail banking is lacking"," this bank is an advanced company with great benefits. The pay is very low in comparison with other banks and for what you are expected to do. It is a pushy sales environment because that is the only way employees can make any extra money. The benefits are great except for the health insurance. The sales nature of the business puts employees in competitive situations which causes a lot of drama in the branches. People are fighting over referrals and doing unethical things to make more money. Management encourages this because their bonus is based off of the branches referrals. The managers are not qualified. Just because you have a degree does not mean that you are a good leader. The turnover rate would be lower if they actually invested in their employees. But you can't do that when the branches are always short staffed because they don't pay enough.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Manteo, NC","February 8, 2017","2.0"

4019,"People Who Care But Are Not Cared For","Work life balance is miserable, the department is under-staffed, pay is too low to incentivize people to stay, trainers are overwhelmed with constant new hires and floor-level managers are far more stressed than they should be because upper management keeps pushing for them to have good performance despite their undertrained staff. Training timetables are repeatedly rolled back to have enough people on the phones and it noticeably affects the quality of the work. The incentive to perform is based on avoiding things you will be punished for rather than bonuses for meeting or beating goals. Again, the pay for the work is laughable, there are factory jobs in town requiring no computer skills or extensive training that pay as much or better than this position. Upper management is utterly unwilling to invest in the base-pay and number of staff necessary to keep the call center operating as intended. If you're going to be temporarily 'stuck' someplace it's better than a minimum wage job, by far, but for any kind of substantive, appreciable career-type job it falls depressingly short as an employer. Everyone in town seems to know someone who worked there, and they do, because the rate of turnover is so high just about everyone in town -has- worked there. A better place to be from than to be at.","Detection and Investigation Analyst","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","February 6, 2017","2.0"

They do not push goals so hard but you still have to meet your goals. My manager was awesome! Working in the branch you had to go into the aisles and talk to customers who were really focused on getting their groceries. It is a lot of standing and walking the grocery store.
