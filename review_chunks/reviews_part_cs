3504,"this bank","One of the best banking call center environments Ive worked for. not only are they very flexible with schedule but they do every they can to show that they care about their employees.","Customer Care Rep","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","July 18, 2017","5.0"
3505,"Wonderful Employer","I've been with this bank for almost 2 years now. This is a good company to work for. I started off in regular customer service and a year later took a job in business banking. There is so much room for advancement here as long as you do your job. I would definitely recommend working for this bank. It's not just a job, as it can lead to a career. I don't plan on leaving this bank and hope to keep advancing.!","Business Banking Representative","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 17, 2017","5.0"

3507,"Advancement Issues","I was hired at this bank as a contract employee. My contract was to consist of 3 months with possibility of conversion to Full Time status. I was first extended at the end of my 3rd month for an additional 3 months. Then, extended again for another 3 months. Totaling 9 months.","Operations Specialist","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 16, 2017","3.0"
3508,"You'l never be enough","The goals they have given to tellers are insane and completely unachievable. Even if you miraculously it the minimum requirements to earn incentives and keep your job, it won't be recognized and no matter what you do it'll never be enough.","Teller","Former Employee","Bay City, MI","July 16, 2017","2.0"
3509,"High Stress / High Demand Workplace","Always being 'coached' and pushed to SELL. Goals are unrealistic. Plan to work overtime and 6 days a week. Always under-staffed and the managers rarely work extra hours, especially Saturdays. No written warnings if you make a mistake, they just fire you on Friday afternoon.","Teller","Former Employee","Louisville, KY","July 16, 2017","2.0"
3510,"Benefits are good but no work life balance","Not every department has the same expectations and shifts and bonuses are different in each department. Some departments do not offer bonuses and won't allow you to request time off unless you use your vacation time and that has to be available that day that you need off. No one really cares what you have going on outside of this bank and you can trade shifts with co workers but if your department isn't 24 hours and you can only trade with people on your shift that males trading difficult because more than likely everyone just about works the same shift. Money is great for a full time employee every two weeks buy be prepared to eat, sleep, and breathe nothing but this bank!","Customer Service","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI 49009","July 15, 2017","5.0"
3511,"Have to meet your goals","If you do not meet your goals then you will be written up. It is very stressful when the pressure is on you to meet the companies quota. You do not want to harass customers and force them into loans and credit cards if they do not want it. the company doesn't care. they want accounts opened and loans approved.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Oxon Hill, MD","July 14, 2017","1.0"

3513,"HORRIBLE place to Work!!!","I started with a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there. When this bank come along, they tried EVERYTHING to cut my salary...said $29,000 was WAY over their pay scale for a Customer Service Rep!!! After many unsuccessful attempts, they called me & another lady that had been there for 14 years, into an office and said they were letting us go...but we would get a severance package. The day AFTER I found a new job, I was told by management that they now needed me....and when I said no, I was let go with NO SEVERANCE whatsoever!!!! The only thing this bank cares about is making money, NOT about the customers!!!","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Graham, NC","July 13, 2017","1.0"
3514,"this bank","I worked here for 10 years. I began as a receptionist and ended as a paralegal in ERISA compliance. Overall the Bank was a very good place to work. It provided a reasonable compensation partnered with a very nice benefits package. Save only one, my immediate supervising managers were exceptional and very responsive to my work place needs. I became one of the 'casualties' in a Bank wide downsizing.","Paralegal","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 13, 2017","4.0"

3517,"Work with good people","I really enjoy the people I work with and the atmosphere that my peers would create. My immediate supervisor was good to work with as well. Maybe not as hands on as what is needed, but assisted in other ways. The problem is the goals. There is still what I call a 'Wells Fargonian' mentality driven by our upper management to push products, hit monthly and quarterly selling goals and not ever talk or concern themselves about the incredible service we provide, but rather how much money did we make the company.","Financial Advisor","Current Employee","Battle Creek, MI","July 13, 2017","3.0"
3518,"Low pay for what is expected.","I had a great branch manager and district manager. Just way too much put on your plate.

3519,"terrible management led me to quit","I was treated horrifically once promoted and moved to a different location to work. I was thrown in with minimal training and held to unrealisitically high standards. I did not like what was told to me, how I was treated compared to the other employees, how I was pushed to do all the work and forced to train employees, while the manager only pushed me and gave severe punishment for falling behind in the pile of work she never gave me the chance to do.","Full Time Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Claymont, DE","July 13, 2017","2.0"

3524,"this bank is a place of structure and excellence, always looking to propel other's into their future.","One thing I learned is this, I cannot allow the personalities of people to be the set thermometer of the overall vision, but rather realize we are all a gathered people who are set to reach one common goal and that is to increase the value of the company and to change the overall demographics of a culture, where, through the initiative of this bank every person, family, business, etc. is prospering. So as a company, this bank was great! this bank always made sure, through many on-line quizzes we, the frontline was sharp and knew how to effectively, with intentionality, meet the needs of our customers. And this bank has great honorary benefits for those who desire to put their best foot forward. They really do care.","Teller II","Former Employee","Schererville, IN","July 12, 2017","4.0"
3525,"Not able to grow unless you know someone","It is more about who you know versus what you know. People with no experience and education are promoted versus someone with experience or education, because of who they know. Benefits are terrible. You need a second job to pay for the high deductible insurance plans.","Business Systems Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 11, 2017","3.0"

3530,"Great job to move up"," this bank is a great place to work. This job has allowed me to learn different aspects of being a bank teller. Most people think being a teller is just counting out money to the customer. You actually do more than what meets the eye. You are working face to face with customers, meaning your skill need to be on point. You have to give the customers our undivided attention. You process many bank transactions, and managing a lot of cash during the day.","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Waldorf, Marylan","July 10, 2017","5.0"

3534,"Good company but some managers need training","On a typical day, it is business as usual and I learned to be self motivated. I worked under different managers, some very professional and pleasant to work with, others very poor at human relations. Workplace culture is good per company policies, but under a manager who is inexperienced or mischievous, workplace culture is nothing to write home about. The hardest part of the job is relating with managers who are not good. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what you are experienced at.","Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Laurel, MD","July 8, 2017","3.0"
3535,"A Good Place to start your career","Good place to start a career and find better employment.

Good people to work with but we are the hardest to do business with.","Operations Manager","Current Employee","Miamisburg, OH","July 8, 2017","3.0"
3536,"Disappointing work environment","I always heard great things about working for this bank, but after joining the team I was able to see a different side. I experienced a lack of leadership, the branch experienced a lack of support from upper management. For a 4-5 month period, including over the holidays which are the busiest times of the year, the branch was left with barely a staff. Many times there was only one teller when there needed to be three. The manager cared more about sales versus customer service, and many times would deceive the customer. The upper management was well aware of the problems in the branch and didn't seem to bother to help. As I kept working there I was starting to hear from other people in the company how it was changing and not for the better. If the right management was in place, the business and branch could have been very successful.","Sales Branch Sales and Service Specialist","Former Employee","Delaware County, PA","July 7, 2017","1.0"
