2300,"We are a technology company","We used to say we were a technology company, but our current CEO means it. Technology is no longer a cost center or order taker for business. IT must be the business and drive the future. this bank has many IT jobs, allows most IT employees to work from home 2 days a week and allows employees out of our footprint to work remotely. Some managers are sane, support their teams and keep the craziness in check. Others make a mockery of our value of Work/Life Balance demanding unsustainable effort. Every technologist will say quality is sacrificed to meet dates.","Cyber Security","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","July 24, 2018","4.0"

2307,"Supportive management great place to work","I moved up to supervisor after working in mail services as a clerk. I was mentored, supported and trained by many people in my group and grew my confidence in my learning on the job. I supported 7 to 2 people on my team in 5 years. After many process changes I managed and supported my team during challenging times without missing a beat or missing any SLA's. I coached and supported my team during time off and was always a working manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I problem solved for internal and external customers to came to a happy resolution. The hard part was coaching team members to give more than their job requires to help them see how important they were to our team and how much a difference they made in the company. I enjoyed working for a company who supported diversity and inclusion and everyone's opinions mattered.","Operations Supervisor I","Former Employee","Naperville, IL","July 22, 2018","5.0"

2312,"Its not for everyone","The call center, customer service industry is rapidly growing and pays well. The hours are very fixed, but there is always opportunity for OT hours. The hardest part of the job is not taking things personal, high stress, and fast paced. If you're a slow learner, this isn't for you. There isn't much room for upward mobility. The incentives that are given for meeting metrics, in my opinion make the work place culture disingenuous. Most likely, you'll be working from home. Most of the on-site call centers are closing. I do feel that this job strengthened my communication skills, and my ability to effectively multi task.","Customer Service Rep","Former Employee","Columbus, OH","July 20, 2018","3.0"

2320,"Nice pay but BRUTAL culture","Grateful for the experience,but this bank is trying to catch up with other National Banks and lacks the necessary sales platform needed to do so. this bank is still many years behind in innovation of bank software, user friendly online banking, and internal processes especially around investments. Jobs are threatened on a daily basis, and employees as a result live in constant fear...even if they are making their sales goals.","Banker","Former Employee","New Jersey","July 17, 2018","2.0"
2321,"Was great, now ok place to work","When I started in 2004, it was a great place to work, slowly over the years, especially since 2013, things changed.

2323,"Very Poor Pay","Even though I spent 6 years working for this company I would not recommend anyone working for this bank. My last annual raise was .05 cents. The turn over rate on branch managers was horrible.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Radcliff, KY","July 17, 2018","1.0"

2325,"Low pay and always fell short of their 'expectations'","From sales goals to customer service scores, it was nearly impossible to get a 'meets expectations' score on the annual performance review. The worst is the customer service scores. Customers are called anonymously by Gallup, and if the scores are not nearly perfect, then the branch doesn't get their incentive payout. And furthermore, the employee that received the lower score is placed on an 'action plan'. Action plans were common; an overshadow over every stressed employee that his/her job was always on the line.","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Vernon Hills, IL","July 16, 2018","3.0"

2329,"this bank","The work environment was always great and the people I worked with were easy to get along with. I traveled from branch to branch on a daily basis. It was difficult to adjust to each branches different set of rules. Management was unable to give definite answers, always felt like they were beating around the bush. At times it felt as though management was not there to support and develop you. The scheduling was pretty inconsistent, working Monday-Saturday and only having an hour trimmed here and there. Instead of a half day which most would expect and some got. But they insist on keeping you under 40 hours, and if you did by chance get overtime there were always questions about it. Training became too much at times. You'd finish one set of training and be assigned more to do. Sometimes you were required to travel for training. The incentive was quarterly, and sometimes felt like you weren't given enough opportunity to achieve it. In my time there I learned a lot about the financial industry.","Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Wintersville, OH","July 16, 2018","2.0"
2330,"Overall a good place to work","Loved my customers. My manager was fantastic. Manager Really supported the staff daily and in career advancement. Co-workers were absolutely great to work with, however, I did find it to have a clique. Did not enjoy having to push the products onto customers. Also, every week having to call the customers to arrange for appointments so that they could push the products, when it was not in job description.","Teller","Former Employee","West Ocean City, MD","July 14, 2018","5.0"

2336,"Management Issues","You are in so many meetings you have no time to do actual work yet they don't want you charging overtime. Management does not communicate with each other well and therefore are unable to throttle information down to employees effectively. Project managers are brought in brand new to the company and changed mid-project and there seems to be virtually no turnover.","Business Systems Analyst II","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","July 13, 2018","2.0"
2337,"Not as great as it used to be.","Job in the branches is now more like telemarketing position. Have to make outbound calls to try and get customers back in the branch for 'financial well being checkup' i.e. come in so we can sell you stuff. Turnover is big issue. All branches are constantly under-staffed but no let up on sales goals.","Branch Sales and Service Rep","Current Employee","Frederick, MD","July 12, 2018","3.0"
2338,"Solid company but not much growth opportunity in comunity development","The CDB team is pretty flat with no room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.

2343,"It's alright","Management differs heavily between branches. There are a handful of managers who are willing to work with individuals to seek advancement. Most however, either dislike interviewing or are too comfortable with their over inflated bonuses to be willing to risk helping you get promoted and in the process loosing some of that incentive with the new hire. The claim they pride themselves on promoting from within but as with most banks you will quickly find that they outside hire often. The only normal internal promotions are within branches when there is again zero risk to the branch manager and their bonus. Employee culture is excellent, work life balance is very good and the compensation is fair. The retirement benefits are the most generous portion of the package. That being said until the internal talent development culture sees a massive shift this bank is at best a great stepping stone on the way to where you want to be. That is unless you are an outside hire.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Indianapolis, IN","July 11, 2018","3.0"

2348,"Great place to work. Hard to get paid enough to want to continue.","I worked at this bank for four years learning all I could to advance. But it seemed on some fronts that it was hard to get ahead unless you knew someone in the ranks. Sometimes the work is hard when you are dealing with rude clients. I've had days where clients made me furious and used their entitlement to look down on what I did there. But there were a lot of great times too. There are some clients who make what you do worth while. However, considering all that is required to do the job safely the pay isn't worth it. Especially if you are working as a teller. I did the BSSR position and MORE for two years with no pay increase and very little hope of advancement considering the efforts I went through to help bring my branch to greater heights.","BSSR","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 9, 2018","4.0"
2349,"Company is great, RM not so much","Overall, the company is a good company to work for. However, the regional manager has made it very hard to want to come to work anymore! We've lost a lot of great employees in our region due to the regional manager. Of course, anywhere you go, not every manager is going to be a great one, but this one is the WORST RM I have ever worked for! Far worse than when I worked for Wells Fargo. If you want to work for this bank, I would recommend doing it outside of the Fayetteville, NC region!","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Current Employee","Fayetteville, NC","July 9, 2018","3.0"
