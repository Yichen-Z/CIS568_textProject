Boy, the management sure does know how to get the newbies hyped up for foolishness. The last day of training, people started to leave. this bank is a stressful place to work indeed. From the time you log in to CATCH and turn on Spirit, the calls will be back-to-back with calls regarding disputes, transactions, etc. This bank has some terrible fees was well. There's a saying in the company regarding 'Overdraft Tuesdays' when customers would notice a positive balance in their accounts from Friday thru Monday, then Tuesday the funds are gone. The customer is under the impression that their balance wasn't negative over the weekend. This is just one of many issues that this bank needs to update and fix. Too many bogus expectations there as well. You can have a whole week of good calls, but the audit team will find your worst call and grade you on that, so they won't give you your deserved bonus. The team leads have their teams working like busy-bees so that their 'manager's' numbers can look good. One thing that I did like was the small cafe and the self-service store in the building. Besides that, it was ratchet.","Support Representative","Former Employee","Whitehall, OH","February 6, 2019","1.0"
