At first I absolutely loved my position, helping the branch and fellow team with audits, trading the tellers to learn and grow and helping our customers Somewhere along the way in the last year or so heavy product pushing, sales, sales , sales and all about numbers took over. The teller leads are doing the job of a manager but getting paid like a teller and if all your tellers are not performing then you are not either. It became tougher and tougher and the hours and time that you put in, along with the 100 things you have to maintain and balance are not worth it!","Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Pennsylvania","March 21, 2017","2.0"

3929,"Do not waste your time working in this bank Customer Service Dept.","Rushed training, management is cutthroat. If your really good on the phones in the first day of training outside of the classroom they keep you, otherwise forget ever moving into the role of Customer Service Representative. The Customer Service Management claim they are experts in whether your going to be bad or good on the phones the first day and if you are slow learning the 15-20 screens you need to know, they cut you immediately. Also you can't get the vacations you asked for because your last in line so new training classes are not going to get requested time off. They also ask you to open a new bank account one week into classroom trading, don't do it. If they cut you, close the account immediately. Also there is no accountability at the whole company as there is no complaint resolution, except for a call center. If you have a problem with management or they treat you unfairly expect more of the same as upper management rubber stamps lower management decisions.
