3609,"Loss mitigation","This company could be awesome, but the experience is taken away by manegerial flaws to the 25th power. Any company you work based on culture starts at the top. this bank loss mitigation department heads have no real relationships with what is going on with staff and barely supervisors. Upper managemt in any way shape or form does not help to streamline a process, but add more and more to a lengthy overdrawn process as well. They believe in a do as i say not as i do sort of management style. They are exempt we are not kind of attitude creating an us against them mentality. This is not good management and it starts from the top. Seldom do you hear any good news from the loss mit dept. They also do layoffs each year. They tell you there are no layoffs. Then turn right around and do it. They also you personal agenda's to pick who goes.

3630,"Good company...low pay","The environment was great. The people are great. The only con I have with this bank is the compensation is on the low end for finance. There are bonus opportunities, but until you hit the upper levels of management the compensation is lacking. You do work in a 9-5 environment and that is a big plus. The part of this role that was the most irritating was the outbound calling of your customers. Having to dial 15 customers per day to 'invite' (solicit) them to come in for a financial checkup was never fun. I felt like a telemarketer at times.","Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Ashland, KY","June 7, 2017","4.0"

3641,"Not for the faint of heart"," this bank tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all. Even in emergency situations. The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day. For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again. Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally.","Financial Consultant","Former Employee","Oshtemo, MI","June 5, 2017","3.0"
