6203,"Loan Officers Not Respected"," this bank has a great reputation for Financial Services and Banking, mortgages, not so much. In Southern California, they are known for causing problems for Short Sellers and their realtors, by holding out for more money in a 2nd lien position, and settling with regulators for large amounts of money for mortgage related infractions. But this is all stuff that you're able to overcome with strong relationships. What you can't overcome is upper management's refusal to hire more fulfillment staff. LO's make too much money anyway, right? They can also process their own loans. Recently they unveiled a new fulfillment process that would set everything strait. Basically it amounted to the LO submitting a loan package that had everything short of transcripts. It is a 90+ point check list of documents needed to get your file to underwriting. The files went straight to UW, the processors didn't get involved until later. I still don't quite understand what the few processors they do have actually do. They didn't pull together outstanding paperwork, collect info to satisfy conditions, or anything you would expect a processor to do. That being said, there were a few goods ones I enjoyed working with except it was rare that they would be assigned to my files, the good processors were assigned to the LOs who submitted incomplete files..... The corporate side of the company is horrible. The culture you find when dealing with HR, Payroll, etc. is a finger pointing, 'That's not my job', can't do attitude. Management in general has an extremely arrogant attitude, they truly believe - more...","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Pasadena, Ca","October 22, 2013","1.0"

I have found that everyday is a learning experience at my job, for one we have courses that we take, and just customer interaction, you never know what a customer needs, would like you to do, or find out for them. I enjoy my co-workers we work as a family instead of a team, we help one another, we can also make the day go by fast just for the little things that we do to encourage the other person. The hardest thing about my job I think is when you work for a big branch, you lose some of the personal connection with your customers, and sometimes that is difficult, most customers want that personal one on one, and in my position as a teller you have to look at everything and sometimes not that you want that but it gets lost because you are trying to help and get your customers in and out in a reasonable time. The most enjoyable is when my customer have a problem and you have helped them and the look on their faces have that relieve smile, and you hear thank you, to me helping my customers is so important, and making sure that their needs are met me a lot.","Teller","Current Employee","Township of Cranberry, PA","October 12, 2013","4.0"
