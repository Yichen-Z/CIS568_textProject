2954,"Leadership lacking and advancement opportunity","Don't really know where to start but the company was bank N bank which was later brought out by this bank, they decided to change the culture and make it like Chase Bank . Following the merger completion, the culture completely changed and everything went down the tube. Would have loved to stay but they also got rid of all the good managers and leaders , demanding more but unwilling to to reflect it with the pay.

2956,"Too high of expecations","Started off a great place to work, after a short period of time you are expected to know or how to figure out everything on your own with no guidance which makes it extremely stressful. Managers get high bonuses when everyone hits there goals but the workers get very little bonus. Due to the managers getting a higher bonus they expect everyone to reach goal and if you don't your are heavily punished","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Bath, PA","January 2, 2018","2.0"
2957,"Stressful, fast paced environment","This was a fast-paced job required to sell checking/savings accounts and also performing teller functions. I learned to put myself out there and sell to people. Management was highly concerned with selling and not so much the customer. Hardest part of the job was having to sell a product to people who were grocery shopping. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and benefits.","TELLER","Former Employee","Mechanicsburg, PA","January 1, 2018","3.0"
2958,"Great Benefits, Poor Coworkers","The training is as minimal as it gets. You're thrown to the sharks and coworkers are petty, rude, and disrespectful. It's insane how many people laugh at coworkers and customers behind their backs. Benefits are amazing - 10 weeks full paid maternity leave with 6 weeks full paid parental leave, and 3 weeks vacation. Awesome health insurance. Bonuses are very reasonable. Literally if it weren't for the disrespectful atmosphere and utter lack of competent training, this bank would be a great place to work.","Teller Supervisor","Current Employee","Florida","January 1, 2018","3.0"

2960,"Very stressful place to work"," this bank was an extremely stressful place to work with little to no understanding from the management team. Front line workers answering customer calls, inquiries, and complaints were repremanded when not fully satisfying and making the customer happy, even when it was something out of their control. Scores for customer surveys were taken very seriously, even on the occasion that it was clear that they representative was calm, attentive, and helpful to the best of their abilities, but the customer was still dissatisfied that their requests were not completed the way they wanted and a low score was given.","Credit Card Services Senior Consultant","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 1, 2018","2.0"
2961,"Fast paced, very stressful","Current management very good. Past management-very much micro managed. Culture is very competitive-pitting co-workers against each other. Even though we as workers try to work as a team - in order to reach goals there are many times you must work as cut throat. This makes for very stressful environment. Once you've worked here for a length of time and reach the middle of the pay band scale it is very difficult to receive decent raises- 2% is considered a good raise. The longer I work here the further I fall behind in just covering the cost of living.","Consumer Loan Fulfillment","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 1, 2018","3.0"

2967,"It's an OK place to work","I'm very neutral about this bank as a place to work. As with all companies it depends on the area you work in. The call center often gives the wrong information when you call to seek advice which often is at odds with advice from management. Information does not always filter down to you so you find out the hard way, that you made a mistake and are held accountable. Senior management are too busy sitting in their ivory towers, making decisions which impact branch staff, without consulting the staff. They also have no idea about what is going on at branch level as they rarely, if at all, visit the branches. The job culture is extremely conservative & makes it hard to properly assist customers.","Service Associate","Personal Banker","Columbus, OH","December 30, 2017","3.0"
