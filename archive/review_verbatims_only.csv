Great place to work for most.
"I have really enjoyed working here, the only issue is in career advancement."
"There are some traditional routes that work for some, but anything outside the norm is extremely difficult no matter what level of performance or participation you have."
It's a job.
"You go in five days a week do what you need to then leave, the employees are jerks, and the manager does nothing to keep the employees from being one."
If the employees were more respectful it would be a decent place to work.
Stressful.
Banking as a whole has become an awful industry to work in.
Large corporations still using old school tactics to bring in sales.
Corporate yuppies don't understand that pounding pavement to attract sales is not an effective sales method.
"Furthermore, the manager is tied up in meetings all day that get in the way of managing, which leaves little time to get anything done."
Micromanaged and very little room for growth.
"I worked for this bank for about 10 years and every stop was a non existent budget for raises, positions that continue to expand with compensation to match."
Find a better company if growth and development are your thing.
Stressful environment .
Core service consultant.
This place is essentially a phone factory where management offers little assistance and expects associates to take back to back phone calls all day.
Productive .
It is a good place to work with management who cares to see you succeed.
Some banks micro manage but this one doesn't.
this one also really cares about your benefits
Every year they cut your pay.
Every year they expect you to work 20% harder for 20% less.
There is no future of growth for you as an MLO.
"Management makes poor decisions, but you as the employee shoulder the burden for Management."
"Management don't hire the staff when the market is hot, and Management then overcompensate by hiring too much, and don't see the market changing."
"Currently, Management's idea of fixing the market downturn is for you to call dead end phone numbers of existing customers in Management's data base."
Then the Master Plan is to automate MLOs out of MLOs's jobs as much as possible to assure future cuts in MLO pay.
I learned a lot on the job the job was a good experience..  
Working the evening shift was a plus for me at the time I worked in their corporate office working on various bank documents.
"This helped me learn more about how the banking business worked, more about how checks and other items were recorded and verified."
I learned how the bank process is handled.
I had no problem with My manager or supervisor.
The workplace was culture.
the job was easy nothing was hard about the job.
Working as a team player and keeping busy.
I have a lot to say about this company but it's pointless ….
poor management and your work like balance is never going to be 'a balance '
but I'm just one person but this company isn't all bad /amazing benefit are good .
Worst place to work.
No work life balance.
Outdated systems.
Extreme Micromanaging.
this bank watch you by cameras and then open investigations based on assumptions.
You don't have control over your branch and no ability to waive fees for good clients!
If you need to step out of the branch and have worked over 40 hours this bank still make you use your occasional absence!
The Regional Manager could not even understand that goes against Florida Law!
this bank wants you to just be a micromanaging robot!
Clients are just another person and this bank say this bank are about relationship building but this bank's actions do not show it!
I received a job offer for 20k more with a much better Financial Institution that truly values a much better Financial Institution that truly values their employees and clients's employees and clients!
"It'll do, but it kind of sucks."
When I started at this bank I was really excited and energized.
I had heard a lot about the opportunities this bank offers.
"That part is true, this bank have a lot of different departments you can train in and growth opportunities."
The downside is you do have to stay an entire year in your current position before you can apply for a different one.
So if you hate the area you're working in you better be able to suck it up for 12 months.
this bank do this bank's best to have life/work balance and are big on employees quality of life.
"However, if you work in a physical branch, you will not be trained."
I moved from the care center to the branch and was put in an office for 4 months to train myself.
I made countless mistakes every single day due to lack of resources and training.
this bank use outdated software that is extremely hard to navigate and crashes constantly.
"I got fired for something small, it was my fault, but a writeup may have been a good first step as I had never had a red mark."
The people I worked with were great but you could tell how much The people I worked with hated The people I worked with's jobs.
The end of my career with this bank I was extremely burned out and stressed.
"If you want to be overworked and work 6 days a week twice a month, this bank would be for you."
"Productive, inclusive but lacks work life balance."
Everyone does their share here although some managers believe in micromanaging.
You only have to stay in each position for a year and you can move around and apply for a new position as much as you would like.
"My only 2 complaints are with the pay; while they increased the base pay for all positions, positions like tellers supervisors and people who are both bankers and tellers have sales requirements but receive no sales pay."
Also the hours are getting worse it makes work life balance hard for those who have small children.
"Maternity, 401k, stock options, and tuition reimbursement along with other benefits are great."
It was okay. .
Okay place to work at.
Seems like all they cared about was sales.
It paid the bills.
Work life balance was okay.
Not a job I was completely thrilled about.
Don't work here.
I have been with the company for 6 months and been without a manager for 5 months.
I have to learn the banks systems by myself with no help from upper management.
Don't waste your time with the company.
Micromanage and demeaning .
Worked here for 3 months as a Sales Rep because 3 months's all I could take.
Managers micromanage you.
You can't even go to the bathroom.
"If you do, Managers'll ask where you were for so long (3-10 mins)."
"I remember during training, someone asked are we allowed to take a break to go to the bathroom."
One supervisor said do it on your scheduled break time.
Taking calls back to back with people screaming at you and they don't let you take a break to decompress from it.
"This place is horrible for your mental, physical and emotional health"
Good job. .
Good place to work.
Great benefits.
Flexible schedules.
Great managers.
Could offer more opportunities to advance within lines of business.
But overall a good place to work.
They 'customer service' their own employees.
The pay is nice however the stress is almost not worth it.
Half the time you don't even know who your manager is.
They are getting so big that they can't properly service their employees and you just get pushed around.
I've heard that they will escalate issues too many times and nothing is ever done.
You are just an underpaid Robot.
"They expect the world, with repetitive, duplicate documentation using sub standard computer systems that are always crashing."
No work/life balance unless you are Management.
They feel that they can command your life 24/7.
"Schedules set, but that is all fake since once you plan on the schedule set for you, they change the schedule set for you at a moment's notice despite anything you may have planned."
"If you refuse to 'fill in', they lump you as a non-team player."
Management commits you to work areas and times Management have not asked you ahead of time.
"Lunches are always interrupted, so if you want to have the time you are allowed, you have to actually leave the premises and turn off your phone."
"Company seems great, but my branch wasn't. ."
I had high hopes with Company.
Poor management within my branch contributed to a terrible work environment.
Too much gossip about new people.
Managers lie because Managers don't know the answer.
Stressful place to work .
Over worked and undervalued .
You are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated at all.
Management is terribly and there is always miscommunication between managers.
Such a stressful job.
Pay is good .
It a ok company to work for but they are not organized I wish it stayed bank B because once it become this bank they changed a lot but the pay is better I will say the pay's the only thing that's better than bank B
No Comment .
Typical Banking profit over people mentality.
Better you do the more overwhelmed other areas are and then leads to great worker morale.
On top of that the better one does the more incentive one makes but less they have to dole out for next quarterly making it harder to make said goals.
The bank of the past.  
this bank tries so hard to be a bank of the future but has terrible systems in place filled with service issues.
"Multiple locations have gone cashless yet atm always have service issues, new system still has a lot of bugs to work out and staffing is always a problem due to a high turnover rate."
this bank expect you to drive sales but do not properly train you or give you proper product knowledge.
The variety in products/ services is not competitive enough with the market and customer service department is even long wait times for the internal lines.
The check in process for clients is completely awful and most customers complain about The check in process for clients yet
The check in process for clients is enforced tremendously.
Management gets to do whatever Management want and regional manager doesn't really care about what's actually going on in the branches.
this bank is a great place to work if you like to be swamped with clients and have a bunch of meaningless tasks to complete you barely have time to do.
"Got me through Covid, But still not satisfactory ."
"I'm grateful to this bank for getting me and my family through Covid, and the benefits ( HSA, PARENTAL LEAVE, VACATION ) are nice, but ultimately due to some poor changes in incentives, branch hours, staffing and pay, i wouldn't call this bank a great company to work for."
"Good Start to banking career, burned out quickly ."
Great place to learn and start your bank career.
Lots of support from team members if you needed Lots of support from team members if you needed it.
Downside was politics and playing favorites which I feel is most bank culture at the branch level..
Downside was politics and playing favorites which I feel is most bank culture at the branch level.
Really depends on management and there willingness to mentor you
Branch Manager .
"1) Overworked, expected to work 6 days a week, work life balance is a joke in retail banking."
2) Sales quota doesn't reflect branch location and traffic.
"this bank approval criteria for lending services is extremely rigid, this bank approval criteria for lending services doesn't work in a low to meditate income area."
In addition managers have to drive small business in addition to other duties.
3) operations is outdated!
Complete waste of productivity.
"Productive, great learning experience, enjoyable job."
I really enjoyed my time with this bank Financial Institution.
I had an outstanding manager that I learned a lot from!
"A great place to work, with great compensation and benefits!"
Poor management .
Regional manger hires Regional manger's friends from previous competitors and makes his friends managers.
"his friends are lazy, incompetent and arrogant."
"Turnover is high, training is horrible"
Overall a good company.
This company has plenty of opportunities for advancement.
It's just getting past the managers that have a chip on the managers that have a chip on their shoulders's shoulders.
The micromanaging and the attitudes were overwhelming.
"Great company, poor senior managers.  "
this bank (mortgage) is an all right company to work for.
"I love that this bank (mortgage) promote working remotely, and so far all of my direct managers have been great!"
"However, my senior managers have not been."
"my senior managers only care about reports and numbers, and not the actual employee."
If you're blessed to work here & have a great frontline a manger then you'll be fine.
"Oh yea, getting hired on is like you're working for the FBI."
The hiring process is strenuous and doesn't even align with the job and environment of this bank (mortgage).
The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the change in policy and procedures it can get to be a little tricky.
The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the change in policy and procedures it can get to be a little tricky.
When there is an issue with the employee especially one that has given years of service to this bank the employee should have More of a voice than what the employee have when it come to Disciplinary action
Good place to work .
"If you can self manage while working from home, you can be very successful."
"However, if you can't, then you will fail rather quickly."
"Management is great, except for one person, however minimal interaction with one person makes Management very satisfying."
Great way to start but limited room for growth.
I found my time within the Investor Reporting Department to be full of learning opportunities and really appreciated my coworkers and management in my coworkers and management's enthusiastic willingness to teach me as I worked.
I would highly recommend you start your career with this bank.
Great place to work if you are hard working.
I have been at this bank for only 2 months
but I can confidently tell you this bank's a great place to work.
"this bank actively look to promote from within, as well as this bank are incredibly supportive."
this bank is FAST PACED LEARNING so be prepared for that.
"If you get overwhelmed, tell your mentors, your mentors are incredible and want you to succeed."
"I happen to work very late hours and I didn't feel that was significantly expressed to me when I accepted the job, but the pay and benefits outweigh the unfortunate working hours."
Really cool.
I liked working here it was fun and got good experience and got paid well enough for the hours and got some really great experience and it was fun lol
"Micromanaging, no work life balance."
Branch manager role.
Micromanagement to the core.
Report after report of things you aren't doing correctly.
Audits are conducted through the cameras.
Absolutely no cell phone tolerance.
Branch managers are business bankers- cold calls to prospect businesses and held accountable for achieving business goals alone (no bankers open business accounts) and held accountable for achieving consumer side as well.
"Incentive pay out only happens when 50% of your bankers achieve 50% of your bankers's goals, not if the branch is 100% or above or if you achieve the business goal that you are held personally accountable for."
under-staffed and no applicants.
Expected to conduct weekly meetings with every employee to touch base every employee's goals - with no staff.
"Depending on branch size, bankers expected to call 800+ calls to consumers and branch managers expected to conduct consumer and business calls to be at target."
this bank is in the middle of switching programs to make it 'easier' - it's not.
"Expected to have 5 star customer service, write monthly action plans, and call surveys conducted on the branch for feedback and now additional calls to bad surveys to be invited back to be surveyed again."
"Phones must be answered on 3rd ring, even in front of clients at your station, expected to deliver offers to the client in the same interaction while delivering exceptional customer service, within a 'timely' (2 minute) manner."
Corporate drives through your branches drive thru's and times their wait time while surprise visiting your branch.
"Anyway, good benefits."
"Great coworkers, fair pay."
"As long as you have a good manager, this is a great place to work."
Everyone is super helpful and fun to work with.
We do have goals to meet each month which gives me a challenge but I enjoy that.
Great company but horrible upper management.
great company to work for but everyone is competing against each other....sometimes management told you one thing and then damned if you do and don't.
its a country club place...
mickey mouse house club.
Great Work Culture .
I love work at this bank this bank hold strong core value and actually follow this bank.
this bank are big on employee development and a innovative company.
this bank take customer and employee feedback and in corporate customer and employee feedback into there procedure.
The pay is great as well.
I love this bank
Terrible.
Horrible place to work.
Awful management and even more awful culture.
Truly a miserable experience.
Just enough pay to make other places less appealing not enough pay to make for a decent life.
All around demoralizing and inhumane work environment.
Poor Retail Lending leadership has led to a mass exodus of top talent.
No signs of improvement. .
Since the current leadership in the Retail Lending business has taken over the business environment has suffered greatly.
"The majority of the experienced product management talent have all left over the last year as a result of poor leadership and recent leadership decisions have made thing worse, especially in the card business."
If you're considering a role in retail/card proceed with caution.
"Average pay, a difficult management team and low morale make retail/card a challenging place to work."
Do not take FA job at the branch.
Bankers and tellers are forced to provide you with so call referrals.
"99% are bad, so 99% can get management off 99%'s backs."
The book you are given has been picked by all the old time advisors and you are left with the lower level clients.
Compensation is also poor if you can not meet your goals.
Management is super toxic.
"No confidentiality, hard to get vacation requested. ."
Sales pressure.
Goals are unrealistic.
Pressured to sale credit cards is insane.
Constantly driving to Milwaukee for meetings that could be done virtually.
Can't sit down.
You get to work 8 + hours on your feet.
Not a good place to work.
Goals are way to high and pay is very low compared to other banks. .  
Not a good place to work.
Goals are way to high and pay is very low compared to other banks.
However the benefits are somewhat good.
But management looks everything that you do and criticizes your work.
I would not consider this place if you are thinking about going into the banking industry.
Lots of contact with home office in PA and everyone was super to work with!.
Loved working here and would still be there if they had not moved their offices back to Pittsburgh.
Now they have come back to Texas!!!
Management was terrific.
What we was needed to do the job was provided.
Good company.
If you do your part they will definitely take care of you.
They do offer a lot of advancement if you put enough effort into you job.
Was very happy while employed with them
Great Company because of Trainers & Management.
"The Trainers, and the training scheduled classes were really informative and live real day to day experiences."
The only thing is when you were asked to get work done(overtime) and were not paid for work.
"Used to be decent, now a total nightmare ."
"Managers do not care about you, Managers treat you as a number."
Compensation for goals were taken away yet you are still demanded to meet goals.
"Corporate is a joke, Corporate could care less about the little people."
Expect to leave late and work every weekend since Corporate barely hire people.
Good job if you want to put a paycheck before your mental and physical health.
Retail Lending business environment continues to suffer under current leadership team (Especially in Card) .
Over the past 3-4 years the work environment in this bank's's retail lending world has suffered greatly due to this bank's ineffective leadership team.
"As a result the work environment in this bank's retail lending world has become toxic, especially in Card for both the product team and business partners."
"Lack of leadership experience, poor strategic vision and the careless approach to managing employee relations and growth has lead to a mass exodus of much of the top talent."
As a result of it's ineffective leadership team it is nearly impossible to accomplish the goals that are set and it has begun to negatively impact business in a major way.
"Under current leadership, especially in Card, not a great environment to work in."
"Descent job, work hard to meet goal."
It's was a great company to work.
You really have to perform in order to be considered for a promotion.
There is a lot of training courses you can take to develop skills
Over the last few years this bank has gone political.
"When I joined this bank this bank was a rock solid company, not sure what happened but every year this bank have lost focus."
this bank do not promote internal employees and if promoted internally you do not get a raise for up to two years after the promotion.
I enjoyed assisting customers and my colleagues but The pay is horrible and hours are long..
"A great place to help customers, stable job security."
"You will enjoy 3 weeks of vacation and paid federal holidays, The pay is horrible and you can expect to work 6 days a week."
You.
Can look forward to working 9 hours day with a 30 minute lunch if you want a day off during the week.
The Goals are not realistic.
If you are lucky enough to meet your goals your compensation not worth all the hard work.
Please review your paystub and make sure you receive the base pay negotiated because there's no work like balance in this position.
Productive and fun place to work .
Very dynamic working place.
One of the best place to work.
Advancement opportunities there if you want.
Co-workers are very co-operative.
Overall a good bank to work.
Best Company I ever worked for!.
Best company I have ever worked for!
We even have career counseling to help you decide what direction to go and moving up is extremely easy if that is your goal.
Great managers.
I appreciate the team I worked with.
Everyone within the organization that I had the pleasure to work with were helpful.
the organization had great managers who genuinely wanted you to succeed.
I worked on the southside location Bronzeville.
I guess I got lucky my location my branch manager was the best my branch manager was really cool and good to work with our regional or district manager was a guy and our regional or district manager was pretty laid-back they definitely expect you to do your job and expect 100% from you
but what job doesn't the southside location Bronzeville was a really good work environment never had any complaints I got lucky
Micromanagement.
Management is not supportive and leans toward micromanaging.
The environment is not supportive and I don't feel as if I have learned all that I can.
Branch operations is not the way to go.
Not bad....
I worked at a downtown location so I had weekends off.
This was nice and gave me a sense of work life balance.
My branch manage and My branch manage's boss seemed to care more about delegating work than doing any My branch manage and his boss...
The assistant branch manager is what made working there worth it.
this bank Leadership is Male Dominated.
"If you are a woman working at this bank, you'll have less opportunity than your male peers in many groups."
Leadership often took credit for subordinate's work.
"Leadership watched the clock and if you needed to leave 'early', even if you had worked 9-10 hours, it was frowned upon."
Productive and inclusive.
"Great coworkers, management is struggling but getting better every day."
Training has been an issue but management is really trying to make Training better since some senior people have been moving to other teams.
Experience .
Working at this bank is a great experience but management is poor.
My Colleagues are very helpful.
"Training no s excellent, pressure to achieve your goals are consistent."
Pretty good salary and benefits .
Salary is higher than most customer service jobs.
Benefits are good however they cannot pay me enough to deal with such rude people.
The trainings could have been so much better but i feel as though we were rushed through everything to get us on the phones.
There's a huge lack of communication amongst the mentors.
Some say to do a job one way then others will tell you something else.
You are very micromanaged
Disappointed .  
this bank wants you to believe that this bank truly value you as an employee...
Management could use a dose of reality checks your general well-being is never considered.
"When I first started working for this bank bank tellers were given incentives for teller referrals, this bank took incentives for teller referrals away and didn't compensate appropriately."
I'm very disappointed with this bank I loved my job in the beginning and at the end I was drained and extremely unhappy.
Great Starter Job .
the company's a great company to work for if you are going to school for something else or if you want to get your foot in the door with the banking world.
You can move up easily but only if you are wanting to stay in the retail banking (customer facing and customer service) roles.
The corporate or back office roles might require a different entrance into the company.
"Otherwise, go for it!"
All work no fun and hardly any breaks..
Lacks inclusion.
Employees are expected to work 7 hour shifts with only 30 minutes break.
Employees don't care about Employees's employees.
We are treated like machines.
No set schedule either.
My schedule changes every week so you can't make plans.
Overall I will not recommend this Bank as this Bank's treats this Bank employees unfairly.
Really exciting and interesting work environment where you learn a lot.
Everyone there is so kind and willing to help.
This was my first internship experience and everyone is so welcoming and willing to help.
I would highly recommend.
"You can move up within the company, management and support is horrible."
"The call volume is really high, management is horrible, the call flow is so high that you can't take a breather, and when you try to reach out to support it was hard, no one wanted to take the call."
I had to leave.
No Work life balance and horrible pay.
Does not pay well at all.
Long work hours post pandemic.
Incompetent managers.
Very cheap company.
The pay does not match the work demanded.
Benefits are nice but that's it.
Good pay.
The expectations are very high.
It is a stressful environment.
Customers can be very brutal.
Customers expect a lot from you immediately.
"If you have tough skin, you could work here."
I personally just am too sensitive.
Great Culture.
Good Company with great benefits.
"They offer competitive healthcare, and both 401K & Pension."
"However they are little conservative on the base pay scale, as competitors offer more."
"Because their base pay is low, their incentive program is really great, as top producers can earn a lot."
The drawback to that is that you loose a lot of new employees to competitors because it usually take a while to get your self establish and start performing at a high level to get the big incentives.
An Alright Job.
The only benefit that I should say that this company has is that the benefits are pretty decent.
The pay could be better.
Management is ridiculous and feel like you get no help from anyone.
"All about sales and numbers, not about employees."
Working remotely was very convenient with decent pay .
Customer support training was minimal.
Worked with customers and didn't feel like I had learned enough basic information.
Management support and management that focused on job performance we're separate and this was frustrating.
Training is clearly non-existent overall.
"Starting out, mine thought it may be a decent place."
mine quickly learned that there is zero training overall in all departments.
"You call for assistance for things, get 4 different answers, no consistency at all within the company."
"Sick time is plentiful but when mine had employees that called in for a week at a time, there was nothing mine could really do aside from also do employees that called in for a week at a time's job on top of mine, so mine had to work from home most days."
"No breaks at all, could hardly use the restroom."
Work here if you want to work yourself to death.
Great Benefits but so much cold calling.
I really enjoy working for my branch!
My coworkers and I respect one another.
I enjoy working with our customers even with the occasional rude client here and there.
"However, they push cold calls a lot and some of the sales goals just don't seem attainable."
They offer great benefits and I do feel like I am paid adequately.
Overall pretty stable job.
Too much waterfall like project and not following agile methodology.
Also career advanced seems difficult.
"Based on the market, recently they have made a change to increase salary of workers a lot more than the past and hope they can keep this up"
Employee at this bank.
Unless you were a favorite in that branch or if you have kids you are treated differently people who have kids are allowed to call in whenever people who have kids want to or leave whenever people who have kids want to.
Also some people are allowed to break policy over others again if your favorite you get away with it
Supportive work place with growth opportunities and amazing work life balance .
Always feel appreciated in my work.
However the pay does not fairly reflect job responsibility and requirements.
Great vacation and PTO incentives.
"Benefits could be better, but Benefits seem to be competitive across corporations."
A lot depends on your own mental attitude.
"Day in the Life, taking calls from regular consumers about ckg and savings, debit cards, overdrafts."
"Online banking calls: unlock, explain to people what a browser is or how to close a window."
"Time goes fast, calls are varied."
"Worst part is daily reports about how you take too long by so-many-seconds on average, per call."
You just have to enjoy helping people and realize you're doing just fine.
Sometimes that's harder than others.
"I used to love this job, but things have gotten tough.."
I started at this bank a few years ago and moved up pretty quickly after snagging a few promotions.
"I used to love this job, but find it getting harder everyday to get up and do my best."
"I feel like since the merger in 2021, this bank've been on a very difficult path to recovery and not much is being done to help the front line staff answering customer questions and complaints."
this bank went from being busy (1-2 minute call wait times) to exceptionally busy (customers are waiting 30 minutes to an hour before an agent is able to help).
"Since the turn of the year, this has not been getting better."
this bank has tried to help some of these people by raising the minimum wage company-wide.
"While that did help some newer people, a lot of this bank got stuck with little to nothing in terms of a rate increase."
While it MAY get back to normal in the next few months it has been pretty terrible from October 2021 to the current date.
I am getting very demotivated and am seeking other opportunities outside this bank.
Other jobs are out there that pay more for this type of work.
Good place to work..
Great place to learn new things.
Supportive in learning new technologies.
Lots of free online training.
Good payUnrealistic goals sometimes.
Management wants to be agile but still hard dates for deliveries.
Overall its aged company though.
Productive and exciting workplace .
This job has been a great position during the pandemic to work at and I had a good time with my staff and managers.
I support anyone that wants to work here
"Fast-paced, poor work/life balance but good people."
Days are fast paced with too much time fixing problems resulting from poor leadership communication.
Co-workers are wonderful but can only maintain positivity so long.
"Good place to work, bad pay."
They need better training and pay.
They seem to pay less the more I worked there.
Their transition from bank B was not easy and I feel like they could have communicated better to employees but especially the clients.
Good Life/work Balance .  
this bank is a good company to work for.
this bank care about life/work balance and allow flexible start times.
Employee Engagement is also important to this bank.
Great job especially after the new raise for tellers! .
Great place to get your foot in the door especially after graduating highschool.
It offers all the office type work experience needed to excel in any other type of office job setting with good pay for all entry level positions.
Good Company Culture.
"Lots of room for growth, however internal candidates are only given the opportunity for 10% raises."
The compensation leaves much to be desired: I've actually heard a number of people I'm different lines of business leave the organization for better pay and then return to this bank using a number of people I'm different lines of business's current salary with the other organization as leverage.
Do not recommend .
"Training is not clear, once on the floor, what was said in training is now completely different from what you'll actually be doing."
QA also rigid- dinged for items that you were told were the correct way/steps when in training.
Nice place to work.
It is a very good place to work to start up and have a start up career.
Also a good college student job because of pay and hours.
Customers can be iffy
Decent place to work but lower on salaries.  
this bank is an all right place to work.
this bank heavily focus on technology.
Some managers were terrible and straight up rude to employees.
Compensation is okay.
Productive and fun place to work.
Compensation is lacking..  
this bank is a great place to work in terms of workload.
Not so much at first but getting better now.
Coworkers are great but the work can get a bit boring and repetitive.
Great benefits but....
They need better training and pay.
They seem to pay less the more I worked there.
Their transition from bank B was not easy and I feel like they could have communicated better to employees but especially the clients.
Good pay redundant paperwork.
The pay is good.
It is hard to get some days off due to the only one person out of the branch policy.
A lot of having to input the same info into different systems to receive proper credit.
A lot is expected from you in a day but there never seems to be enough time to get it done.
The this bank Board needs to reexamine the Leadership!.  
this bank has turned management into a team of babysitters that only recognize what the team is doing wrong.
Never a 'good job' or 'great progress' and more importantly 'THANK YOU'.
Leaders address those who are not performing individually.
I am sick of hearing how the team failed when I meet all of my goals!
"The majority of people are working long hours, training is practically non-existent or sporadic at best, we are told to reduce errors and take our time and the next day to pick up extra work and get extra work done faster (while constantly training due to turnover because we have no formal department training program)."
Can't you manage the company while retaining and keeping your employees semi-happy at your employees's workplace?
"Also, it is sickening to read what the Executives receive in yearly stock options/bonuses, your yearly salary is already more than my whole department combined!"
I understand the dynamics and responsibilities on your shoulders but you have turned extremely greedy while watching the staff figure out how the staff are going to feed the staff's family/or pay for parking on the staff's meager salary.
"I will obtain my degree in 2 months, I doubt my manager even remembers, and like some others, I am looking for a job that appreciates and rewards me for my work ethic and loyalty as well as my desire to assist others while independently striving to grow myself."
Audios!
Slow paced.
"Slow Paced, good if you're in one of the lending teams."
Less Devs with lot of agile people which is self explanatory as a mid level bank.
Low compensation
Could be a great environment with better management.
Abysmal management that on morning meanings would tell us 'Sometimes the best work is work we don't get paid for'.
"Horrid work/life balance, decent pay but not for the amount of stress"
Trading was stressful and triggered my anxiety.
I wouldn't recommend this job unless you have previous banking experience.
In my training class it seemed the ones with previous banking experience caught on a lot faster.
I've worked with a few work from home call centers before and Trading was the most tedious and stressful one of all.
I understand why they offer benefits and free accounts because they know this job is stressful.
It had a great training program but in the branch was very different.
Great training program that got you excited for your role.
However the real life day to day in branch was not the same.
High goals and high pressure even if not putting customer needs first
Internship Experience .
Everyone was nice and encouraging.
It is a very relaxed position and you will need to take initiative in taking more tasks.
You are on your own most of the time.
Good place to work.
You really have to take charge in wanting to advance and make sure you are open about it with management.
this bank offers the tools and resources to make this possible as well.
No complaints .
Haven't been here too long.
Just started a few months ago but no complaints so far!
Good environment and 6wk training before you are moved on to banking floor.
Not professional no work ethics .
They go by referrals for me which makes it unfair.
They teach those whom they only like so no room for advancement.
Feels like you're in a marketplace than in a workplace even managers yell across the room & being sarcastic.
even managers said even managers have the volume but management only holding management's work to show management have the volume.
Look somewhere else this is a marketplace!
Remote Loans /Customer Service.
I did not like the fact that new employees coming on got a better shift while new employees are stuck with there shift and not offered bids etc.
This company also likes to up-train for different departments and not offer pay increases.
I also noticed new employees got offered what employees whom had been with This company for a couple years were getting.
All right company to work for.
Decent place to work .
Call centers are call centers.
I just hate back to back calls.
Nonetheless the benefits were well.
I liked being able to have a free checking account.
All about departments .
"Great place if you are in the right one, it really depends on the people in your department and your department."
Work is what you make it take pride in your work.
It's descent .
They want you to do more work without the added compensation.
You'll work 2 Saturdays a month at least.
Staffing is usually an issue.
A bunch of pointless things
High paced sales organization with ever-changing methods.
Aggressive goal set for management that seems to only increase with time.
"Goals are built off prior year's accomplishments, so if you blow it out of the water, be prepared to have increased goals for years to come."
Disorganized and not taking talent seriously.
I've been at this bank for half a decade and have held more than one role at a mid-senior level.
Each year I have seen more than 40% of teams turning over and spent a significant amount of work time recruiting for open roles.
"However once this bank get people hired, often this bank don't have work for people to do or people end up with busy work that isn't challenging."
"this bank isn't a culture where business results are prioritized enough, doing work tasks and having meetings is and the result is that this bank're falling behind in offering modern customer experiences."
"I am really disappointed in my experience, I expected to learn and grow and what I found is that management doesn't take the talent management have seriously."
Fast paced but monotonous .
"My role as a teller is fast paced, the branch is very busy."
Management feels out of touch with teller needs.
The schedule changes daily and you're frequently stuck working beyond your scheduled shift time but even when you give advanced notice that you need a day off Management makes you feel like a day off's a big deal and doesn't seem to want to work with you.
Customers are super mean to new employees who are trying to follow policy for protecting customer accounts.
"The pay is higher than anywhere else in the area, and this bank do offer benefits, vacation time, sick time, etc."
"I would say this bank is a good company, there's plenty opportunities for growth, but I don't believe in my current branch that I have the tools I need to be successful and I don't want to stay long term."
Turnover rate is high for a reason.
Great benefits .
The company is great and the benefits are even better.
The hours are long and it's hard to balance work and home life.
The workload is stressful and the pay is not enough for the amount of work and stress that is put on you.
Conversion Nightmare.
"As a former bank B employee of 10+ years, I was very happy."
When bank B bought out bank B I was hesitant but excited for something new.
This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed.
The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform thousands of employees's jobs efficiently.
"I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off."
The job roles we were placed into did not align with prior roles and responsibilities.
The stress level is unreal.
Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress.
Imagine starting a new job as a banker.
You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations
"but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and procedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat."
"Not one person knows new systems, polices and procedures and it's time to open the doors on a Monday."
You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to.
That want to service accounts but you don't know how.
That truly need you to help accounts but you can't.
That is what this process is like.
"My advice, stay away until they figure out. 5 months in and there are still so many issues to resolve."
"Decent company, compliance is a joke.."
The compliance officers make it extremely hard to do your job.
"It's one thing to be thorough and another to nitpick and pass the buck, which The compliance officers like doing."
Micromanaging .
Your are just a number with this company.
this company is still getting on this company's feet after a big merge.
"However, the pressure on accomplishing sales goals is ridiculous."
You are constantly being watched and babied.
There is no peace of mind at this job.
Management is terrible.
Sourcing Loans and investments.
"Team approach, once the goals in my area were completed I was able to work with other areas and mentor train younger less experienced officers."
We all worked toward the same goals
A great WFH start.
An amazing first wfh position to get used to structure.
"Calls are back to back, no bonuses."
Amazing team leads.
Room from growth within the company and a great career coaching program
stagnant and stressful.
Very stressful.
Have to deal with horrible customers and unable to disconnect line for disrespectful customers.
Doesn't help those who have a life outside of work.
Strong focus on diversity and inclusion. .
Overall this bank is a great company to work for depending on your department or location.
this bank offer great benefits and wonderful PTO.
this bank's focus on diversity and inclusion is inspiring and refreshing.
There are many departments and areas for opportunity to branch out within this bank.
Staying away from the Retail Banking side in the Detroit Area may be a good idea.
the Detroit Area is full of unrealistic demands and no appreciation for effort or work completed even if it is/ was above and beyond.
Pay could be better.
Quick advancement.
They seem to care about your future with them and offer advancement to other departments.
Pay is not great for all the knowledge you need.
Most the advancements are lateral with no advance in pay.
Fun place to work.
when i started we didn't have a manger so new employees were trying new employees.
And then when we got a manger he didn't hold a manger accountable for a manger's actions
Terrible Onboarding/Training experience .
Minimal training provided in a group virtual setting.
The people in my group were hired for business banking and The people in my group definitely didn't seem qualified.
Most didn't pay attention and were super disrespectful to the trainer.
The people in my group couldn't grasp most of it and only 2 weeks of training The people in my group put you on the phone all but yourself before you even know how to use the systems and tell you to figure it out.
The people in my group's 'in the moment support' requires you to wait long periods of time for someone to get to you which leaves the customer on hold forever and creates a terrible customer and agent experience.
In the moment The people in my group have no time to explain what The people in my group tell you to do and you can't stop taking calls to ask.
The calls are back to back with no break to document or look around.
As soon as the client hangs another is in your ear.
Craziest experience I've ever had.
I've always been a top agent working virtually in customer service and NEVER seen anything like this.
I was left no choice but to quit.
Please protect your peace and don't put yourself through this.
nice.
all depends on coworkers coworkers can make or break the day.
small teams helped motivate staff.
team activities and challenges helped keep the day interesting
Lots of changes .
Lots of changes happening with the acquisition of bank B. Feels very messy with everything going on.
Seems like a fire drill consistently.
Will be good in 3-5 years.
this bank .
Just horrible.
It's stressful.
Management is under-appreciated.
Everyone points fingers.
No one makes any money.
I never got a raise.
Customers are mean….
this bank just wants you to push credit cards on people as old as 100 years old.
Horrible.
Positive work environment.
Good training and support team.
pay was certainly fair.
"stressful job in general, but that goes for most call centers, I would think."
management and coworkers care about you
Probably the worst banking job I've ever had.
"While I worked there, I was part of a small bank a small bank they had acquired had acquired, and a small bank they had acquired kept the same salary I had."
"Great, but when my performance review came, I was denied an increase since I had already reached the 75% percentile, and regardless of my job performance I was already earning the maximum allowed."
a small bank they had acquired's salary was not competitive at all.a small bank they had acquired also ended up closing a lot of offices in the area within a few years of the acquisition.
"Even though a small bank they had acquired always referred to the acquisition as a 'merger,' it was quite evident that the acquisition was a hostile takeover."
Trained for one job but ended up doing a different job.
This company literally set me up for failure.
"I was supposed be crossed the training on multiple jobs but was only allowed to be a teller, so I never was allowed to put the training in to use, therefore the rare times I was allowed to do my actual job, I had no hands on experience."
"This company puts great emphasis on selling products to get commissions, which caused an environment that was overly competitive and coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission would not let me train because coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission did not want me to get the commission and/or credit for the 'sale'."
"an environment that was overly competitive was hostile, especially at certain offices."
(I was a floater)
I was there for 2 years and was very unhappy for the most part.
"The teller training was great, but there was a lot of overnight travel, usually for a week at a time, but the hotels were nice"
so if you like that kind of traveling that kind of traveling's nice.
All in all it was a terrible experience and 2 years of my life that i consider wasted.
Productive job.
Inbound calls back to back.
Stayed busy throughout the day.
Managers were very helpful along with my coworkers.
Room to move up if you choose to.
Left due to the location
this bank is the worse bank I have ever worked for!!
this bank's horrible pay and management I would never ever ever return to this bank. .  
this bank is horrible worse job a huge waste of my time.
I didn't feel supported by management or upper management.
The pay was low and the moral was even lower.
Great Training and Development Programs.  
this bank's ACCEL program was a great opportunity to learn about retail banking.
Felt supported by my managers and received great training.
"However, the branches the branches themselves were often under-staffed resulting in long hours."
Horrible place to work .
Working in the credit card customer service area of this company is a joke.
Absolutely zero 'work life balance.'
Because of the pandemic we work from home.
"Any time you need a new keyboard, mouse, headset or any other equipment this company provide replaced, this company do not pay you and this company blame your internet service provider."
The team leads and group leads are also a joke.
The team leads and group leads do not help when you need assistance with anything.
"The team leads and group leads do not report that you have Covid or have been in contact with someone who has Covid, as that is The team leads and group leads's JOB."
The team leads and group leads do not follow any company policies.
The most helpful people that work for The team leads and group leads would be the HR investigating team.
Strong work/life balance culture.
"My experience as a software developer lead working here is pleasant, most of the people in the company are helpful and friendly."
It is recommended to give it a chance if you are looking for a software developer role.
"Sales, sales & sales ."
Management needs improvement.
"Company focus is sales, they use the word relationships, but it's sales and you are reminded everyday, each teller is expected to provide 3 leads per day, sometimes I only had 3 customers the entire day."
I did not like having to offer older more vulnerable senior adults products that were not good for older more vulnerable senior adults or not needed.
Cool People but stressful.
"I enjoy the people at this bank, made some lifelong relationships, but the environment is stressful a lot of the time and you often have to follow strict work schedules due to schedule adherence rules."
"Did remote work as an intern, wasn't given too much work to do so remote work was mostly chill.."
"Did remote work as an intern, wasn't given too much work to do so it was mostly chill."
I was apart of the development program where I worked on a team with other interns and we did various projects for a team that were not too difficult.
The skills learned for the job were decent but specialized to the work this bank needed done.
Great place to enhance and learn new skills.
"Typical day involves managing and resolving tickets, working on projects, communicating with customers and internal partners, attending scheduled/unscheduled meetings."
A lot of repetitive tasks as well as unusual issues to resolve daily
Standard bank .
This job was a standard bank job.
Worked as a customer service Rep in one of the branches.
one of the branches was not that busy so difficult to meet the goals they wanted.
Would not recommend .
Very stressful and high quotas expected.
They listen to all calls and you have to be perfect and they will fire you for nothing and at the drop of a hat.
Great place to work.  
this bank has great benefits and work life balance- overall a great place to start your career with growth opportunities.
Management is very easy to communicate with.
"Stressful, stressful, and stressful. .  "
"Constantly nagging managers, harassing clients to invest and opening credit cards clients don't want or need, and making cold calls to clients everyday"
Regular Bank Teller Job .
I liked working in my community but management sucked.
Advancements are solely based on favoritism and favoritism's quite blatant.
Managers are always on you about meeting goals but stand around and don't help you unless Managers absolutely have to.
Ok work environment.
"Slowly starting to implement telemarketing and these calls are just a step above cold calling for appointments,."
"If you work in a shopping center like I do, you are a teller and a telemarketing salesperson."
"In spite of the heavy teller traffic, you are judged strictly on sales goals and telemarketing numbers."
The calling pressure is so great
The calling pressure tempts people to fudge numbers and report successes that are not really there which of course allows management to justify continuing high-volume calls.
"50 per cent of the job is telemarketing, 40 per cent teller work and 10 per cent opening new accounts."
If you do not mind working until 730 at night (starting at 1030am) and don't have an issue making 150 cold calls a month telemarketing might be right for you.
"If not, stay away!!!"
Great employees .
Great employees enjoyed working with fellow peers.
The hours were long and thd business day became very stressful.
Management was minimal to none.
They do have great benefits.
It's okay .
Good pay.
The bad thing is they want the whole branch to be universal tellers which then can cause conflict when it comes to goals.
Everyone's fighting for the same customer
Decent benefits and pay.
"Decent benefits and pay, flexible schedule, high volume of work, very fast paced environment, roles and responsibilities between departments not clearly defined"
Supportive Inclusive work place with good work life balance.
"The company has pretty good paid time off/benefits 401k matching etc, and great coworkers and management."
I have worked in branches and in call centers and I felt supported by my managers in branches and in call centers.
I also feel there is room for mobility and advancement as long as your work hard and and make your intentions clear.
The only downside is the pay could be better but i think the pay is pretty standard for the industry as well.
Many opportunities for advancement.
Great place to work with many opportunities for advancement within the organization.
The company seems committed to diversity and inclusion programs and community involvement.
Tellers are great.
Tellers were great to work with upper management seemed to be out of touch with reality and expectations.
Manager would throw employees under the bus so to speak over ridiculous policies.
"Productive, great work environment.."
"Great environment to work,big on TEAM WORK.Easy career advancement and training was fun."
You learn a lot everyday as long as you stay focus&productive.
"Not a bad place to work, but definitely room for improvement.."
"Not a horrible place to work, but they're driven by stats & analytics."
Not the actual person.
"I personally hated getting company performance emails that showed quarterly profits in the billions, yet there would be pay freezes or lateral moves in pay for what should have been a promotion."
this bank is a great company to work for. .
"The salary is low compared to other banks, but the work life balance is excellent."
this bank culture is top tier.
this bank culture is a positive work environment and the upper management really care about you.
N/a. Company was under-staffed.
The transfer into digital branches was a terrible idea that only angered customers and upset employees.
Lack of advancement
"Fun workplace, limited room to grow.  "
this bank is a banking service and mortgage provider.
"this bank offers this bank's borrowers perks like interest rate discounts, cashback rewards and more."
"While this bank doesn't operate in every state, this bank lets you manage your mortgage payments online."
this bank does have credit score requirements for some of this bank's loan products
not bad.
"pay needs to be more, needs more room for growth, more family time is needed, overall something different everyday and not bad to work for."
good benefits
"Burnt out, this bank just extended my branch hours. ."
While some companies are decreasing some companies's branch hours for more of a work life balance this bank decides to increase the hours.
My branch is now open a hour longer instead of 5 this bank close at 6 weekdays.
And this bank added weekend hours!
I are already burnt out with short staffing issues as well as overworked so this just makes it worse.
There is no work life balance and I dread coming into work each day.
Increased min wage.
"Management was unreliable around holidays, constant short staffing in branches (but good for the people that grew professionally and into different roles), company support at the beginning of COVID was great but decreased over time."
Good company.
"overall good company but very stressful job, done with one call and next automatically comes in no down time to notate previous calls-overall good co"
"Most exhausting, depressing job ever."
"Not sure if it was my location, or this bank as a company."
"In my experience, this was the worst job I've ever had. ."
Horrible & lazy management.
Throws NEW employees in without correct training.
"Hypocritical management, not understanding of anything."
Manager & ABM sit around doing nothing while putting entire workload on new staff & disagrees to help.
Would never recommend this bank as a company for anyone.
Mental health was not considered when talked about.
Going into work I physically felt sick everyday knowing I had to deal with the stress.
A good place for a new developer to blend in.
"If the job title is Software Dev Associate, beware that the job title's really a QA analyst role."
This company hires contractors to do the real development work.
"It's very hard/impossible to move up from the job title, forcing you to leave This company."
"Other than that, the job title's a good place to work with friendly people and good benefits."
You'll have access to support and learning materials.
Cool place to work.
Cool place to work.
Glad I had the experience and would recommend the place to anyone whose just starting in anyone whose just starting in their career path's career path.
I have nothing bad to say about working for the place
This company is very fair when it comes to compensation and performance expectations.
Management is great and empowers you to achieve your goals..
"Great job, however, you must have a great attention to detail and good confidence when it comes to speaking."
"Goals are clearly set, and you depend on yourself to get Goals done."
Good company to work for; one of the better-managed top banks; on a careful growth track.
"Management supportive, not intrusive; good, ethical and competent co-workers"
"; the culture was a 'can-do' type of attitude; relaxed, non-hierarchical structure and tone; everything is based on problem-solving."
You must care for your clients/customers.
"Stressful working in Brecksville, Operations Unit."
"Heavy workload, low pay rate. ."
It's important to know your worth.
You must be self-motivated and confident in your abilities.
Be willing to walk away from employment with this bank as soon as you realize opportunities for advancement are not as great for you as opportunities for advancement are for others.
"this bank's Brecksville unit of operations treats employees as though employees are children and not professionals, by the way, this bank micromanage employees."
A meaningful plus to employment with this bank is having an opportunity to participate in the community outreach volunteer programs when you join this bank's Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRG).
Fast Paced Environment With Supportive Staff.
Fast paced job in retail banking.
Many physical branches closed so traffic is high with people that still prefer in person banking.
"Job entailed running withdraws, deposits, and accepting payments."
Always needed to offer a financial product to customers with every transaction.
A monthly quota had to be met.
Great culture fun place to work.
I enjoyed my time at this bank.
"The people, environment and culture were all wonderful."
"However, compensation is mediocre at best and raises never exceed 2% regardless of performance."
Love working from home .
It's a good company to work for benefits are good and benefits promote work life balance.
Not happy with the hours but that's just due to me having smaller children but the work is fun and enjoyable
Excellent bank with an incredible work life balance.
I've worked for this bank since Summer of 2020 and this bank have adapted to the virtual environment with a desire to satisfy this bank's employees just as much as this bank's consumers.
"Relaxed, very good time off with pay, and most departments have a team atmosphere. ."
I just wish they paid more.
It doesn't feel like there is much incentive for being a dedicated employee.
There is not much monetary reward.
"The raises are minimal, even with great reviews from your manager."
Terrible management. .
"Maybe it was my location, but working at this bank was bad."
Manager never wanted to help or teach me new skills.
They basically throw you into the water and expect you to know everything day 1.
A great job to get your foot in the door but there is no progression!.
the job a Universal Banker for this bank was my first official job as an adult and I must say the job is a great starting point so that you can truly understand what you need from your employers in the future.
I learned so much about the importance of financial well-being and received extensive practice on how to handle all type of customer interactions which is a bonus for my future career path.
"The negatives of the job would be the compensation, the in-store branch hours provide no work/life balance and lastly, the constant changes in protocol and technology made it extremely difficult to keep up with proper procedures when it comes to helping customers."
I have always enjoyed to work in this bank.
Nice people .
"Nice people, good benefits and a lot of opportunities to learn something new."
I have always found help my colleges.
And there is a great company culture.
Not for the weak .
Calls are non stop.
Metrics are high.
"Pay and benefits are great, but the stress will make you burn out."
"Managers are nice and helpful, but there will be some situations where you will not know what to do to help the customer."
Nice company to work for.
When I was there the incentive pay was really good. .  
this bank Is a good company to work for.
this bank are very adamant about this bank employees learning the consultative conversation.
the incentive pay was good when I was there.
No no and no.
Call center is extremely busy and there is zero time to breath.
They trick you and tell you your getting promoted but with no extra pay but it'll be good for the experience.
Don't do it
"Very busy place, no work life balance."
"It is insanely busy ok if you like being stressed out not very great managers, very stressful!"
No work life balance.
Also clients can be very rude because of staffing issues
Not a decent place to work for the long term.
Theirs no work/life balance. .
The only positive is that it's remote.
"Other than that, just run."
Morale is low.
There is no work life balance.
Call Volumes are high because of the new bank acquired.
Good company and good work culture .
There is lot of opportunities to learn and grow.
Good work life balance and people are knowledgeable of the processes and products.
However there is less transparency.
Don't do it.
Having to deal with the people that come into the bank is the worst part of the job.
the people that come into the bank constantly are yelling at you and trying to tear you down.
the bank treats you as less of a human being and more a robot who is supposed to come to the bank's every call and do absolutely everything the bank want no matter what or you're a terrible employee.
"I once had a family accident where a family member was in a car accident and taken to the hospital, I left 15 minutes early (at the end of the day , no customers were coming in and no work needed to be done)"
I got written up the next day after they said it was okay for me to leave.
Solid.
Great work life balance.
Good amount of time off and holidays.
Other benefits are okay.
Advancement can be slow but there are opportunities.
"Okay pay, after a few years they do pay more pending good reviews"
Work life balance doesn't exist! .
Management knows and is completely fine with the fact that all employees are overworked.
50-60 hours a week at minimum is not only welcome but expected.
Vacation?
Yea
right your work laptop is with you and you'll still put in a few hours a day.
Training did not even slightly prepare you for your job.
Great environment .
Loved this job.
Just outgrew this job.
Overall a wonderful company to work for.
The change to hours of operation is the biggest downfall.
The place begins to feel like a family for sure.
Great place.
Good place to work but hours need to be changed!
Even Saturday need to be rotated for all employees.
We have our life outside of the company.
Overall great place to work
The job was not enjoyable.
Micromanaging was a major pain point. .
The job is tedious.
The account holders are rude.
My manager was never available when needed yet somehow micromanaged my every move.
Training was insufficient.
"Tons of info is crammed into 15 min meetings, there's no room for questions lest we go 1 sec over."
High expectations with minimal support.
"Enjoyed working with this bank, but feeling overworked, overstressed and underpaid is the reason in which I chose to leave this bank.."
"Enjoyed working with this bank, but feeling overworked, overstressed and underpaid is the reason in which I chose to leave this bank."
"this bank had a great team environment, great support while in training, but you truly have to be self reliant afterwards and be proactive on your training and information retention."
Branch Manager can make job difficult .
"It is so unfortunate that my experience resulted in poor taste, as I was diligent throughout the interview process, even when I was chosen as a 2nd option."
Which didn't change my enthusiasm-and I was eager to move forward.
I was met with quite a bit of resistance from the branch Manager in my new hire training and I found that odd considering the position needed filled.
"Hopefully, there can be more rigorous checks and balances pertaining to managerial conduct."
"Otherwise, the customers were mostly pleasant!"
I also received some great reviews from the customers.
Ok place to work.
Ok place to work .
"Work life balance is great , however not much room for growth worse if you are part time!"
I didn't get much benefit so I cannot comment on that aspect
Never Again!!!.
"If you have struggle with severe anxiety like me, this job is not the job for you."
"You will be training for a few weeks, learning and doing homework then they throw you on the phone but with little support."
"Every day I had nothing but people calling in screaming at me, and when you reach out for help from retail support you get nothing but rude responses from fellow COWORKERS."
"Managers micromanage you and don't give you clear answers on how to improve, Managers just throw articles in your face"
so if you are hands on it takes multiple mistakes to learn anything.
"Managers have unrealistic goals Managers want you to meet and Managers don't care about you as a individual, Managers only care about numbers."
You will be monitored on every single thing you are doing.
"The only thing that ever made this job worth staying was the money, expensive health insurance."
"this job made me so extremely unhappy, stressed and anxious every single day."
Do yourself a favor and don't work here.
Good pay and incentive pay.
Micromanaging is out of hand..
Micromanaging is over the top.
It's like you're a child.
They like to sit in with you and your customer to watch everything you do even if you are a top performer.
This causes a lot of anxiety and stress and is shown to inhibit performance.
You've trained me and I've passed all the classes/training/observations.
I'll ask for help if I need help.
Now leave me alone and I will soar!!
Can be a great place to work depending on your position.. Worked in multiple positions in this company.
"As a Teller, I loved what I did."
Always felt as though management had my back and wanted to see me succeed.
"As a customer care consultant, it was the total opposite."
Only cares about money..
The company does not care about you as a person.
"The only thing The company care about is making money off the customers, not for the customers well being."
Awful work hours.
Great place .
Great friendly environment to work in.
Lots of regular customers who you learn to see every day and develop relationships.
Talked away so it can be hard to promote incentives
Outdated dinosaur trying to survive..
"Limited collateral options, and slowing moving back office."
"this bank is a dinosaur technology wise internally, and will go the way of the dodo if this bank don't streamline processes."
"Solid financial products, and good vision in some areas but lost in the sauce in others."
"this bank coach to career growth, but when you ask about advancement you are told to wait."
Great chance to learn and grow.
This company was a great start for someone in banking to learn the functions of a bank.
You will be thoroughly trained in your role.
Great place to work overall the pay is very competitive.
Good and supportive coworkers.
Short staff all the time because they keep cutting positions. .
It is not a bad place to start your carrier and to learn about banking but if you want to stay there think about it because you are going to work the whole day almost every day no days off.
unrealistic sales goal and it's all about sales.
Some Bad and rude manager's's even if you give a bad review for Some Bad and rude manager's of course nothing happens Some Bad and rude manager's just make you look bad because Some Bad and rude manager's get the information
so Some Bad and rude manager's know who gave Some Bad and rude manager's the score and the will come after you to find a reason to write you up or possibly fire you .
Forget about being a supervisor because you have to do the job so you basically have just the title more work and less pay .
"Great company, excellent benefits, pay could be a little higher.  "
"this bank is great, lots of opportunities for growth and amazing access to all sorts of different training."
Supportive atmosphere.
"The benefits are impressive: good healthcare plus HSA with employer contribution, fertility assistance, maternity leave paid at 100%, 401k matching, pension, etc."
Only downside is the salary is on the lower side.
But may be worth it for the decent work life balance.
Good company .
Opportunity for growth.
High bonuses.
Great benefits.
Nice 401k plan.
"You will get earn good money, but you'll work extremely hard for every cent."
Flexible hours
and they offer work at home.
"Overall a great place to work, but not necessarily compensated on the higher end. ."
"Overall a great place to work, but not necessarily compensated on the higher end."
Great benefits and great management.
Sometimes the constant restructuring can get confusing
Great Place to work.
Great place to work.
Managers push metrics and advancement in the company.
There is always room for growth.
Very diverse environments and lots of peer appreciation.
Highly cultured environment.
It's ok.
Pay isn't great and raises are extremely low.
Hard to gain experience to move up in the company.
Must be willing to jump around from one department to another to potentially gain experience.
Health benefits and retirement benefits are good.
Lack of growth/High turnover.
I worked at this bank for 6 years.
"High turnover, poor pay and lack of growth."
this bank want to you sell yet you can never leave the branch due to no staff.
Boys club.
Good Starter Company.
Good Starter Company is good for people just starting out in the financial world and needing to gain experience.
"PTO is great 1st year, you have full access to those benefits, on a prorated basis, at hire."
Management micro managers and is tough.
Sales are pushed heavily despite extremely reduced traffic in the branches due to promoting 'self-banking' technologies so heavily.
You are expected to cold call a minimum of 10 dials a day.
Some of the conversations with customers are very difficult as customers are very irritated by all the changes at this bank.
"Financial centers have caused a lot of customer dissatisfaction and reduced traffic even more, putting a lot of pressure on employees to meet sales goals"
Exciting job .
Pro: financial education development and learning about the ins and out of financial institutionsCon: not much growth in terms of in branch services
but I'm sure there are more opportunities at bank level
this bank is overrated .  
this bank doesn't care about Pittsburgh anymore.
The only reason this bank have raised this bank's pay rates is because of Chase and Bank of America moving into Pittsburgh.
Chase and Bank of America don't care about your work life balance.
working here is okay.
The pay is okay if you are taking care of just yourself.
Mangers are kind and supportive.
i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hates when customers curse you out because customers do that a lot at this bank (everyone thinks because they have a few thousand dollars in there account a few thousand dollars are important).
"But if you learn to just tune everyone out and focus on doing your job right, its pretty much okay."
Employee focused.
I love working here.
The culture is great and the pay is good.
Great benefits including a company funded retirement.
Very supportive management and a good training program.
"Was a good job, but very focused on numbers. ."
My direct manager was very focused on numbers.
Every morning My direct manager would call out the person who preformed the worst the day before.
"Part time employees had to work every Saturday.. Would not allow us to trade if we needed a Saturday off, had to use PTO."
Okay Bank to work For.
"It's an okay bank to work for, the pay and the benefits are great."
"But you have to make 40-60 dials per day, every single day."
And it's hard when you have other things going on.
Stressful but ok.
Management was great but hard to get promoted callers screamed at you
but I did love working at home.
Hard to get different hours once you were in your set schedule
Its a good start into Banking.
I wouldn't plan on spending more than 3 years at the branch.
Banking's a great environment to learn more about banking and the banking industry as a whole if you have never worked in banking.
"You have some okay, normal benefits."
The only good thing is the pension you get vested into when you reach 3 years of working for this bank.
"However, that's where it stops."
"this bank are on the low end of the salary pool and even if you get promoted twice with this bank in 3 years, you'll always be making less of a salary of those in the same position in your area with any competitor."
Do not apply here..
"Do not apply with these people, these people lie about the compensation, about the job and everything else."
It was like working in a 3rd world nation.
Run away from this place if you can.
A great IT dept.
"I am dissatisfied with my role at this bank, but my role at this bank is in no way a reflection of the organization."
"my role at this bank is really just a boring job, and I should not have accepted my role at this bank."
my role at this bank is a great department and very supportive.
Just a bad fit personally for my role.
I would gladly accept another more interesting position in the organization and/or department.
Productive work environment .
"Easy advancement ,excellent training opportunities."
Great atmosphere!
Team work is incredible!
Easy access to all resources needed.
Job is amazing!
Recommend!
"People are great, benefits"
"okay, actual job is a trial."
I will say that the other people working here are generally really nice and helpful.
Management is super supportive.
Absolutely no complaints there.
"The insurance only offers high deductibles, which sucks if you have a chronic condition."
actual job is very emotionally draining.
Being on the phone all day with people having the worst days of people's lives and not really being able to do much is just awful.
Amazing .
"i love working in this bank but this bank push a lot in sales, if you are not a sales person this is not the right work for you, salary at first is nee but the rise is amazing"
Horrible.
My manager resigned 1 month into this role if that vtrr ed lols you anything.
Too many outdated systems.
Horrible loan pricing.
No accountability from management.
Hostile work environment.
Employee engagement is trending in the wrong direction.
This used to be a great place to work.
"Now, it's good."
"Compensation is below the market, the benefits are okay, but employee appreciation has lessened."
"Free this bank polos, sweatshirts, etc. for Employee Appreciation Week have been replaced with online word find games, the company've cut the extra week of vacation employees used to be able to buy, small things like that."
There's also emphasis on growing the company while shrinking the staff - more off-shoring and pushing people out.
"But it's hard to get fired for performance, so the low performers tend to stay forever while the best and brightest continue to leave."
"Teams are becoming more segmented, so the old career pathing is largely gone, it's become harder to move around in the company."
Change is inevitable .
They change and expect the same of employees.
Management expectations are high.
"this bank pays good, however this bank do not concentrate on employees development"
High sales pressure & favoritism .
"Very stressful atmosphere, sales pressure."
The pay was great but not worth the stress.
High deductible health plan was a little difficult with being a single parent.
Good starter job to get work experience.
enjoyed co-workers.
Training program was well organized.
Not the best advancement opportunities.
Didn't always do the job I signed up for.
Sometimes short staffed.
Poor management. .
Management kept rotating so often nobody knew nobody.
That would also mean that there was nobody there to attest to your hard work which would in the long run hinder your growth opportunities.
What else to say..working frontline for a bank : very low pay and lots of pressure.
"Frontline worker in a bank - of course Working for low pay, and lots of pressure to up-sell, i did not fall for a bank's up-sell pressure to my customers who, these people were nice people"
"but i could see these people struggle financially, so why would i follow what a bank says, and sell to these people even more debt these people cannot afford."
"So, I didn't do what bank told me, and avoided up-selling as much as i could."
There you go
I would not recommend.
I work for this bank as a customer service rep.
Very long work hours taking calls back to back.
I am very familiar with the call center environment and know this is to be expected but management is down your throat every step of the way.
the call center environment is such a toxic atmosphere.
The only perks are you get to do this from the comfort of your home.
Met some great people.
My Branch Mgr was great...
But the Teller lead was horrible...
No training.. Just threw me into the Teller lead..
Would be little me in front of customers...
Felt like i couldn't ask questions... couldn't take brakes...
Hours were weird 6 days...
But only worked 28 hrs
Good Internship Experience.
"Good Internship Experience was my first technical experience, and Good Internship Experience was give and take."
I learned a lot about the workforce life and agile terms.
"But in terms of projects, projects are not the most interesting."
Good benefits and opportunities .
"The benefits are good, plenty of opportunities across the US now due to acquisition."
In comparison to other banks the salary could be more competitive.
Ok .
Place was ok to work.
We did teller and platform.
Benefits were good.
Bonus was really good.
Had to deal with all sorts of customers and providing all sorts of customers products and services
Traveling RRT.
"They make you work 6 days a week, sometimes you're there from 8:45-6:15, absolutely insane."
I was hired for the rrt position which required me to be teller and banker when needed.
"The virtual training was okay but then being in the branches you'd had to ask for help and sometimes other team members couldn't be bother, so would have to figure it on my own."
A lot of the managers you'd meet can be very micromanage in sales.
A lot of the managers you'd meet expect you to throw a sales pitch at any client walking in.
A lot of the managers you'd meet push credit cards & loans application to clients but don't fully educate clients.
"A lot of the managers you'd meet also have a terrible metric system , if you are rated anything below 8, you'd have to take a class in customer service."
Even if something was not your fault but is just how the client feels about youAs an rrt most of the time your manager will be the regional manager and your manager hardly care about you but leave it to a branch manager to give you feedback.
"Benefits are okay, some branches better than others, they need to stop 6 days a week, overall a good bank if you want to get into banking."
Great management .
Caring and motivating managers who are invested in your career advancement.
Flexibility to work from home.
Can pivot to different groups with support of team if you aren't in love with your current role.
Fun and productive workplace .  
this bank is a great company in terms of diversity.
this bank present many opportunities for growth.
"Depending on the region/branch you work for, you may have very little work-life balance."
"When I first started, I worked overtime every week."
"Overall employees are treated with respect, the pay is on the lower level ."
"Great company for someone that's trying to build a career, but not really for your experienced worker who expects to earn a more competitive salary compared to many other FS companies."
Productive workplace.
Coworkers were very helpful.
Management made sure you were in a position to succeed.
I enjoyed coming to work.
The environment was very friendly and the locations was close to home.
Don't believe what you are told.
I was given a contract that was remote.
The position was difficult to do because of us being remote.
Training was very difficult.
Time was monitored way to close which put more pressure on you and your job.
Terrible place. .  
this bank became the worst place to work for in past few years.
"No recognition, no bonus."
All the company pushed for great customer service while having no staff to run this bank.
Pay was terrible with the amount of responsibility given.
I am glad I left when I did.
Wouldn't recommend the company to anyone let alone my friends or family.
"N/a.  this bank has great benefits, the compensation isn't really great."
You have a great work life balance.
There isn't B really much room for growth.
"I did enjoy working with my coworkers, my coworkers were all pretty nice."
You could use it as a stepping stone.
The work wasn't very complicated & the manager is super nice.
Overall this bank was a great experience for me.
Not For Me.
"The training was promising, the person who did the virtual training was nice, was a good start."
Once I got into the branch it was constant stress for laughably low pay.
All the managers knew how to do was micromanage and stress you out.
Also a lot of conflicting statements such as 'answer the phone' and then at another point if you answered the phone you would get in trouble.
Or 'don't be afraid to ask questions!'
then you'd ask a question and you'd get the equivalent of 'Google it.'
Then you'd get docked for not being quick enough despite being new and having a question and having to look up the answer yourself through a large ' this bank Edge' article which takes a considerable amount of time.
"I felt as I was absolutely set up to fail here, was not worth the stress, not worth the pay, and not worth having to work mostly 10 hour days."
Productive and fun workplace.
I absolutely loved working for this company.
I made the mistake of leaving because I thought I wanted to work in the medical field.
Unfortunately that backfired and now I'm trying to claw my way back into the business world.
"Good work-life balance, good people, decent work."
"Obviously a lot depends on your specific team/manager, but for the most part the people are pretty friendly, the work-life balance is either decent or good most of the time."
Pay/benefits is ok but not amazing by any means.
You learn a lot from some very smart people.
Competitive Salary and Benefits.
"Great pay , opportunity for growth."
Great Benefits.
Easy going work environment.
"Professional work environment , great colleagues, management is supportive."
Good and bad.
I am a long-time employee so I've seen the good and the bad from this company.
"Senior management tends to be heavily skewed to one particular demographic and it becomes apparent any time there's a change broached, such as updating WFH policies (although the pandemic has changed some of that)."
Insurance options stink and you have to fight for every raise you get.
Management would rather give one-time performance bonuses rather than a meaningful salary increase.
It is embarrassing to work for this company and then I have to tell my staff my staff're getting a 1.2% raise.
"That being said, some managers (particularly the younger ones) are excellent and understand the value of providing employees the space to do employees's jobs without micromanaging."
this company has made a huge push to increase D&I conversations and is making meaningful investments in the community.
I have had a wonderful experience so far.  
this bank has given me the opportunity to grow as an individual in my career and I have learned so much about myself as a leader.
Lower management has been top tier great and the teams I have got to work with make Lower management even better.
You can't beat the vacation and benefits here at this bank.
"Political cowards - I thought this bank was different, got Duped."
"PEOPLE ARE LEAVING this bank IN WAVES, NOT A STABLE PLACE TO WORK!!"
STAY AWAY!
I know it's long but please read it all.
I would like to point out that I am a minority and fit in the POC category who tries to show everyone with respect and promote inclusive behaviors that are appropriate for the workplace.
this bank does not hold those values and I feel I must speak up.
"When I started working here I had never felt so confident about a company, but since COVID and the political tension of the past year or so, this bank has really shown this bank's true colors and unfortunately it isn't a environment that is comfortable for all."
Which is why so many people are leaving.
"so many people want you to think so many people are growing with this new bank B merger but so many people are constantly closing and consolidating branches, loosing employees, and falling short on sales goals across multiple markets..."
so let's list some things so many people don't want you to know.*There this very reason NO work life balance.
Several college students or young mothers have quit for this very reason.
Hours have been extended during the week and weekend hours.
"under-staffing (a common theme here, sorry) has put a great strain on branches, Over-Time has not been approved so with extended hours this bank have to shave even more time off of this bank's schedules which leaves the under-staffed that much more strained."
this bank's customers also do not care for the new hours as Our customers regularly are upset with this bank Saturday mornings as Our customers have been waiting an hour for this bank to open and people really don't come after 12 on Saturdays or 5 during the week and most days after 4 it is dead.
Some - more...
Fun & relaxed workplace but not good competitive compensation .
"Good company to retire, good benefits and work life balance and job is secured, socialist approach.."
Can consider employee pay and growth as a company.
Caring management.
Management is easy to talk to and are supportive of staff career and development.
The company is growing so career opportunities will increase.
this bank is one of the best employers ive had.
Awful management.
The worst place I have worked at!
The gave ampule time to do the training but they barely did any training.
"Then once I got to the branch, I was expected to know everything without any help."
Management was a joke and will never bank or work there again.
Ok place to work .
They will train you there's a lot of places for you to get help if you don't know something but the pay is low.
"Advancing into a new position is pretty easy, after one year you speak with your manager about your goals"
Terrible .
Don't waste your time.
No raises.
No promotions.
"Managers are terrible, all Managers do is go out for lunch and leave early."
Coworkers get away with doing nothing and get paid more.
"Seriously, terrible company."
This company only cares about This company stupid numbers on This company's reports do not care about the people that work at branches.
Do not give you tools that work for you to be able to your job.
This company is a joke.
Absolutely no work/life balance at all.
Now have to work 6 days a week
"Strong, Inclusive Culture."
I'm impressed with the continued opportunity for growth inside the company.
Management seem to always be willing to guide toward goals and professional development that will allow for advancement.
Unfortunate Management at my site.
The job The job itself was not bad.
"However my manager promoted me without training me and would call out often, leaving me as the only banker with no support and very little understanding of what was expected of me."
It was highly stressful and difficult.
"Then I would be reprimanded for my mistakes and that was the only time management would talk to me, even though I had many questions that I asked for help with."
Shart on staffing.
Employees are expected to work short staffed most of the rime..
Micro management.
Staffing issues.
Expectations of management can not be met due to staffing issues.
Benefits could be better.
Experience in banking does not see to matter in internal job transfer requests.
"Good company, transparent ."
#NAME?
"Good Technology, Poor Pay and Promotion Opportunities ."
"Stressful, low salaries, poor career advancement opportunities, poor quality management."
Technology for employees and customers is good.
Usually have good offers and giveaways for customers.
Poor management .
Poor management.
Horrible growth opportunities.
They would rather hire from outside.
Employees are just a number.
CEO could care less about anything but the almighty dollar.
Spent months doing mandatory overtime.
Great Place To Work .
Pros:Very stable financial company.
Great benefits.
Risk averse.
Good diversity and inclusion policies.
Cons:Slow adoption of new technologies.
Heavy change management process.
"Meaningful work, fantastic team."
Compensation could definitely be better.
Base salary and incentive pay are not as competitive as other places. .
"Overall, a solid company to work for."
My team does meaningful work for employees across the enterprise.
Senior leadership support (several layers above me) can be a challenge.
This year has been challenging from a resource perspective.
Great flexibility.
Could move the needle on pay and not just the $18/hour population.
Mid career and senior level professionals need an adjustment too after not necessarily being paid competitively to the market.
"better work life balance, old timer culture, dark ages ."
"It's a good place for hours, bad for diversity and inclusion."
"Old school mentality, old technology, and unreceptive to new ideas."
They hire a lot of ‘diverse' candidates but keep a lot of ‘diverse' candidates at bottom of ladder.
No transparency on career advancement.
"Pros are flexible work arrangements and less stressful work, but depending on your manger you could be both stressed and underpaid."
Benefits and incentive get worse every year.
Used to be great place to work then begets changed to high deductible and incentive got cut even when company company itself would tell us how much profit company itself were making.
"Heres the thing, this bank started out fine."
"It was cool, it was all divine."
"When I first started with this bank it seemed like this bank had a good family feel in the company culture, but four years later it seems like this bank care less and less about the individual."
"Decisions are made about departments without anyone knowing what goes on in departments, and you generally find out you've been doing something wrong about a week later because no one bothers to communicate."
"The lower levels of management are amazing, but the higher ups are so out of touch."
Can work remote and there is good work life balance. .
I have a great manager which makes all of the difference.
My job is not hard because of repetition.
I am close to retirement so the opportunities are not there.
I have a good team that I work on.
No cut throats.
Constant restructuring.
There is a culture of restructuring in the company that can be very tiresome.
Endless meetings discussing new ways of doing things are in the way of actually doing things.
"It's a revolving door of strategies, people moving around the company."
Overall it seemed very chaotic and superficial.
"Benefits and other stuff like that are generous, I felt supported by management and never ran into any problems in regards to time off."
The day to day hugely depends on the immediate team and manager.
I had a fantastic one!
But it varies greatly based on my conversations with coworkers.
At the end of the day I did not feel challenged and fulfilled by what I was doing.
And the compensation is below average with no room for negotiation.
No work life balance.
There is no work life balance.
All u do is work work work work.
They are always short staff at every single branch.
The pay is so small for the amount of work load you have to do
Good flexibility.  
"this bank has great flexibility with working remotely, even pre covid."
The organization is large so sometimes it's hard to feel like your work is being noticed.
Bad management .
Great job.
Good people.
Terrible benefits.
If you don't want to aggressively climb the corporate ladder you are pushed out.
Whatever happened to being satisfied where you are ?
Don't care about employees.
All company cares about is how much money company are making.
company treat company's employees bad and only care if you are reaching your goals
.
company are very quick to fire people as well.
It's reasonable .
Can be stressful at times but not a bad place.
I worked from home so it can be on the boring tiring side.
Stay motivated and you can make the best of it.
Hard to get help from management when needed.
PTO and benefits were great.
Lack of help from management.
Training was very long yet inadequate for the role.
Very stressful even when working remotely.
Too many meetings about 'culture' and not enough time dedicated to answers for actual day-to-day work questions.
Very stressful the corporation thinks only for the top corporate people even sales people mean nothing.
Management is clueless expect the world from you and give only stress in return.
Management do not support you and Management take away your bonus structure with no notice at all.
this bank makes a lot of money for the corporate people but the ones in the face of retail this bank take away the bonus with no notice.
this bank are very shady with what the tell the employees
doesn't reward .
Tasked to do a ton of work without any sort of quality management concerns.
Feels like lack of reward to put additional effort in.
People are nice and increase to salary will be good.
"Great coworkers, room to move around."
"Overall, enjoyed my time working for the company."
"PTO was great, but leadership/managers could use a lot training and development."
Remote work was available for some during COVID-19
Stressful Job.
"Unrealistic monthly goals, management has no idea what happens on a day to day basis at branches and expect bankers to reach very unrealistic goals."
Micromanaging
Can be very stressful.
Grateful to be employed.
"Overall the customers are nice, the customers just get a little anxious to get to closing."
Can be very stressful & challenging due to high volume pipelines during this epic mortgage low rate period.
You have to be very organized & have a lot of patience for internal & external.
You are expendable .
"The best way that I can describe my experience with this bank (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly."
The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that middle management become exempt).
"Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in."
"The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year."
"If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition."
"The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input."
Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems.
Mistakes are made often because many people have no idea what many people're doing (through no fault of many people's own).
Imagine all of the bad/toxic managers you've ever had to work with all working in leadership positions at the same company.
You are actively encouraged to saddle individuals with banking products individuals don't need and if you are not cut-throat enough to sell a drowning man even more debt your other talents will not be appreciated.
"Aside from that, HR is a complete mess and will not help you with actually bad things (I.e. harassment) and turnover is high because all the wrong people are promoted (but hey, at least they can open 12 different checking accounts for the same person, not everyone can pull blood from a stone)."
"I did learn a lot in a short amount of time but that's really only because I'm self-motivated and a quick-learner; in my first year, my manager ran through literally 4 different new hires because: 1) literally 4 different new hires personally were very difficult to work for 2) had very high expectations and 3) wanted to put absolutely NO effort into helping to train the new people."
"I know there are a few good managers that work for this bank, but honestly do yourself a favor and go into this job either knowing you're in this job only for the resume experience or that you're okay with being an over glorified ATM that's expected to try to sell a credit card to every person you talk to in a given day."
Not The Best Place To Work.
Unattainable goals and not a great culture.
Lunch breaks can be really short and expect to work on weekends.
Unreasonable sales goals & unreasonable metrics.
Ok.
"Ok place, good culture, poor pay, bad management."
Would go back for better pay and maybe different role.
Teller lead role is underpaid and underappreciated.
"Great ppl , great staff ."
"I like how biracial it is, the customer are nice."
Management is '
so so' you may.
Get some nice higher ups every now and again.
"The branch I worked for was great Bc we were like a family, never felt like work."
"The pay is ok for a bank but I should be paid at LEAST 1.00 above my rate due to all the work that Bankers must do , pay = 18.00 ph with bonus if You meet your goals but only if you meet the goals set for you."
Benefits are ok I won't complain.
Vacation is good.
Stressful and pressure to make sales.
Stressful and pressure to make sales over giving the kind of service customers actually want.
Terrible salary for someone with a bachelor's degree and in one of the highest cost of living areas in the nation.
Negative energy.
"I am a former employee at PC I worked at the Charlestown Road New Albany, IN 47150 location."
I was there for a few months and the negativity was enough for me.
I was ready to leave after the first month.
The women that worked there never smiled and were just down right miserable.
The tellers and the management.
I don't believe anyone there actually like to help people at all.
The tellers and the management took the call blocking very serious.
The tellers and the management used the call blocking as a second lunch break.
You could clearly see The tellers and the management on Facebook or doing online shopping.
The tellers and the management would make people wait until people were fully ready to do people's job.
Just ok.
Some days are slow some days are non stop customers from opening to closing.
There's times when you are the only teller on duty leaving you with a lobby and drive thru lanes piling up with angry customers.
Fun place to work with the right people.
Excellent work atmosphere.
High sales pressure despite the Wells Fargo scandal.
"Work hours for management were outrageous, with often six days a week."
Mandatory conference calls when sales goals were not met on any day.
Many late night and horrible work/life balance.
For the TIS (IT) side of the business the TIS (IT) side of the business's the worst company I've worked for.
"Too many meetings to get any work done, every team is too silo'd, horrible bureaucracy and processes that make 15 minute jobs take days for approvals with late night changes, and every IT team is very under-staffed for the amount of work needed."
Loved this bank.
I worked for this bank 4 years!
"I loved working for this bank, this bank just do not have much of a good work/life balance."
Well this bank do have vacation time but you have to work a certain amount of time to achieve vacation time when you first start working for this bank.
Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised.
"Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality."
"The faster you work, the more praise you get."
"In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct."
"If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on."
"Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for other work not to be able to be finalized."
"This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since my previous work was pushed back to accommodate other rush files."
Those that fly through Those that fly through their files and have high numbers's files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par.
"Pay is not competitive with other banks, even though this bank is the fifth largest bank, this bank still refuse to offer a decent pay, especially for the amount of stress the job causes."
this bank prides this bank on inclusion and diversity but I did not feel or see inclusion and diversity while working here.
"In my experience, trying to move around in the company is a hassle."
"I tried to get off the team I was on several times, applying for different positions and was always told the team I was on are on a hiring freeze."
The only positive I can say is the remote work.
"Other than the remote work be prepared to be stressed out, over worked and underpaid."
I loved working there. .
Everything was a learning experience and I miss the team.
I learned a lot of things working for the company and Meg plenty of different ppl.
"I had a lot of work to do throughout the day, and I enjoyed a lot of work to do throughout the day."
low pay.
In this role low pay good benefits.
Typical day at work sitting at your desk the entire time.
Competing for available work with co workers work to make numbers.
Quality of work is irrelevant just speed.
Overall good workplace but management and scheduling improvements needed....
"With this bank work life balance, it's important to understand each branch is different according to the manager."
Some managers understand that work is work and there is some form of life outside of this bank
"so Some managers'll stick to the 8 - 5 schedule; however, others do not."
"There is a lot of scheduling outside of typical 8-5 hours, for example rotating every other Friday until 6:15pm and then Saturdays quarterly."
"I can count on more hands than two the times I've had to stay late, come in early, or be sent to another branch over 25+ minutes away to help out at a moment's notice just in two months time."
"These requests disrupt the work-life balance because you basically cannot expect to get to any other commitment (daycare, appointment, etc) on time once you leave the office because you won't leave the office on time."
"Honestly, if we could get out the door according to schedule, the work-life balance would be great."
"When it comes to compensation/benefits, there's a lot of murkiness."
"You're asked to train two to four people and pick up slack in a short staffed branch because you've done such an outstanding job in your current role, but come annual review time your raise will not even be enough to make a noticeable difference."
They will keep piling the additional responsibilities on to you but not compensate you for the additional responsibilities.
I believe my pay check's taxes for one pay period was more than my most recent raise for the whole entire year.
This seems a little confusing as usually commended performance is compensated fairly and a 'Meets or Exceeds Expectations' rating should be a valid defense for at least - more...
Culture and system issues.
The brand and the management are lacking badly.
I was promised things that never panned out.
the management is more interested in conference calls and the management's own compensation.
Former Employee.
"The company was not bad overall, it was more so the management that was there at the time."
The employees The employees themselves were great and really helped each other succeed.
Management did not always recognize or value Management's employees.
Draining .
The job is very draining and the success stories on advancement are lies when you look up and see you still in same dept years later.
The pay is nice but not worth the mental stress
Productive and great workplace.
It was good definitely comes with a bunch of pros to it than cons.
They are very flexible in case an emergency happens or right after a certain life event .
The worst bank to work for.
I worked here for less than 3 months.
"Management is terrible, with little to no support and Management expect you to train, hit your goals, and do daily outbound calls all in 1-2 months and show numbers or else Management threaten your job security."
Mind you training takes up almost 1.5 months and most of your day.
Pay is acceptable but Pay doesn't go up much from there and you're subject to only a few other career options within Management.
Boring and unchallenging workplace .
I worked for this bank for almost two years and had three different positions (and seven different bosses) during my tenure.
The work was customer service-based and extremely boring when The work wasn't soul crushing.
The underwriter job posting was also extremely misleading and I was severely underpaid.
"Innovative bank, customer focused.."
"Customer focused bank, technology is up to date and always improving."
If you work diligently and stay focused on the customer you can advance in your career path.
Conducive to work at.
I will like to work for this company for as long as I am able to work.
"My schedule is suitable, work environment conducive and team mates cooperative."
Management maybe on your head at times but Management's normal though.
"Productive job, sense of accomplishment ."
"Work holidays, management not always helpful depends who you get."
"Stuck to desk , very limited on bathroom breaks etc outside scheduled breaks."
Short lunch.
Limited growth unless management likes you.
benefits.
advancement can be limited in certain product lines.
Management does try to make inclusive and work/life balance is considered important.
Health benefits are good.
Great opportunities for advancement in a very inclusive and diverse work environment .  
this bank pays well and advances employees very quickly.
Benefits are good.
Work life balance is a bit of a struggle though.
this bank try to make Work life balance a priority but then a project comes along and deadlines need to be met.
All in all this bank are a great company to work for.
"Benefits, promotions, raises."
"Great place to work, great promotion, raises are great, awards, coaching positive feed back , great schedules, nice management great workers, best quality of life"
Great place to start working for your first job.
Enjoyed working in the wealth management development program.
There was a great month long training in their head quarters and then you get placed in an office.
"I would work there again, but it just wasn't for my career goals."
"Great Company, Great Comp and Benefits, Strong Leadership.  "
"Great Company is a company that takes the time to think through an approach, cares about Great Company's employees, and tries to make the best possible decisions."
"Great Company is a great place to build your career, work with a diverse set of people, and feel supporting across multiple aspects of your life."
"Parental leave policy is top notch, career paths are there."
Was a great company pre-covid.
"After covid hit, they've taken away all incentives and bonus for hitting your financial goals, but your financial goals increased."
You now have to work 6 days a week to make 40 hours.
"And with the whole world going through a financial crisis they're pushing sell, sell, sell and It feels very scummy."
A lot of changes .
Took away incentives and stuck me with a fix salary that was way less than I was making with my incentives a lot of stress when covid came about you pretty much wa fed to the wolves with the work load .
And force to take calls from other departments .
Very sad I joined.
I joined this bank out of compulsion.
Though this bank talk about vision and value.
It is all about this bank and this bank's benefits.
this bank don't care about this bank's customers or this bank's employees.
very shallow and self centered company.
at least that is what I faced working at Morrow Ga Facility.
Nor company Nor this bank's employees are friendly.
this bank mean business but how this bank work on business is amazing.
"Team Sucks, Team Playing is 3 out 10."
Team Playing are ready to throw you under the bus any day anytime.
Privacy of customers or employee is not protected by any means.
Employees talking to customers or other employees about account or customer info in the lobby or in drive thru is open and loud in the branch.
other can hear and know lot of personal info about other clients and finances and funds or situation thru out the lobby.
Not sure weather your private info is protected at all.
Anyway I m glad to be out of there.
Great place to work and gain experience in the banking field.
It was a great location and the job was nice with great life and work balance.the job is not hard and the job requires to have a solid understanding of what is customer service as that is your main responsibility.
Overall would highly recommend! .  
this bank as a whole is a very great company to work for.
"this bank as a whole does have a sales culture, but management is very good at training you to perform in your role."
this bank as a whole has taught me tricks of the trade that I value and have carried out to other business ventures.
Inclusion and Great Management.
Great management; if you show that you are of value and contribute to your team then management will ensure you are having the best work life possible
Good short term option.
"From when I started, to when I left, almost every employee was looking for a new job, applying to different positions, or just actually leaving."
The turn over is unlike anything I've ever seen.
The workplace is extremely toxic and The workplace is soul killing.
"I will say that this position may be okay short term, but working here any longer than short term is not a good choice."
productive workplace.
"typical mortgage calls, learned new skills, culture is very rewarding, hardest part of the job....there isn't one."
"its an easy job, you're home which is the best"
Not the Bank for career moves.
"Every morning, I'd wake up and dread coming to work when I was an RRT."
You never know which branch you'd go to for the day.
"Sales goals were attainable, but it is a 'what have you done for me lately' environment"
so things did not matter from yesterday.
"Not much in terms of PTO, lower side of 401(k) employer match, and even worse pay."
"Bonus structure was alright, but if you don't hit a specific threshold, then you could forget about any bonus."
"Immediate Branch Management was ok, Immediate Branch Management picked favorites, but would not really play favoritism."
"Upper Management is trash and would not care if you got hit by a car, just as long as you hit your goals to so they could pack their bank accounts."
"Covid made things worse branch employees, no raises, and if we had symptoms we were forced to use our own time to stay home, which is not really fair."
"Opportunities for advancement are great, Pay... not so much. .  "
this bank is an okay company to work for.
"If you are looking to learn the basics of banking, this bank is a good place to start."
"However, the upper management shows little regard for employees well-being."
401k match is 4 percent which is nice.
3 weeks vacation time and 5 sick day per year plus federal holidays off.
"That being said, the hourly wage at this bank is lower than most every other bank."
Minimum wage here is $15.00 an hour VS the competitors starting at $18.00.
The commission structure for the bankers is difficult to understand and does not pay out well even when exceeding goals.
They took away commission opportunities for tellers which has negatively impacted the moral.
"Also, this bank likes to change this bank's technology frequently which is stressful for the employees."
Very stressful job with terrible schedule.
Typical day at work will be answering calls and talking with a lot of irate customer.
Some of a lot of irate customer are very rude and use profanity.
The job is very stressful and underpaid.
"The hardest part is when you need help or you have escalation on the line, no one will help you even your manager."
workplace culture.
I loved my Job in Recovery.
But the bank decided that we needed to collect on any account in recovery.
So the bank gave us old Home loans that were charged off for years.
the bank gave us one hour training to learn a new system to collect the payments on.
a new system to collect the payments on wasn't communicating correctly with other systems.
We were also dealing with lawyers calling in asking about these accounts.
So this mess was a big mess.
We were put on live calls fumbling our way through trying to please the customers and lawyers calling in.
We were advised to take messages and someone would call them back with the information you are requesting or an answer to your question.
No one called them back so we would get another call from the lawyer or customer fuming as no one has gotten back with the lawyer or customer.
Horrible stressful work environment.
After dealing with this mess I left the bank after working there for 13 years.
We got paid incentive for the dollars we collected on but if you were doing your job correctly and helping customers.
You were on the bottom of collection $$ because you spent your day dealing with calls.
It was pitting all employees against all employees and not helpful to any this bank customer.
Best thing I did was leave the bank.
Sucks working here .
"Poor pay for so much workManagement needs to be trained ,terrible management Micro managedNeed to replace with new and proper efficient management Bathroom time is micro managed Hostile environmentCompensation sucks"
Bad working experience.
Poor everything regarding management and pay.
Management is poor and CEO don't care.
Send a note to Corporate and no response of working environment.
I worked here for sixteen years.
Good Company.
They are accommodating and encourage growth.
PTO was nice.
Bank holidays.
Worked in branch and then transferred to remote and it was like working for a different company as far as HR things go.
Management was horrible.
I would never repeat my experience there again.
Management was horrible and the stress placed on the employee is real bad.
They will threaten you if you don't do as they say.
Poor management. .
Untrustworthy management and coworkers.
Poor leadership.
Very little training.
Low pay in comparison for industry.
Unrealistic sales goals.
No corporation from branch.
You will never get a raise and your job is never safe.
The title sums it up-
don't expect a raise and don't ever assume that your position is safe.
"I was there for two years and was considered an expert on every one of my department's's complex processes, yet I still was not deemed eligible for a merit increase due to the impossible QR standards."
"A few months later, 30% of my department's processes were automated, leaving a great deal less work to spread around."
"Rather than look to diversify my department's's workload to other projects and tasks, my department's was downsized one person at a time."
"The incapable, shady management does not care about The incapable, shady management's employees."
Do not work here.
Front Line Workers Get No Recognition .  
"Meetings that are really focus on the manager and bankers meeting there goals, never any conversations that help build teller engagement."
"Yet tellers get the bad end of the stick with incentives being taking away and being short staff tellers make it seem like tellers are not doing tellers's jobs because tellers cant have the conversations the way tellers would like tellers to, do to long lines and customers being impatience."
Management is very contradicting when it come to your schedule and vacation time approval.
No one is promise tomorrow yet the end of the year.
"Yet that want you to give them yo vacation time by end of January like year hasn't even started for time to see what's going on in spring, winter, and fall to enjoy."
When you try to ask to rearrange things because of an event you may want to take time off for it's an issue.
I can say the only thing I will take from this employment is the finical education I have gain and has help me out a lot in my personal life to learn and understand how money works in different ways.
this bank Doesn't Care.
Really high metrics to meet.
Team Leads and mentors don't know answers or care to find out.
Team Leads and mentors constantly changing and 'going on vacation' during periods when you need Team Leads and mentors most.
You have to train your body to use the bathroom during your breaks or you'll get yelled at.
"Handle time and adherence is shoved down your throat, Team Leads and mentors don't take any excuses for whatever reason for not meeting these metrics."
"Get used to being on the phone CONSTANTLY, there is no time to breath, you will hate being on the phone after this job."
"Even pay, lack of career growth.."
"Even pay, lack of career growth."
Employed since 2018.
Handled pandemic fairly while still keeping employees at work.
Not much room to grow a career at this time.
Just don't apply.
"If you value career advancement, a healthy work life balance and a safe environment during a global pandemic The company is not the company for you."
The company is solely out for The company no benefit at all to the frontline employees
Great work environment .  
this bank is a wonderful place to work.
this bank care about all of this bank's employees and clients on the same level.
The team that this bank have around you is more of a family environment making it a joy to work.
It is ok.
The CEO is political which I think is unprofessional.
The CEO states The CEO's opinion as fact even though The CEO is wrong.
My direct supervisor is awesome and makes the job bearable.
The sales compensation is pretty good which is one of the few perks you can enjoy if you can handle the sales pressure that is.
Family oriented company.
I love this bank.
"Even thought this bank is a big financial institution, the company is still very family oriented."
the company still care for the employees and employees quality life.
this bank is a safe and secure place to work.
I truly love my this bank!!
Work Environment.  
this bank provides an inclusive and exciting work environment.
this bank offer many opportunities for growth within the company.
this bank do not pay fair wages for this bank's hardest and most loyal workers.
an ok place to work.  
this bank has multiple places you can be.
right now in my position as a universal branch banker.
"I deal with different cliental, with different situation but it is still a same each day every day."
"everyone will tell you that its a different thing each day, that is untrue."
I work six days a week every week since I have been hired at this new position.
"I have to completely block out dates to get those days off or even get a two day weekend, when I have been told it would only be like that two to three weeks out of the month."
promises here at this bank are rarely kept.
"expectations are too high on lower employees, but this bank's a great place to work when your a single mother or a newly graduated out of high school."
pay is good for the moment but its really nothing you can live on these days comfortably.
Good Company.
Good inclusive company to work for.
Plenty of room for economic mobility if you apply yourself.
Lots of diversity and inclusions groups available to join
Great place to work.
It's a great place to work.
Great benefits.
One of few companies to still offer a pension.
"If you're willing to put in the work, your bonuses can be significant."
Okay Place to Work.  
this bank is very sales oriented.
Management differs from location but its the higher management that brings down the stress onto the employees.
The system is very old as well (not user friendly and do not be surprised when The system crashes).
"Be ready to make outbound calls to the same people over and over again to sell the same people credit cards, checking accounts, etc. and most do not reply."
this bank has pretty good benefits but not the best out there.
There are some good workers there but there are others that are bad like in other places.
Pay for the work is low in my opinion.
Not known in texas.
"It was a good effort by middle management but the goals were unattainable due to lack of communication , underwriting was not on same page as employees , cannot meet goals with UW delays"
Fine atmosphere but retail banking is severely underpaid .
As a Financial Sales Consultant I was very under compensated and the tellers were even more under paid.
Huge company so easily lost in the woodwork.
I worked with some good people there and some good people provided training but overall you are not appreciated.
run.
training is far and near tbh.
management is all new and not capable of training new hires.
HR request are even slower.
The center are all lacking business so it is impossible to learn and grown
Average.
It is a decent job overall.
"Not particularly easy or hard, but the training for my role was very thorough."
Volume and frequent policy changes can be challenging.
Loan processing software not very user friendly.
Good work/life balance with remote hours.
Would have stayed longer but it was time to move on.
too big.  
this bank has gotten too big.
The culture is pleasant.
"The benefits are good, but the compensation is bad."
this bank seems more dedicated to being social justice warriors than this bank is to this bank's employees.
"This is not a fun place to work, you cannot make a mistake. ."
You are processing Retirement plans a person's future is in your control.
Their is no room for error.
I did not enjoy working there.
"If you are new, you get assigned the most difficult plans to work on because the experienced people will not work on the most difficult plans to work on."
"Extremely depressing, impossible quotas to meet."
This position is VERY sales oriented.
At no point in the recruitment process was I informed that This position would be so sales focused.
"65% of customers are awful, the rest are fine or the rest are old and mentally unstable and you never know how they will treat you."
Systems are E X T R E M E L Y outdated and very hard to get a hang of.
Upper management are all disingenuous corporate robots on a race to the top.
"Products are mediocre and it is not in the customer's best interest to use any of Products, yet you have to keep peddling Products."
"Be prepared to make outbound calls to current customers, most of which will not answer nor will they be interested in speaking to you if they do answer."
There is no culture here.
"The hardest part of the job is dealing with the horrible customers, and having to move extremely quickly for the horrible customers on your awful system in order to keep the horrible customers happy."
(the horrible customers will be angry regardless).
"The only enjoyable part of the job is speaking with normal customers and meeting new people, but after the abundance of negative experiences I've had I've learned to walk on eggshells with the customers."
Work from home opportunities .
After covid hit it is now work from home which was a plus.
Job is stressful dealing with people upset a lot wish there was more time off the phone.
Breaks are nice and vacation and maternity leave
Just OK.
"It is a solid place to work for those just starting out, it can be tense as there are layoffs that occur semi-regularly, other than that its pleasant to work there day to day."
Solid bank with poor leadership at the local level.
Well respected bank where you can learn a lot.
They recently acquired bank B so in theory that should create more opportunity for advancement.
The problem is that it's difficult to advance even as a top performer unless you get into the right circles.
Some play the internal networking game better than others and are able to advance their careers without merit
Good job for people in different seasons.
This was a great entry level job to get your foot in the door.
However it is production based and schedules differ.
"Part time was great for someone finishing school, wanted time home with kids, or riding out until or during retirement."
Really enjoyed this department and the people but unfortunately our remote location was laid off but many were able to find new jobs within the company.
Looks like the company may be opening positions after letting us go which is unsettling to see but good position if you're interested.
Co workers are awesome but job is ok.
Love the people I work with.
We try to make the best of each day but sometimes you just can't enjoy it.
Bank is old and charge so many fees to Bank's customers.
The bad.
Senior management ..
Senior management only concerned about the bottom line.
Senior management treat employees as a cost item and had no problem cutting whole departments to improve EPS.
I did very little while I was there.
Most days I was in my office looking for busy work until the end of the day.
Stressful.
"The job is very demanding, with large asks of employees on weekly deadlines."
"The job is performance based (lots of metrics used to gauge performance), so any mishaps can be very discouraging."
Branch support hotline specialist .
I have worked at this bank within different position but this by far is the most challenging.
It a a very strict call center environment with calls non-stop which means bathroom breaks are limited to two 15 minutes and only a 30 minute lunch.
As stressful as this position is due to branch employees rude outbursts more is needed.
Vacation time is given but VERY hard to accommodate as you only get what's available per the vacation schedule for the entire department.
Love the people I work with .
The only thing truly keeping me is the people I work with.
"There are great benefits like 401k match and pension, we used to get referral incentives but referral incentives have been taken away, it made making referrals fun and exciting because it was something to work for."
Stressful.
"Very stressful, back to back phone calls, and working weekends."
I could not handle the high stress call center environment and I had to resign.
Two years working there and I could not take it anymore.
Just No.. Management picks favorites and runs with that.
Forget about advancement.
Toxic work environment.
This place was the reason I quit banking altogether and would never go back.
Very good place to work.
I have enjoyed working here for the most part.
I have had great managers and have had a lot of room to grow.
I have heard many people talk about the management but I have never had a bad experience.
"After working there over 12 years, I was let go after a medical disability leave.."
Wonderful experience the first ten years working there.
Then my management changed.
The next boss was nonexistent as a manager; never treated me kindly or fairly.
Then my job was 'eliminated' and I found an opening in another department.
another department was not a good fit and had a different culture than what I was used to.
"I then had a medical condition arise quite suddenly, and was on LTD for a while."
"After being released, I was given a specific amount of time to find another internal position - at the ONSET of Covid spreading all over the country."
"There were no internal jobs posted for my experience level or office position, so I was let go after the number of days allotted for me to obtain a new job."
"I once loved working there, was proud of my employer and worked my butt off on many nights & weekends to meet deadlines, I had fantastic bosses (except the last one) and was very disappointed at not being able to continue my employment."
"Other than that, good company."
Its alright.
If you want a personal life don't work at a branch in a grocery store.
the hours are long and short lunches.
Im still considered new but Im already looking to move to a different branch
#NAME?
Senior management says one thing and does another.
Too much pressure to achieve goals causing employees to become product pushers- much the same as Wells Fargo.
Constantly changing focus and directions and extremely structured environment- turning employees into product pushing robots.
Mandatory 6 day work week for all- absolutely no work life balance.
Regional Manager was inexperienced in managing and was unethical.
Reliable income but management can't be trusted.
"My job was fine, no complaints about day to day, but when it came time to be considered for any kind of promotions, management will be sneaky and do outside hires."
A position opened in my branch that I expressed interest in multiple times to my branch manager.
No job posting was listed and my branch manager continuously told me that my branch manager would keep an eye on A position for me.
"A couple weeks later, a new girl from another company somehow got A position when A position was still never posted."
I did not stay long after that.
No. Job is an okay starter position be prepared to have to kiss butt to actually make it within the company.
If you are looking to stay stagnant for a while by all mean work here
Corporate .
Very pushy on sales but nice people I would work here again if I was ever interested in working in banking again opposed to other banks very up to date and modern .
great work life balance.. the way this bank handle the pandemic showed that this bank care for this bank's employees.
"As banking needs continue change as well as the economy, it's good to work for this bank."
We are like one big family.
"I work with a great group of people, we get along well like we are family."
"when you fist start you get three weeks vacation, all of the major holidays off, plus paid time off."
"Low pay, lacks motivation ."
The pay is very low for the amount of work you're expected to do.
Walmart and Burger King pays more so that should be a red flag.
"Also, the bank has this survey system which is barbaric in rating the bank's employees."
"That is, if you get a 9 out of 10 you're an under-performing employee."
It is extremely demotivating and addressing it with management is practically useless.
You're basically told you need to get over it.
My experience there wasn't a good one.
The daily stress isn't worth the lack of compensation and the lack of motivation and purpose doesn't make it much better.
Awesome place to grow.  
"this bank is an awesome place to work and grow,I have learned so many different areas in the financial business."
The management really cares for you and your success
Pay not worth it .
"Overall was an okay experience , pressure was too real here ."
Managers did not know how to communicate and most of time scolded employees who weren't performing.
Fast paced work .
Fast paced work is a good place to work as long as you don't mind a fast paced work environment.
You just have to learn how to keep your productivity up with good quality you have a chance to earn bonus money.
A hot mess.  
this bank does not know how to manage this bank's size and this bank's volume of business.
Since before I started there has been mandatory OT and application dates that are months old leaving this bank with highly upset customers and rushing to clean up the mess all the while using the phrase 'business as usual'.
Upper management comes up with 'fixes' but has no idea what the day to day role is and continue to make the day to day role increasingly more difficult.
Before I started someone that did not work for this bank said someone that did not work for this bank heard this bank was a sweat shop and honestly that is a good description.
OT is mandatory and the only way to possibly meet management demands.
"Good for the paycheck, but for quality of life."
this bank also recently made the change that employees can roll over 3 vacation days.
"After two years, employees previously could buy an additional week of vacation but with the change that employees can roll over 3 vacation days, employees now only have the option to buy 2 days, reducing the number of days employees can take off each year."
Average.
Very 'corporate'.
"Being a bank, you get the bank holidays off, but everything else is very dry and very bland corporate atmosphere."
Huge push for employees to go back in office even for positions that require no face to face interaction.
A Job.
A Job was a job and that is about it.
Management was overly stressed.
Bankers had very high unattainable goals.
Constantly feeling pressured to make a sale even if a sale is not what is best for the customer.
Typical day would be morning meeting at 8:15am.
morning meeting at 8:15am was semi nice discussing what would occur for the day and everyone would say a goal for the day also.
Then go to my desk and log in to my systems/ check emails.
"Wait for customers to come in to provide service or lobby engage by standing in the lobby and directing customers to either a teller, banker, or manager."
While at your desk you are expected to document each interaction as well as have one sales conversation.
This company is only good to work for if you are extremely money driven.
Underdog:).
This work was indirect work.
Meaning that a company I worked for had a contract for maintenance three to four days a week.
"Therefore, in accordance with a contract for maintenance three to four days a week the questions pertain to."
Not directed toward this bank completely.
Fun place to work.
I worked as a teller.
The work/life balance was amazing.
I loved i could go home and not have to worry about my job.
The training is in depth and make sure you are comfortable before you start in a branch.
Terrible benefits.
Good work life balance.
Great work life balance if not in operationsTerrible benefits regarding health planBelow average compensation
No raise for most promotions 1% average raises per year
Good if you need a job but all they care about is sales goals etc.. Training is terrible.
Training doesn't prepare you for what happens in a daily environment.
Management (depending on who you have) can be helpful or not if their not focused on their own problems.
The only thing that saved me from not running around with my head cut off was previous banking experience.
Turnover rate is high because the environment is toxic.
Poor training .
Crammed info into your head and expected you to retain info.
Put on the phones prematurely without enough prior access to the systems used everyday.
Typical call center metrics and coaching.
Very regimented.
Had a positive experience working at this bank.
The majority of management were friendly a cared about The majority of management's employees in the Check Processing department.
I worked there 20 years ago.
Would go back now!
Competitive.
The work is not bad.
The good: They provide good training and good benefits.
I enjoyed helping my customers and recommending products that best fit my customers's needs.
Job work balance was good.
The bad: Very stressful.
Competitive to the point of cutthroat as bankers job is measured by bankers's metrics on how many products bankers sell in a quarter.
This creates a less than desirable work culture in which you have to watch your back at every turn.
"I had some of my work 'stolen' by a coworker and my manager assigned my leads to my manager, my manager was my senior."
Lunch is 30 minutes and you may have a 10 minute break if it's not too busy.
Lots of negativity and fake people.
HR sucks and will not help you if you place a complaint.
"Unfortunately, it was too much for me and I happily quit."
The job The job itself was a great experience.
"The people I worked with, not so much."
"Good health benefits, low wages, stressful."
Different Shifts.
Dose not provide life work balance.
And would prefer younger workers over experienced seasoned trained employees.
Don't appreciate the older workers and don't advance the older workers.
this bank - company to avoid.
run by out of touch people and completely run from india.
"Not interested in diversity, the find your own seat area is a horrible working conditions in the tech tower, the hostility is overwhelming."
Poor upper management .
"Company doesn't seem to look out for customers, more about selling and making money, Not what is best for the customer in front of you at the moment."
Make this place temporary.
If you need a stepping stone then this job is for you.
Each year the benefits are decreasing for the amount of work that you do.
"This company is a revolving door, therefore This company are always under-staffed at This company's call center."
If you work outside of their call center you are learning on your own and hope you get it right.
This company leave a lot of employees in the dark.
Interesting Experience .
I enjoyed my time at this bank.
"But, I was under a lot of pressure a lot of the time due to this bank's customer surveys.. if you got a bad review, you were made to feel pretty crummy about a bad review."
"Also, my regional manager was very intimidating."
"I do miss my days at this bank from time to time, but I'm glad to be gone."
Good opportunity to learn basic banking .
Working on the phones was stressful since it's not organized.
A lot of managers don't give you an opportunity to succeed.
Pay is good and always opportunity to work extra hours
A life of busy work.
A typical day at work: Log in.
Join MS Teams.
Engage in work/life related banter all day.
Each person handles Each person's assigned tasks.
Skype Meetings.
Log out.
Repeat the next day.
What you learned: * I learned that Midwest culture in the work place is very NOT diverse.
*
"When working remotely, the best way to feel like you are a part of the this bank family, is to go into a local branch and build relations with a local branch."
At least then you won't feel so apart.
"Management: Like anywhere, some are good, some are bad."
Probably the worse part is the deluge of paperwork and processes that change weekly.
Its like work for the sake of work.
"Whenever someone comes up with a procedure, they just make a new rule and even if a new rule impacts some other process, so what."
Overworked and Underpaid.
I strongly recommend not working on the retail end.
The sales goals are unreal and unrealistic and the pay out is terrible.
"You have to do so much selling and only to get a few hundred dollars of pay out, which is only quarterly."
"Most of the branches close at 6, so that means you work 8:30am-6pm most days."
"They also don't pay you anything, no matter the experience you have."
At most you will make $42K if you go into a branch as a banker
and you have to fight tooth and nail for that.
Turnover is extremely high.
"It's also hard to get days off, and don't even think about asking for a Friday or Monday off."
"It will be very hard to get, and they will give you the biggest guilt trip if you want either day off."
"Overall, unless you just really need a job, do not work at this bank on the retail side."
Productive!.
"Nice workplace, fun people, not stressful at all!"
"The work is easy, the people are fun and so are your clients most days."
"Like any job, you will have weird days with difficult ppl but overall, its decent!"
Laid back .
"Laid back, work from home."
Management is helpful.
Never a dull moment when speaking to customers in regards to customers's money.
Overall good company to work with.
Had a lot of issues while i was there .
"Never enough staff to handle clients, little help behind the teller line and management often only cared about sales goals."
My management would also consistently tell me 'I should just know things' without having to be told or informed how to do things.
Despite the fact that on the teller line management did not know how to do the functions either.
Overall a rough experience made harder by Covid-19.
A lot of work that needs to be done.. Stressful job.
"6 day work weeks 90% of the time, which means no work life balance."
Kids?
Oh well.
School?
Oh well.
Manager would write employees up for being 3 minutes late.
Manager would write you up for almost anything.
Unrealistic goal expectations.
Be prepared to be lectured every 5 mins about why you're not meeting your numbers.
Constant micromanagement and badgering.
"Benefits are really good, but that's about it."
Loved my co workers as well.
Management is a joke.
Don't expect to make any money unless you go above and beyond every quarter.
Great company .
I really enjoyed working for this bank.
If it wasn't for the fact that I was part time and ended up needing full time I would have stayed!
Really fun job though.
Great company.
They really care for the customers and employees.
They have great work life balance and makes sure you take your PTO.
During covid They really made sure the employees were safe and taken care of.
Poor and constant management turnover.
New regionals didn't even know the basic functions of the roles New regionals managed. .
Poor and constant management turnover.
New regionals didn't even know the basic functions of the roles New regionals managed.
Compensation plan consistently changed once goals were reached.
Percentage of pay taken for unexplained reasons with no recourse.
"Worst decision to work for this bank, hopefully only a regional problem but too large not to notice nationally."
"Don't try to suggest a process change or improvement, even if a process change or improvement only helps others."
They only want people to be robots and have no compassion for employees.
Keep you head in the sand and you will go far!!
Excellent.
"Great company, would recommend working here amazing awesome best place awesome amazing best place excellent best ever great people amazing best awesome"
Great Benefits .
"Great place to work, lots of opportunities for career advancement."
It does feel that upper management cares about upper management's employees and each year there are improvements made within company.
Productive workplace.
"Company has great benefits and pay, you must be a busy bee and make sure you are meeting goals and sales if you want to succeed."
Fun place to build clients relationships and room for growth
Fun work place.
"Good pay, I enjoyed my time at this bank, this bank was a bit micro managed at times ."
"I handled large volume of calls, flexible pto and great benefits."
I would recommend working at this bank
this bank try to come off as 'different' but this bank are just like ever other bank.
"Working for this bank is inconsistent , this bank treat some branches much better then others ."
For example the branches in more impoverished areas have far less technology and the branches aren't as kept up as the more wealthy areas.
Working for this bank is like working for any other bank.
this bank has this bank's ups and downs .
Your overall enjoyment while with this bank varies depending on the manager.
One of the major drawbacks for working for this bank is how this bank draw you in because of there status as one of the largest banks in the country but at the end of the day this bank pay like a small town credit union.
Most employees with children have to work part time jobs to make ends meet because this bank refuse to accommodate financially according to the times .
Just like any other major financial institution you can go from being the top of this bank in sales one month to literally getting fired the next.
"this bank are very strict on how this bank want things done , even if you have a different way that works for you this bank want things done 'there way'."
Overall this bank is a bunch of malarkey and filled with false promises .
this bank are just like every other bank .
Actually who am i kidding this bank are worse then other banks .
Others banks close between 4:30-5pm this bank decided to close at 6 pm but yet and still this bank post on the digital screens in branches about promoting a work to life balance .
How can you say you promote a work to life balance when I'm leaving my bank job at 6:45 at night.
Nothing Special.
Typical big corporation environment.
Nothing special.
Pay and benefits are average.
"Not a bad place to work, but not a great place either."
I always had the sense that there has to be something better out there.
Initial experience was positive; work culture and management style and support of employees changed 180 degrees in the 20+ years I worked there..
"A typical day at work is filled with stress, emphasis on productivity and statistics and a general lack of support for employees."
I learned quite a lot about financial services through my own accomplishments and desire to be learn.
"Management most recently was very unsupportive and exclusionary, especially with respect to individual employee special needs and medical conditions."
"Oftentimes, I found management to be disregarding, with a negative attitude regarding my experience and my advanced educational level (M.Ed.. + Ph.D. program ABD).at times, it seemed that jealously and a desire to be secretive regarding management's motives and actions was definitely part of the work culture."
"Openness of management is talked about, but not truly part of the work experience especially in recent years."
The most enjoyable part of the job was the (limited) ability to interact with other employees that became my friends and supports.
"The hardest part of the job was the negativity, unattainable productivity emphasis, lack of openness and truthfulness,and lack of support from the management team, particularly in the area where I worked prior to leaving my position."
this bank does not like to give raises to this bank's employees.  
this bank has amazing benefits and paid time off.
"However, don't get your heart set on raises of anything more than an extra $0.25/hr.this bank just want you to do more and more with no extra compensation."
Development.
I currently been in a bba position one year now and passed my yearly review on no corrective actions and I applied for a title I recently had before a bba position at another bank but her with this bank full time banker I passed the assessment and also talk to the recruiter about salary rate I am now on my fourth manager in a year and keep getting the run around for a bba position mind you
I have 2 years experience as a personal banker prior to the role im in now I applied two months ago had a interview with a manager who left within two months just had a 2nd interview with the manager now who been here a month and I keep getting told we have to pick the best fit for a bba position I keep getting talk to like I'm inexperienced mean while we lost four employees and I am currently taking on task that aren't in my role I'm not getting paid for task that aren't in my role vault custodian I have been a team player but for some reason I am being held back in advancement !
I feel I'm not valued here at this company or location I reach out to upper management with my concern and didn't get no help
Pay.
Bonuses based off of performance regardless of being out of work.
They aren't caring about employees but offer jobs to new people it's signing bonuses.
Being told sorry it's business sucks
stressful place to work for.
Maybe is just this branch in Pompano.
"Management is always late for work and we are late 5 minutes or less, we got warned."
"the morale of just this branch in Pompano is underground, no one is happy, everybody feels miserable."
Maybe is just the branch because just this branch in Pompano has fairly good benefits.
It could be worse .
Pay and benefit are good.
Very short staffed.
They pay well it is a very busy branch.
Can be a fun place to work depends on the day.
I like some of the programs they have to get extra HSA money.
Good Work Life Balance.
Terrible Pay.
"Good place for work life balance, but pay is terrible."
Even if you move up to another job level if you are in the salary range you will just be doing more work for no more money.
A place to stay if you don't need a big raise or care about career advancement.
Ehhhhh.  
this bank is geared to micromanaging this bank's employees.
"If goals are not met, you are put on what this bank call 'PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT.'"
Think twice before applying.
Nice employees but very stressful job with no training to learn the job. .
Pay is not worth the stressNo training to learn the job help to learn.
Nice employees High expectations to meet incentiveLots of online virtual classes which is only training they give you they does not actually teach you how to do your job.
Branch Banker - Pressure Overload/Miserable.  
this bank loves to underpay & overwork you.
"Long hours (if you have family or doctor appointments, or other commitments - this bank are not privy to accommodating very much & if this bank do it's always an issue) -"
this bank preach work life balance but will be micro aggressive with you when you use your time.
"Workplace culture is toxic, managers are so stressed out & dump so much pressure onto employees & bankers & it makes for an overall miserable experience."
"Pay is horrid, only good if you're a single individual - not good for a living wage especially considering cost of living in NJ.Most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
Fun place to work but also depends on branch .
"Being a Universal Banker was a juggle for sure, I had positive influences around me but I feel like I fell in the cracks for sure."
Every day was different and stressful in Every day's own unique way.
Mortgage Loan Officer.
I worked for this bank for nearly 10 years.
My time at this bank was miserable.
Expectations changed regularly and goals were unattainable.
The only thing this bank executives truly care about is this bank executives's image.
Employees are treated like cattle and policies are abusive.
Stressful .
Very stressful and demanding place to work.
It does not matter how long you have been with the company.
the company have no loyalty to the company's employees.
Always under-staffed.
Usual Large Corporate IT Environment.
"Not about to bash this bank, as this bank pay me decently well"
and I work from home in rather stress-free position.
But it's not overly fulfilling work and often times I don't feel like we have a clear vision of what we're doing.
Seems like every few weeks/months we're jumping on the latest and greatest technology or idea.
"Also, it takes an act of God to get anything done."
So much red tape it's ridiculous.
"And, as a developer, I find it very hard to get my job done when the security measures on my laptop block me from accessing websites and running software I need to perform every day job task."
"Plus, this bank's commitment to left-wing politics and taking every opportunity to shove this bank's commitment to left-wing politics in my face is not super appealing to me."
Employees .
The group of employees I worked with were excellent.
The group of employees I worked with worked as a team to reach our goals.
Management was great in the branch I worked at.
Always pushed us to better ourselves.
When there was an issue we always worked together to work thru an issue or make everyone comfortable.
If employees were struggling they took the time to help you strive and found what you were strong at.
Worst job ever.
"I was a Business Banking Specialist, and worked here 4 years."
This was hands down the most stressful miserable job I've ever worked.
The customers were never the issue.
"It was the people you work with, the people you work with have no sense of employee appreciation, and the managers show favoritism to some, and bully the others."
Don't do it...
"PROS: PTO, sick days, personal day, health benefits, 401k match."
CONS:
Everything else.
"Terrible hours (in store location), under-staffed, no OT, overworked, unrealistic goals, clueless staff 95% of the time."
EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER.
Was a very good company to work for.
Excellent benefit package. .
I enjoyed each day coming to work.
I learned many things over the years.
The hardest part of the job was the constant customer facing duties with no help from the last manager.
the last manager chose to close the last manager's door and only do clerical work and did not help manage the customer flow or take any customer appointments.
"The previous manager, The previous manager was a team player and helped all The previous manager's employees manage customer flow open accounts whatever The previous manager needed to do."
The newer manager has now lost almost all the previous employees due to The newer manager's mismanagement and causing issues due to confidentiality with each employee.
The newer manager chooses to speak about one employee to another and keeps drama going instead of being a team manager The newer manager tears the team apart.
Not bad.
Stressful and always under pressure to hit numbers even when we are under-staffed.
"If you don't mind that, then its not such a bad place to work."
Raises and room for advancement after a year.
Worst place to work for….
"Unless you love selling credit cards and get pennies in exchange, don't apply to this company."
You can do better with your life.
"You will be pressured to sell, overworked and underpaid."
Great Corporate Job.
"Great company culture, management support is outstanding, great training program (paid), offer PT/FT options, opportunities to move up quickly within the company."
Green place to work for.
great company to work for and to be a part of.
"good culture, learn a lot and not of hard work."
all of your work will be seen at the end and you can see that it was useful.
Great job.
"This job comes with great training, great benefits, flexibility in scheduling, amazing paid vacation, health benefits, 401k matching, overall This job is wonderful!"
"I think I got pretty lucky with my manager, cant speak for all of them, but my manager has been great!"
It's a job.
I've been working at this bank for a year and a half and I will say they have very good benefits
but they're a few things that need work.
They claim you can advance after 6 months but that's not true because even if you're doing well with metric goals and you apply for another position and you accept another position then a day later you get an email that this bank went with someone else.
This has happened more than one occasion even with coworkers.
The systems are so slow.
Also the pay is very low for the verbal and emotional abuse you experience from customers daily.
I have a good manager that doesn't micromanage but a lot of managers do and stress goals
Excellent company to work for.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
"Lots of opportunities for growth, strong focus on career development."
The management team is great and gives you opportunity to grow and develop within this bank
Just an 'eh' place to work..
Decent benefits for a financial institution but benefits's really the only good.
"Management is so out of touch with reality and is very old school, job does not offer good work/life balance and still has the mentality of 'if you're not in an office then you're not doing work'."
Okay place to work .
If you aren't not meeting all of your goals be prepared to be talked to on the regular about it.
They say they care about you but in reality what they really care about most is your numbers.
If you don't have any a stressful job this is not the job for you.
You can never do enough. .
Notice a trend in all the reviews.
You can't ever do enough.
You are micromanaged at ever level.
OT is required and the norm.
If you take a day off you must make up the overtime unless you take off 5 consecutive days.
Upper management is completely disconnected.
Upper management's basically a white collar factory job
and they literally call Upper management production for a reason.
Lots of turnover and for good reasons!!
Typical job in Banking.
I learned a lot about banking.
They provided classes and many other educational tools to learn how to better do my job.
This was a good job that showed both the sales and service sides to banking.
Overworked and underpaid !! .
Stay away !!!
No work life balance AT ALL !
Upper management cares about sales and numbers and absolutely nothing else !
Micromanagement at its worse and for very low pay.
Don't work here..
I know of over ten people in my small little branch and the surrounding branches who left this bank to go work for KeyBank for good reason.
Advancement is almost impossible.
Management is TERRIBLE because the nepotism is blatant.
The anti-robbery practices of 'lobby engagement' are useless and customers DO NOT like someone coming at customers with an iPad when all customers want to do is see a teller or banker.
"Most of my time at my branch, we had either no manager, no teller lead, or a bad manager and a bad teller lead."
We were always under-staffed.
"Lunch breaks weren't guaranteed, but you also get in trouble for eating behind the counter."
"Who cares about your health, right?"
Anyone with any sort of management position is a snob and thinks Anyone with any sort of management position can talk down to you because Anyone with any sort of management position're slightly less underpaid to deal with all of this than you are.
Seriously don't work here.
Anyone with any sort of management position're gonna phase out tellers anyway.
"Great coworkers, not so great upper management ."
The culture is great at this bank.
"The pay not so much. Started off entry level, so low pay was expected."
"But as time went on and I exceeded my sales goals, the raises didn't come."
Then trying to move up to become an MLO or any other position was met with resistance.
No support.
They want to keep you in same role.
We work as a team and this bank works with this bank's employees to rpo.ote work/life balance..
I love working at this bank.
this bank HAVE BEEN VERY Accommodating to me.
I am a part time employee who had some heal the issues and HR worked with me to make sure I had the time I needed.
Okay company but bad job.
"I worked as a customer representative but when I applied I didn't know The job was for cold calling, The job didn't have cold calling in the description."
The job was collecting debt for this bank loans and The job's a pretty decent job if you have thick skin.
The customers are rude most of the time and treat you like you're not a person.
"Most managers are understanding of the situation, but collecting debt was just not something I could get into."
wasn't getting paid enough to be treated like trash on a daily basis.
Good and bad.
See the ratings.
Not really much to say that hasn't been already said.
I think there's a lot of good and bad and you have to decide on what you want is best for you.
Just an okay/good Retail Job.
"You must really like sales to enjoy this job, hard to move up in company unless you want to move to Pennsylvania or just want to become an assistant branch manager or branch manager."
"Overworked and under-staffed, but benefits for part timers are pretty nice."
"I work with a good strong team, we get along like family in the branch and my supervisor and manager are both so understanding and supportive and my supervisor and manager're honestly a big part of the reason I'm still there."
"this bank offers no help when this bank're short staffed due to vacations or illnesses, however, this bank're very quick to pull from the branch when it benefits someone else."
"this bank're considered full staff, but struggle completing required daily/ weekly/ monthly tasks because this bank're too busy."
"this bank're expected to get good surveys, but its hard when customers have to wait in line for long periods of time due to lack of staff and also because this bank expects this bank to push sales and not rush to get the lines down."
"Loyalty to this bank means nothing, doesn't matter how long you've been with this bank, the new people coming in end up making the same as you or more"
"Good benefits package, supportive management at branch."
"As a teller, you are expected to be able to process many complicated transactions while adhering to policies and procedures to minimize risk."
That's the easy part.
What's hard is the pace.
"The work is essentially non-stop, and you are constantly being pushed to make referrals to bankers and other internal partners to make sales."
Teller.
I love this bank but the place I was working for made feel less of a person this bank tried to change the way I dressed the way my hair look this bank tried to buy me clothes I felt so ashamed of my self Into the point I felt like I was not enough and not liked in this bank
Friendly staff.
"under-staffed in the smaller branches puts a strain on tellers, and also results in low customers surveys due to long wait times, which doesn't make management happy"
Terrible leadership and Terrible leadership comes from the top down..
You absolutely will not get your loans closed.
(On the secondary platform).
The only loans you are able to get done are through retail.
(HELOCs etc) Commission is terrible and you get penalized for everything.
Processing and closing departments are the worst.
Work hard and be rewarded with team ventures for fun like bowling.
My day was always busy and steady.
I would take my breaks and lunch but stay on site most of the time.
Once in a while as team we would go out for lunch as staff.
Great resume starter. .
Great for young people wanting to put young people wanting to put their foot in the financial industry's door's foot in the financial industry's door.
"Work-home life balance is excellent, and many paid days off if you're full time."
Great benefits but very stressful.
Expect to work 6 days a week.
Lunch breaks get cut short due to staffing issues.
No work-life balance.
Being micro-managed all the time.
You'll have your manager on your ear pushing you to sell a credit card while talking to a customer over the phone
this bank is a good company to work for.
I worked in the First Side center mail room.
I enjoyed delivering the mail most day.
Compensation was decent for what the job was.
The advancement within this bank could be better but The advancement within the company makes sense as it is.
Good company to work.
"good benefits, and people."
"If you are asking about compensation/salary, I think they pay depending on your ability."
(at least for sales position)
.
"very flexible, and MY manager is awesome, but idk about others."
I think it is a great company for women.
Pay is decent but never get raises!.
I have been a Teller for 4 Year and was making pennies more than a new hire coming in.
Had to threaten to leave to another establishment to get a $0.50 raise.
And getting help is like pulling teeth.
Good Pay - High Sales Pressure.  
"this bank pays well, especially for someone with only a high school degree."
"My career lasted for 8 years, started as a part time teller and ended as a Service and Sales Rep, towards the end of my time, cold calling 100 min. people a week was the rule in order to make sales appointments."
"High Stress in sales as I'm sure it is at any bank, service was the best part of the job, you really are able to help people reach goals and that feels good."
"Lots of room for advancement, many co workers moved on to higher titles, 2 weeks paid vacation, 6 paid sick days, and paid holidays."
Branch management was great but it really just depends on the type of person you have as manager.
Great Culture and Benefits.
Have worked many positions and had great mentors along the way.
this bank is a well run organization and aren't afraid to try something new.
Expanding nationally and well positioned.
Work environment has been enjoyable and teams work well together.
All depends on the branch.
My branch was okay.
My coworkers were amazing and my manager genuinely cared.
It's all upper management.
Corporate doesn't care about you.
Pay could be a lot better considering how much you have to put up with.
Customers can be very very rude.
Expected to meet a call per day and sales quota when they under-staff every branch.
Great job if you're okay with small yearly pay increases and small quarterly bonuses if you can sell.
"Benefit package is actually impressive with a company match 401K, pension, and investment account."
Modern day slave labor .
The pay is terrible and with The pay they expect you to kill you're self daily to keep up with the numbers also there is mandatory overtime on weeks when there is a holiday but you where already off a day weeks when there is a holiday so you are forced to stay and make your hourly rate.
Straight forward job duties.
Unreasonable checking account and loan goals.
Every year diminishing compensation for all compensation (checking savings loans investments merchant services and advisor referrals both consumer and business).
They took a lot away from financial sales people.
Took away ability for the position to deal with affluent customers even if the customer still wanted to deal with us the customer were not allowed to bc the customer had a single person the customer wanted to handle the customer.
High turnover rates high stress because of unreasonable goals.
AML Operations is a no.
"AML roles at this bank have such potential, but consistently grinding employees into the ground with overtime (no extra pay given) and unrealistic goals has made the work environment unbearable."
High stress.
Banking is a very stressful job.
Cold calls are the worst.
You are required to do a lot.
They are increasing banker numbers so bonuses will be even harder to earn.
I'm sure that's on purpose.
"bad management, inconsistency, ."
this department basically went down hill after new management and got worse when COVID happened.
favoritism at its finest! inconsistency & DRAMA.
supervisors and upper management only cared about supervisors and upper management!!
job would be excellent for entry level into the work industry or someone who have a few years left to retire.
no advancement & don't go into the job thinking them people is your friend!
Ok if you don't mind back to back calls.
On the phone all day.
Sometimes management was t the greatest.
management often refused escalation calls and we were forced to deal with upset people.
Pay was decent.
Underpaid and overworked.
"You will not be compensated equally, you will be overworked, and stressed over sales push!"
It is not a service industry but a total sales environment.
You have to make cold calls to people and you will feel like you work in a call center.
Staffing is a big issue regularly and that should tell you a lot.
Benefits are at an average level.
I could not take it any longer and had to quit due to covid.
Management is not organized or helpful.
My branch manager is an AMAZING manager.
Regional manager is TERRIBLE.
Management never wants to hire anyone.
Management push you off until the last minute.
Management will say anything to shut you up.
Management give you 2-3 weeks paid vacation that you can never use because Management won't find anyone to cover you to leave.
"Management preach that you should help the customer, but are only concerned about number."
The pay and your coworkers are the only thing that make you stay.
Its just not worth it anymore.
Ok place .
Pay is good.
But the way they micromanage your every move is disappointing .
Certain sense of being better then others by a few in upper management.
Training isn't enough.
This company genuinely appreciate there employees .
I was let go from my previous job due to COVID.
BUT where doors CLOSE others open.
this job is THE BEST JOB I HAVE EVER HAD.
I LOVE this bank I would recommend this job to everyone.
Good .
It's very comfortable and they work with you.
Benefits are good.
Started as a part timer but was offered full-time within the first three days.
Good point
"Overall, great company."
"Great company, always room to grow your career."
Management has always treated me with respect.
this bank has great health benefits and additional perks and benefits with other companies.
Not great .
The training for this job wasn't good at all.
Almost two years later and I don't know everything.
They are starting to nit pick about everything these days.
Pay is too low for what we have to deal with daily.
Poor Work Life Balance.
Poor training and work life balance.
"Direct management is great, but Sr. Management expects the impossible."
"Systems are out of date and many glitches, bugs."
Good Work Life Balance.  
Good Work Life Balance is a decent place to work.
There are many people who have been there for years and it can occasionally be difficult to drive change.
The effectiveness of management and your personal career development are dependent on your department.
Okay company .
It's a lot of different things that's could be better within the company.
It's like any other job you gone have the good and the bad.
The thing is just learn while your here and better your everyday work skills.
Be true to yourself and customers so that you can be the best you.
Good work life balance .
Good company to work for good work life balance.
Management listens to your opinions.
Great benefits just would like more opportunity to more up within my career passion.
Great pay but unethical company.
I personally would not recommend working in the Birmingham area.
"The management is awful, the training is ever lasting and who would extend hours during a pandemic?"
They will reel you and spit you back out as fast as you came in.
I did not feel welcomed at all upon employment with this company.
I would generally go to work depressed and leave depressed.
"Please do not expect to make friends, everyone is for themselves."
Fun place to work .
Loved my team and Customs.
It was easy to work as I had a great team and I loved my customer's.
Plus it was close to my home.
Which made it good for me
Great for those starting a career.
As a branch operations specialist at a universal branch it was a pain.
My manager often did not want to assist with anything
so I was mainly running a universal branch.
I was working long days and often received overtime.
The compensation wasn't worth it
Good People.
Huge Company that sometimes has a small company feel due to the great people.
Great place to grow a career at the lower levels.
The bureaucracy and never-ending meetings to get things done can sometimes be frustrating.
Alright.
Work life balance sucks pay is alright but should get paid more.
The managers are alright.
The company needs to give everyone a shot at moving into a position they want.
Low Motivation.
Depends highly on the location you are in but if in a low traffic branch the days will drag on and much of the enjoyment of the job is from relationships with coworkers
"Great hours, great pay. ."
I am more of an on my own employee.
"I hit every goal, every time, but was very overlooked."
I felt mistreated but kept it to myself.
"All in all, have thick skin and it's a great job."
Smoke & Mirrors .
My experience may be a bit different because I started during a pandemic and was treated fairly but the circumstances set me up for failure in the long run.
I didn't have the best management but my team was amazing.
"Once the branch fell below the branch's little red line, you really started to see you were a number, a worker bee (nicely putting it)."
"Management would become intentionally intimidating and even threatening, implying our jobs were at stake."
The morale of my particular branch became so intense and toxic that myself and two others (out of 4 bankers) left.
The hours at my location were 8-6 and Saturday's 9-2 and it made my work life balance almost unbearable.
My time there was definitely rewarding as far as what I learned and will be able to build from but extremely difficult and hard to please upper management.
upper management will run you ragged and expect the impossible all while putting on a smile wondering why you feel the way you do.
This is a great position for someone starting out
but I would do my time and go.
this bank sells you sunshine and rainbows only to give you extreme stress and expectations that are almost impossible for even the most experienced banker to achieve.
"Pay was decent, hours are not good if you are looking for work life and family balance."
My team of coworkers were the best but management definitely needs a ton of work.
Productive and fun workplace .
Laid back job with good compensation.
Easy to balance work and family.
Management was great and understanding.
Hours were decent.
Easy to get time off
Poor management .
"Poor management, years of service does not mean anything, you are just a number."
Branch was not adequately staffed.
"You may be the only one on teller line working, no one else even in the lobby."
"Very unsafe management would take 2 - 3 hours for lunch to get nails done, pedicure, teeth whitened, or hair done."
No structure.
Stay away from AML Dept.
No work life balance.
"Sr. management is doing a terrible job of getting a handle on the workflow, retaining talented, productive workers who are producing quality work."
Complaints to HR are a waste of time.
Very little chance of career advancement unless you are located near the Pittsburgh headquarters.
"Other departments might be better, but I'm only referring to AML Dept.. Goals are very difficult to achieve as the bar is set so high."
Very little to no praise for doing good work.
Management doesn't take an interest in your personal well being.
No camaraderie among team or should I say there are cliques.
It's ok .
It's an ok place to work.
There is room for growth.
The hours are not to great.
It's a mixed culture.
Working downtown can be expensive because of parking
Great company.
Some politics.. Love the company.
Middle managers not so much.
"Great benefits, top management tries hard to do the right thing."
A lot of middle managers leave a lot to be desired.
Love it.
"9 years, love my coworkers and job."
Very team oriented and treats employees well.
Great benefits and time off.
Love my bankers hours and holidays!!!!
Teller.
Wonderful place to work!
Great benefits and pay.
Team friendly environment.
Witnessed many people advance from the teller position.
Sales goals are high is the only drawback.
Not All Bad.
It's a decent place to work to get your foot in the door to the financial world.
Typical corporate bank that has heavy sales goals.
"They have decided to close my branch and have no place for me to go, so I was forced to resign"
Decent learning environment and stepping stone.  
"this bank Business Credit was a fun group of young professionals particularly in the Field Exam group, but isn't a career that you'd want to remain in for very long (as many people try to advance after a year or two)."
Be Careful About Working Here.
"Overall, a stressful company to work for."
"this bank have an inclusive corporate company culture, however an inclusive corporate company culture does not necessarily translate at the local level sometimes."
"this bank has good retirement benefits, 401k and pension are matched, but that's it pretty much aside from that."
"High deductible healthcare plan, aggressive sales tactics."
"If you are not making enough in sales, this bank push you to do more."
"If you make this bank's requested numbers in sales, this bank push you to do double."
When
No real advancement opportunities..
"The harder you work and the more you succeed, the more the company want to keep you where you are for the same pay rate."
It's universal throughout the company.
If you don't go into the company's weird management training program out of college you have no real shot at advancement here.
"Coming from a top performer in the Consumer Loans department for 4 years I can tell you, the ceiling is definitely not glass."
Where the company hire you is where the company want to keep you.
"If that doesn't work for you, well, you're more than expendable to the company."
Interesting Workplace.
The Benefits are great.
The Benefits barely give raises.
Tellers are forced to make sales but don't get compensation for sales.
Instead Tellers add compensation for the sales to your salary.
Decent.
I was with the company for a long time.
From the beginning to the end was a dramatic change.
When I started there was a great work life balance and you only worked 5 days a week with regular Saturdays off.
"At the end you worked every day, but Sunday and getting a Saturday off it was very difficult."
You also had to schedule all vacation and PTO in January.
"So if you needed a last minute doctor appointment, or family conflict later in the year, you had to request to move your days around."
"Which, might not be approved if someone else requested it off."
"There was very little room for advancement, even with a decent turn over."
Upper management expects tip-top sales.
You need to be at the utmost top of the list and you need to harass customers constantly for more sales.
You're expected to make a product recommendation to every customer every time.
"This wouldn't be so bad, except the same customers come in all the time."
"Eventually, the same customers get really frustrated and annoyed and stop coming in."
"Then, you're expected to make sales calls and stay late to call customers and ask customers to come in for appointments, even to the point of harassment."
"A system generated list appears and you must contact everyone on A system generated list, even you just called everyone on the list two weeks ago."
Decent Job.
Its working a bank.
"lots of customer service, so if thats your thing, then this is the job for you."
the other thing you may not be told or realize is a bank requires you to be a salesperson.
"a bank will play it off like a bank are helping customers, but a bank just reward people who churn out numbers."
"credit cards, loans."
The idea is to get as many as possible.
"if you don't meet your goals because your clientele is declined repeatedly or can't afford loans and credit card debt, it isn't taken into consideration."
Just the results are.
a bank is a good company to work for.
fantastic benefits.
just very sales oriented and that isn't stressed during the hiring process.
Not a lot of advancement.
Although there are plenty of opportunities within the company it is harder for some positions to move up without starting all over with some positions base pay.
If you need a manager for a customer forget it.
a manager for a customer are very busy all the time you would most likely have to let a manager for a customer know a manager for a customer will receive a call back.
Makes unhappy customers even more frustrated.
inclusive work environment with supportive management.  
"this bank is all about work, life, balance."
this bank value your work ethic and challenge you to do better everyday
so you can advance and achieve your goals.
this bank offer competitive pay rates and a great benefits package including 401k matching and generous PTO with paid holidays.
"With that being said, this bank do expect you to earn those benefits."
"There are sales goals to meet and sales goals to meet can be challenging with the other tasks you are expected to complete throughout the day (Such as answering the phone, balancing a drawer, holding appointments, & various office tasks)."
Ensuring the customer's financial wellbeing is sound is this bank's main focus and some customers do not wish to listen when you offer the advice or product.
Must be able to take the criticism that customers may give in a professional manner.
Great work/life balance but the pay isn't the greatest.
Great company to work for.
Great department and team members but Great department and team members pay is not the greatest.
Worked for the company for over 5 years and embarrassed to say how much I made annually.
Great benefits and work from home opportunities which is always great.
The CEO is great and the company try to maintain an inclusive culture.
Management in my department was great
but I can't speak for other departments.
It just comes down to the pay which really sucks (at least for my department).
"Oh, the company also offer tuition reimbursement and training/certifications such as six sigma which you can take with you if you ever leave."
Depends on your manager.
"Depends on your manager, but not all bad."
I hated the push sales culture.if you like sales sales's the place for you.
If you don't than you should move on.
Low pay.
Low pay for a lot of work that they want you to do and getting promoted is super hard.
You have to kiss a lot of behinds to even be considered not hired
not a good place to work.
not a fun place to work at.
bad management.
superiors do not care about you at all.
Can't wait to get out at this point.
"Limited opportunity to change departments and even if you do, it takes months to complete the process."
"While waiting to move, you'll likely be burned out"
this job was a job.
"It's an ok company, very difficult to advance within."
The pay is average but you are micromanaged everyday on this job and treated like you are in high school.
AML full of aggressively mediocre racists.
"No matter how well you perform, if mgt doesn't like you, mgt will 'manage you out of this bank' as management calls it."
"During Black History Month 2019, received an email for an improvement meeting titled Make AML Great Again."
I think an email for an improvement meeting titled Make
AML Great Again says it all.
Horrible Place To Work.
Management will not back operations.
Loan Officers have senior management wrapped around Loan Officers's fingers.
Don't waste your time or experience with this company.
Work.
Great opportunity enjoy the work here..
a lot of growth opportunities and like he's passing up good call center jobs where he can work from home making 14 or 15 for this job
Average.
"If you like talking to people and helping reset people's passwords, or get fees reward by all means apply for this company."
But if you do not like talking to people that are not willing to help people that are not willing to help themselves you will not like this jobs.
Good customer service experience .
"Overall it was a good customer service experience, but it is still retail."
Location of the branch may vary the reviews.
"Location I was at was often very busy, half the customers were rude, and some of my coworkers would openly talk about politics and talk negatively about social issues in the workplace which I always found to be unprofessional and uncomfortable."
"At the same time, coworkers were helpful and knowledgeable."
Training team was nice and manager did all manager could to help me progress.
"If you don't want to stay in retail or customer service, stay away."
"Time off worked on a seniority basis, didn't matter if you put Time off in months ahead."
"If someone who's worked at the location longer than you, someone who's worked at the location longer than you get to choose PTO before you."
Have to work weekends.
this bank was amazing with COVID pay on the other hand.
"Productive, Fun depends on your TL, Busy ."
I do not feel the same about this bank.
As I use to.
1
"The biggest reason is *No Merit Increase* you want to work a person in three different departments, and No increase."
"You can do that to others, that may say *"
Well okay I will accept that* but others will not accept it.
"I have been through a couple of Acquisitions, with former companies, and my pay actually went up!"
Not stay the same!
"No, at this bank."
This year there is no pay increase* seems it fell right in line with the Acquisition that just happened.
2. I was on a Team that had no morale.
"Some had no drive to want to have fun, the TL did not push fun, was dry, and really did not do much."
"Was behind the scenes hiding, only gave recognition to whom the TL knew the longest."
"Some Agents had terrible attitudes, but this could have came from the energy from the TL."
3
"The OLD systems we work off of are horrible, too many steps to do anything, this bank took too long to get innovative with this bank's systems *and you have ridiculous Merits to meet* QA is not consistent, some TL's's you have to pull teeth to get some TL's to dispute a SET score, some TL's do not acknowledge each Agent for good work."
4. I did not want to go by the career reviews for this bank.
But the career reviews for this bank sure were true.
"It also seems like greed toke over, and after the Acquisition that just happened *it was we have to think about this bank pockets."
* 5.
Some Agents be like *At least you have a job* as if this bank is the only place to work.
I enjoy The work for this bank. .  
this bank is very flexible and works with me when needing time off.
The work is easy and rewarding..I meet new people everyday..
I am paid well for my job duties.
Great place to work and retire.
I love everything about my job.
I know exactly how I effect our clients and what role I play within our position.
"There are times where the team can get so busy that no one can assist you, but you have a nice window to complete your work."
"Great pay, great benefits."
Great pay is great and great benefits are a definite plus.
"Fast pace environment, room for growth."
Paid time off.
Great Job.
I really enjoyed working for this bank!
this bank's a great company and this bank's job work/Life balance is AWESOME.
I recommend you work for this bank and make it a Career.
Support and Resources.
"High call volume, helping customers with customers's financial inquiries and technical issues with this bank's app and website."
Management is friendly and supportive.
"Workplace culture was good, everyone seems to be friendly and willing to help each other."
"The hardest part of the job was making customers happy when customers are calling about fees, overdrafts, and disputes."
The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy after you've helped solved customers's issue.
Good company.  
this bank is a good company to work for.
I get paid well and have never had any true issues.
Make sure you are open to coaching because this bank really do love to coach people.
Overall good.
I previously worked in banking and loved banking but this was totally different working from home.
I felt like it was way too much information for you to know.
They had recently took away tier 1 and tier 2 call handling and made it just us that knows all the information and it was tough.
The pay was good but the amount of information was too much.
It was ok but my anxiety flared up.
Customer service dept was great.
"Once you get transferred to online banking, its terrible."
"The phone calls, the quota etc."
Bonuses were nice!
My 3rd supervisor was nice.
Decent Place to work.
"This isn't a bad place to work, I Had a horrible manager that ruined everything for me, but the pay was good and they care about their employees."
"I didn't like that I had to do sales as a teller, made me not want to do the job anymore."
Productive environment with managers who respect thoughtfully crafted new ideas.  
"this bank has a strong culture of recognizing innovation, and being a listening ear to new ideas."
"In my experience, especially early in my career, as long a new idea was carefully thought out, a new idea would be listened to and potentially implemented."
Great benefits .
Love all the benefits this bank has to offer from the health care benefits to PTO.
Only thing I can say is working at the call center is mentally taxing and my hours aren't super great for family life.
Most of your coworkers are good people and very knowledgeable.
Good place to start a career.
You will have to move on though as Most of your coworkers do not compensate well.
Upper management will tell you in order to get a raise you need a job offer for Upper management to match.
a job offer for them to match will however be the biggest and possibly the only raise you get.
Upper management like to say they have great benefits
but they are comparable and usually less than what's offered at other banks.
Only concerned about the bottom line.
Employees are drones..
No chance of advancement if you aren't a minority.
The culture is so 'inclusive' that there is no equal opportunity.
Management is only interested in how much money you can turn.
Customer service is based on what the customer has for investment.
"High Stress, Low Pay."
There is not a good work-life balance at this bank.
I am constantly working through lunch breaks and past my scheduled shift.
The workload and responsibilities of this role are not compensated on a fair basis.
You will be expected to take on an excessive amount of work with little to no training.
"I have constantly been lied to regarding raises, workload, and career progression throughout my time with this bank."
Managers are scheduled in meetings all day and are not supportive.
"Upper management has no idea what is actually going on for front-line employees, yet Upper management are the ones that dictate the processes and systems we use."
There is also a large disconnect among different internal departments with no departments wanting to claim ownership for work and other issues.
This ultimately will fall back on my role to take care because we have the most contact with the customers.
"This requires us to work on issues and research solutions that we don't have the tools for, all on top of our normal workload."
You will find yourself working well outside of the job description with little to no extra incentives with this bank.
"Fully expect to be lied to regarding pay progression, career progression, and workload when working for this bank."
If you absolutely need a job it's fine but don't work more than the bare minimum and don't plan on making a career here.
Good company to work for.
Depending on what position you are in..  this bank as a company is good to work for.
Be careful which position you chose.
"If your position involves sales be prepared for an overview of every move you make, Lots of cold calls (this bank as a company don't consider cold calls cold calling since this bank as a company are clients but trust me this bank as a company don't want cold calls), and meetings everyday cutting into the time you need to make cold calls."
Very Hostile Job Environment.
This is not a good place to work.
this bank Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to the managers.
"If a manager feels threatened, a manager will do everything a manager can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group."
a manager claim a manager provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen.
The amount this bank raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year.
"So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases."
"There are plenty more Financial Service Companies out there, I suggest you look somewhere else."
Great environment .
"Wonderful benefits, one job I wish I was still at but the schedule was unrealistic for me at the time."
"B2B calls,metrics and all but room for growth,mgr helpful"
Back to back phone calls and crunched on time.
"While the pay and benefits are decent and there is paid time off, the job the job itself is quite stressful with panicked and stressed out customers calling in, often with complex banking issues."
"Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and management treat you like a customer."
"When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time."
"You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete paperwork and notes on customer accounts with the customer on the line."
"You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do."
Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet Co-workers from other departments's own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another.
"There are many positive aspects to the job itself including benefits and the way you can call in sick or schedule vacation is very independent, you don't need to tell your boss any personal details, just that you won't be in."
You just call the call off line.
"The sent beautiful flowers to my brothers funeral when I had to call in to attend my brothers funeral, which was incredibly caring."
"There are a lot of resources for a wide range of things, as long as you know where to look."
"Don't bother asking management though, management'll tell you to call HR and treat you like another customer. "
- more...
Great culture.  
this bank has a great company culture.
"There is a good work life balance when compared to competitors, but that does mean the pay is less competitive."
I enjoy working with my team and networking with other lines of business within this bank.
"If pay would be better aligned with performance, I would be completely satisfied."
Good management good benefits .
I felt overworked there for such little pay!
You would take about 70-90 calls a day and the breaks would be so short.
the job as a whole is an extremely stressful job.
The health benefits was nice and my manager was nice but the job as a whole I wouldn't work there again.
Okay.
My experience has been stifled by the pandemic and underdeveloped leadership at my particular branch.
"Overall, my particular branch's a great company my particular branch."
I really feel as if my particular branch care as much as my particular branch can.
No work/life balance.
"They are not family friendly at all, longer hours for branches means less time at home with your family, upper management cares more about money and how money will negatively impact the customers than how money will affect the employees."
Tough job.
Tough job is very difficult and stressful.
Not for the faint of heart.
Hardest part of Tough job is the customers and the number of phone calls.
Would not recommend this place
Inclusive Work Environment.
"Excellent and supportive trainers but not much support is offered after training - they have support departments, but support departments're not very helpful and mostly difficult to reach."
When reaching out to Retail Support Retail Support forward an article for you to find your solution (which you're already required to do prior to contacting Retail Support).
"Basically, you learn more as you go...on your own."
The pay is decent and time off benefits are good.
Youth focused.
Experienced employees were marginalized and subtly forced out of the work environment Purposely removed from emails and meeting invitations.
Loss of job was mentioned at least once a month
Great company.  
this bank makes you truly feel welcomed in your career.
Excellent trying and benefits.
Raises every 6 months as well as the potential to earn bonuses which is great
Headed in right direction.
"But expect Ohio salary, regardless of where you live."
"I would recommend this bank because from management down to the line, you can tell this bank cares about people."
"However, this bank are a bank."
Nickel-and-dime is what this bank do best.
And salaries are no exception.
"Although I was able to negotiate a salary commensurate with where I live, I was never able to get a salary raise as the base salary for a big metro area like NYC or DC is far higher than the top earners in the Cleveland, Ohio/Pittsburgh PA market, where most of staff are based."
The politics and diversity (lack there of) mimics the state of the nation.
Expect nothing different there.
The one thing I can say is that women are empowered at this bank and women are very much in leadership positions every where you look.
Some areas adopt change and are forward thinking and adapt modern practices.
Other areas or groups are stuck in mimicking older banks.
There are enough of those pockets of teams that really slow down progress.
Productive and fun workplace..
"Best part of job was interacting with clients, team members and management at a world class level, thanks to the trainers and all other support provided."
"Good company, hard job."
Decent pay and good benefits.
"Lots of angry customers, most of Lots of angry customers you can't help."
"Management is good, and tries to be supportive but the organization is too big and the departments don't cooperate with each other."
Be prepared to talk non-stop for 8 hours.
I really feel proud to work at this bank.
Working at this bank is a great decision.
Amazing benefits.
Great 401 options.
All the workers are great.
All the workers push sale a lot.
When All the workers close a branch All the workers are very unprofessional.
You are left wondering what is going to happen up until the end.
If you work at this bank apply for a busy branch or plan on not being with this bank long.
Decent benefits.
Where the incompetent and politically savvy succeed.
They do offer decent benefits and benefit access platforms.
Heard raises and bonuses were sub-par.
Discretionary performance rewards and charitable giving lackluster.
Outdated and bare-bones workplace technology due to ultra conservative risk-averse.
"The way employees go out of there way to educate co-workers on procedures, and policies. ."
Great company to work for.
"Excellent service standards, and a 'Can do' attitude."
"No question ever goes unanswered, and our employees always offer clarity and peace of mind for our clients"
Good support from all Managers to be productive and fun workplace with the team ethic..
Good support from all Managers to be productive and fun workplace with the team ethic.
No sufficient specifications on the mainframe area oldest employees expecting miracles from new employees trying to make you feel bad instead giving you support to be more efficient and productive.
this bank Need people to give oldest employees what oldest employees are missing in the mainframe world.
Not too many people has mainframe experiences.
Typical day.
Working at this bank can be a very rewarding but very stressful.
I strongly believe each persons experience with this bank will depend on management and team dynamics in the branch.
There are always more tasks to complete than there are hours in a day so teamwork is essential to stay on pace.
Change is the only constant.
They have a lot going on.
Hard to keep up with all the changes.
They are trying to be forward thinking but not everyone is on the same page.
They need to work on getting something right before moving on to the next change and involve the right people in the design and decision processes.
Good place .
"Good place to work, easy to get the job if you know someone that works there."
Pay is good and benefits are good too.
The hours suck but it's good and steady money.
Do Not Work Here .
Only lasted 2 months at this location before I was let go this was by far the most sales heavy job I've ever worked.
They expect you to make a sale with every customer that comes in and you are cold calling customers during your down time that want nothing to do with you.
Training was awful as instructors never actually showed you how to do anything.
We were also consistently under-staffed during my time there so we always worked six days a week.
You are consistently micromanaged by your manager and after every customer you are criticized for not making a sale and instead of coaching and training your manager would just tell me what I did wrong and would consistently talk bad behind employees backs.
this location is by far the worst place I've ever worked and I would highly recommend staying away.
Best bank I have worked at .
the bank is really an excellent bank to work for.
Extremely supportive at every aspect - employees are encouraged to grow and this is backed by a very structured development programs that relates to the different positions within the bank.
Amazing Diversity & Inclusion program as well with local and national EBRG chapters in addition to regional councils to ensure the bank's activities within the bank's communities are perfectly in line with the bank's values as an organization.
The leadership truly believes in improving financial literacy and demonstrates it through many philanthropic efforts across the US.
"During the pandemic, while every bank was reducing cost, the bank invested by creating an entire division within the commercial bank dedicated to organizational financial wellness."
Base pay I would say is very fair and bonuses have both a set and discretionary component.
"Very good health plan benefits with HSA, 401k and Pension."
"Overall, the bank is the best bank I've worked for and I plan to be here until I retire."
Not good.
"Not good, sakes, not valued, need improvement, doesn't care about employees, care only about the money, make you perform more than one job function and"
Meet great people.
8 years.
But happy I left.
Traveling downtown is to much.
Let people work from home.
Management can be strange.
Moving up became difficult.
Recruiters are to involved with decision making.
Fake work life balance.
This place promotes work life balance but doesn't actually allow employees to have a life outside of work.
Management expects employees to work almost every weekend and most nights.
"Also, it is impossible to get any actual work done because meetings are scheduled throughout the entire day."
"So if you want to get any real work done, you have to work after hours."
Management does not trust Management's employees' knowledge and Management consistently does the opposite of what is recommended.
Compensation and Culture are low..
Visit onsites and promote this banks products.
Open accounts onsite outside of branches.
You must have a good team leader if you want to enjoy this role.
Management attributed to a very toxic 'team' environment.
"Often inciting competition, gossip and slander as a form of 'motivation' and influence."
"I went on medical leave and when I came back, my position was The decision by my direct manager to a floater position where I had to drive 2 hours to get to any onsites."
Spoke to HR and nothing could be done.
The decision did not make success in my role conducive since most of my time was spent driving.
"My advice when working here: Don't get sick, don't seek surgery to get well or you may not have your position to come back to."
"Also, this role is a dead end role even if you are a rock star with your goals."
Many of my team members have been in this role for years (as much as 13 years) and have not gotten promoted or considered.
Outsiders were hired and promotion from within non-existent.
The pay was certainly not worth the headaches.
"Productive, lots of room for advancement, stressful frontline roles."
"Just like most call centers, the frontline position can be pretty stressful with back to back calls which was the hardest part of my job along with the metric goals that were expected to be met every month while maintaining high scoring quality evaluations."
"Personally, the quality of my customer interactions took priority over my own metrics, which became a topic of conversation during personal coaching meetings."
"However, my experience with this bank as a company, was very positive."
"The environment was always supportive, inclusive, and motivating."
"There were many resources available to all employees within the call center such as resume workshops, public speaking and leadership groups, and career corner opportunities (where you can learn more about other careers within the call center)."
"this bank as a company also had a comprehensive benefits package (including health/life/vision/dental insurance, 14 days of PTO given each calendar year, occasional VTO offered, up to 6 paid sick days, HSA, ISP 401k, FMLA, pension plan, home buying assistance, employee specific APRs on credit cards/loans, separate rooms within call center for nursing mothers, etc.)."
"Overall, this bank as a company is a great company to work for, but the frontline position specifically was not for me."
Poor Management.
Branch manager I worked for was awful.
"Branch manager I worked for had zero banking experience, not a basic understanding of banking regulations."
"this bank hires people based on having a degree only, no experience needed to run a $36 million deposit base branch."
Great work environment .
I enjoy my job.
"My customers, coworkers and managers are great."
The day can be slow sometimes.
Pay could be better.
Benefits are great.
Room for advancement.
Unreasonable Expectations.
It was a stressful Job.
"Expectations were hard to meet, with the volume of phone calls."
Team Leaders weren't always helpful with difficult customers.
Great customers and employees where i worked.
No work life balance.
All about goals.
Very stressful and disappointing.
Management has no clue about branch banking....
just producing.
I love my customers.
my customers trust me and I do what's best for my customers...
but it's never enough.
Pretty good for a Bank.
"My time here was very good but in the end the pay wasn't worth it, the benefits were terrible and management didn't want to deal with customers."
Work life balance is great though.
A good stepping stone.
It's a good company to get your feet wet in banking.
The pay is not very good.
But the time off is great.
3 weeks when you start.
There's not a lot of communication between upper management to employees.
That's pretty much the same in most departments I've worked in.
My coworkers are fantastic and I love My coworkers.
Nice environment.
Nice environment but sometime the things they required us to do was overkill.
The different departments need to work together better.
Management was good for the most part
Okay pleas to work.
Been there 5 years.
Can't wait to get out at this point.
"Limited opportunity to change departments and even if you do, it takes months to complete the process."
"While waiting to move, you'll likely be burned oir"
It could be as good or as bad as the branch you work at.  
"this bank can be EXTREMELY toxic or very, very good; depending on your branch and 'leaders'."
"this bank is VERY sales-driven, and there is not necessarily room to grow a career."
"this bank don't pay enough for all the work this bank require from you, customers can be very moody/rude."
"High turnover rate, and extremely under-staffed branches."
"Most of the time you have so much work, that you will leave something 'hanging', and most likely will be called out for it."
God forbid a customer leaves a bad review.
"It's gonna hurt you and the branch, so it adds an additional layer of stress."
I would not recommend working at this bank to my worst enemy..  
"this bank has the layoff off over half of this bank's workforce, including full time employees, completely without warning."
"this bank also gave no separation package at all, and cut benefits the day after the layoff."
"Further, employees worked upwards of 150% hours during Covid, and were not compensated for that either."
"this bank is a corporate monster, and does not care for employees or employees's families at all."
Good.
Good company and encourage our continual growth and development.
Everyone here is nice and loves to have a good time and get out of the office to team-build.
Fun but not .
Very sterile the hire fire ratio is soo high nobody stays there too long they expect you to be a robot on the call line and not have a personal life and no chances at all and don't have feelings towards personal growth
It's a good place to work.
Lots of room for advancement and good management.
They will help you arms train you at every step.
They have generous leave policies and the on boarding is really smooth.
Mostly focused on metrics. .
Everything is metrics driven.
Not much support offered after training.
Reaching out to Retail Support consist of someone sending an article to research and find your solution.
Tenured employees have later shifts and new hires get earlier shifts.
Workforce will accommodate your request.
Supervisor was not supportive.
Pay is not worth the job.
Great!.
Excellent management and growth opportunities.
Supportive culture that is focused on providing the training and resources needed to help each employee.
this bank is a family oriented company .  
this bank cares about this bank's employees and customers the pay is good and so is management management are easy to talk to and willing to assist in helping you meet your career goals
Doing better with technology.
I spent a little over a decade at this bank and during a little over a decade this bank started getting serious about putting into place updated technology.
this bank That part from old stuff to newer tech.
That part was good.
One part that wasn't good is that management was hit or miss.
For the last 5 or 6 years I had a manager who really didn't do much to help with advancement or getting the training needed to do better.
"And then a manager who really didn't do much to help with advancement or getting the training needed to do better's manager made vacation taking difficult, especially around Christmas and New Years."
Bank teller.
"Decent bank to work for but the pay is low, and you always have to sell all sorts of financial products, credit cards, to people that don't have money anyway."
So why induce people to get in more debt when you see people already don't have money.
There are monthly goals that probably no bank/branch achieves but are there to put you in a hot spot.
Worked here while in college.
After graduation I moved on to a better stable and nice job.
don't't work in banks.
"banks're so unethical ( what a shocker, of course banks are)."
Diversity was the only plus.
Everything else was awful.
"Being a call center, you have to take way too many calls."
"You literally do not have a full second between calls, the second a customer disconnects there is another customer already speaking."
They literally track your bathroom time.
Everyday you have a 15 min team meeting with about 10 ppl in the middle of hundreds of other employees and they rate you on about 8 different Categories.
They put this huge board and write in red marker everything you did wrong.
It's awful.
Good.
I feel that this bank is a great company to work for.
When it comes to scheduling it can be difficult to get the schedule changed and to move to a different position can sometimes take quite a bit of time but this bank is still a great company to work for this bank have great benefits and willing to work with employees.
Good job
but it can be stressful and disheartening.
The customers reviews on your service can make or break your experience here.
"If the ATM doesn't work and the customer gives this bank (you) a 1 star rating, it destroys not only your quarter but the branches, too."
You meet wonderful regulars and build relationships but survey and sale expectations are unreasonable.
Good Place to Work.
It felt like working with family.
Everyone at the branch was extremely friendly and caring of one another.
"the branch was located in a tourist destination, and the hardest part of the job would be the rush that followed any major holiday or event."
Expect an FTE reduction every couple of years.  
this bank is well-known for RIFing senior personnel every couple of years in order to save on salary and benefit expenses.
You are safe until you reach 50 then you might want to start looking for another opportunity.
Love it.
Personally I love working for this bank.
"I love that I get to help people daily, management truly want management's employees to succeed and do what management can to help teach and build careers."
Just Okay.
"Salary extremely low, work culture was great in my branch but branch was chosen for a permanent increase in branch hours to close at 6 daily but no increase in pay."
Worst working environment. .
The environment at this job was one of the worse.
The environment at this job was extremely stressful and unfriendly.
Most of the management was impolite and rude.
"The environment at this job encouraged separation amongst employees, as opposed to team work."
Most of the management didn't want us speaking to each other.
There were a multitude of changes that occurred quite often with poor training.
The environment at this job is too uptight and not employee friendly.
Horrible place to work!!!
They do not care about customers .
Most promotions will not be people of color.
Customers are not put first.
It takes months to get loans closed because departments are fighting internally.
You can escalate to management and nothing will happen.
Worst company I've ever worked for in 25 years.
"They will lie to you during the interview and tell you that everybody is earning a bonus, that isn't true."
They find ways not to pay you a bonus.
You will not even understand how you earned or didn't earn a bonus.
It's some gorilla math equation that they have on an excel sheet and you don't get a copy.
Again the worst company ever.
Talk a great game
but it's all lies!!!!!!
I wouldn't recommend anyone work here and I never have.
Good company.
I really loved working for this bank.
this bank took great care of me when I was on maternity leave.
I worked both in the branches and from home and have nothing but good to say of this bank as employers
Poor pay little job growth.
Many positions that used to exist have been cut.
Roles that should have been promotions were eliminated and work is distributed between branch workers with no raises.
"Job has high expectations, with little growth or rewards."
Enjoyed loan servicing position .
I enjoyed working in the loan servicing call center.
My supervisors were awesome and helped me to improve my customer service skills.
I would definitely work there again if I ever had the opportunity.
It's a great place to work.
I absolutely love my job.
I feel pretty fulfilled and the work itself is great.
Management is amazing.
I get to work independently and I love my group.
Basic bank job.
Nothing negative your basic 9-5 paper pushing bank job.
your basic 9-5 paper pushing bank job has great benefits and if you work with the right people isn't as mentally draining as if you don't.
Pushy sales on products that aren't good for the customer. .
Nice talking to and meeting new people.
Management only cares about making money.
You must be very good and pushy with sales on everyone.
"Good pay, good vacation."
It's alright.  
this bank is fine.
The salary is not where The salary should be considering how much this bank make you do and the size of this bank but you do get a minimum of 3 weeks of vacation.
Benefits are fine.
Moving up is very difficult as HR gate-keeps a lot.
"Everyone seems to work a lot, managers included (avg 45-50 hrs/wk)."
this bank talks a big game about being customer-centered but this bank are not.
"I worked in the branches and in an operational capacity and I can tell you that this bank makes it hard for customers to anything in a modern, easy way."
Now if you're struggling to find a job/need some experience or get your foot in the door of the banking world then it's not a terrible first step.
But get your 1-2 years and get out because raises are nonexistent and the workload only increases.
Good place to work sometimes.  
this bank is a good company to work for most of the time.
"this bank are pretty easy going when you hit all of your goals, however when you don't, get ready to hear your manager micro-manage you all day long and repeatedly tell you what to do."
this bank offer little to no salary increases on a yearly basis.
Great work life balance .
The work life balance is great and the benefits are alright.
There is not much room for advancement.
"Being a bank, we don't use the most up-to-date technology."
great place to work but......
Depending on the team or branch your experience can be great.
but if your on a team that doesn't work as a team then your screwed.
I was fortunate enough to be on a great team that helped me during my time.
Making a sale seems to be most important.
All about the numbers.
.
"If you're good at scamming people to open accounts people don't need, this is the job for you."
They only pay you well if you ensure every single person that walks in the door opens an account.
Horrible- stay away from AML.
Stay far away from AML here.
"AML do not pay well, AML bring in new people with higher salaries but make the wrong decision on who to hire."
Raises are a joke!
Even with meeting and exceeding all goals you get 1%!!
"We daily work overtime but are salaried for 40 hours, we work between 55-80 hours a week with no choice, we work on vacations, we work on 'paid holidays'."
"We always work, we are treated like garbage, they pick apart any mini mistake you make from typos to attachments, you better no reach out to management or you will get talked down to for even speaking to management."
They hold round tables with high ups where you can't even express things because others tell management and you get in trouble.
Turnover is insane here for these reasons and more.
"We have QAs, investigators, managers and analysts quitting daily or weekly."
Stay away!!
Any bank is better!
Good Company: Horrible with internal advancement.
The company overall is very good.
"However, even for top performers, the ability to get meaningful pay raises year over year is extremely limited."
This promotes a culture of jumping jobs either internally or externally to get ahead.
Worst Working environment for clients and associates .
Worst financial Institution to work for.
"Poor Management guidance, coaching and motivation."
"Don't care about their clients financial needs and economic success , every client equal a $#+push products + a ridiculous survey."
Poor and unprofessional management style.
Micromanaging system.
Poor internal branch support for associates.
If you want to have a miserable work life come to work here.
Not much to say.
This company is alright.
It all depends on your manager and your location.
Sometimes you meet great people.
Sometimes you meet not so great people....
It was okay.
I worked for 1 year as In-Store Banker.
"I had a great time, but I had to leave In-Store Banker because I did not like working on Sunday."
"Great people, Great Company Culture."
I really liked working here
Universal Banker.
"The good: The compensation for the Universal Banker role is pretty good, and you do really well with referrals, selling credit cards, and meeting your quarterly quota, you get decent bonuses."
"The workload is pretty decent, I guess it also depends what your branch is like."
"The neutral:The products are just like any other bank, the difference is how The products name The products."
"It's important to go over all the fees with customers when you open accounts because some caught me off guard (example: when you can charge for a replacement card/when not to charge)The bad:I've noticed a lot of turnover lately with bakers and managers; and when you don't have a branch or assistant manager to guide you through your first few weeks, your constantly looking up policies and procedures by yourself, and trying to learn 3 different systems."
"In my specific branch my colleague have helped a bit, but I can't help but think my colleague are planning an exit too."
Solid company from top to bottom.
Leadership has made a series of good decisions that has positioned the company for long-term growth.
the company does a great job of providing rewards and recognition to deserving individuals.
Work From Home.  
this bank is a great work place-
"I have the opportunity to work from home, this bank's very comfortable for me because I have over 10 years of customer service experience."
I've been employed with this bank over a year now.
"I like this bank due to the high call volume, team leads are very helpful, I've been on two different teams and two different teams were awesome!"
"As long as you come to work on time, follow the rules, and provide excellent customer service you will go far with this bank!!"
I've been promoted three times in one year!
Conservative company with poor management.
Some successful people were terminated at this bank just because Some successful people reasonably complained about Some successful people's branch manager's behavior.
"Instead of helping Some successful people, the higher management terminated Some successful people for a bogus reason."
I worked with Some successful people personally and know what was going on.
People can't speak out freely and are afraid of losing People's jobs.
I left because I realized that this bank is not the best place to develop as this bank encourages a hostile atmosphere in the branch.
"If you don't complain and meet this bank's sales goals, you'd be most likely fine."
"Some branches, however, have great managers that value Some branches's employees, but great managers that value their employees are rare."
"Other than that, if you work hard, you can earn good money there."
Great pay.
This company is unfair and only worries about the higher ups in the corporation .
the higher ups in the corporation will turn on you on a heartbeat.
Very selfish and mean at times .
Loan Support Analyst.
Good company overall.
The company provides good benefits.
There is also life work balance.
The management can be flexible with time especially when it comes doctor's appointments.
Good place to work.
Good place to work but don't expect a raise you will need to move up to make money.
The benefits are good but expensiveNot enough work from home opportunities
Management is horrible .
Only two maybe three managers out of the many that I've met have actually been good managers.
The others have no business being a manager.
"The training is horrible here and if a manager has it out for you for no reason other than a manager're bored or trying to look good to higher ups and money hungry, you're scared to lose your job."
You're expected to know things you haven't been taught even in roles you haven't been in a full year and written up for not having enough appointments even during a pandemic.
a manager's computer system is as old as the hills and not easy to manage.
Have I mentioned a manager's training is awful?
Just a great place to work.
Great work life balance.
Work from home is supported and engagement is well maintained.
Company has great values and transparency.
Growth and development are constantly worked on with employees and managers.
I always feel valued.
Pay and benefits are great.
I've had good and bad managers
but I think all companies have that.
"When I had a bad manager, I had the resources to work through issues unlike other places I have worked."
Productive .
Wonderful place to work with great management/support group.
One thing for sure you will stay busy..
it's constant work daily... but overall I truly enjoy it
Mixed feelings .
"I have mixed feelings, really depends where you're working."
Depends on the manager and the team.. ..
hr is a complete joke.
You basically have to put up w bad behavior bc if you make a complaint things get ugly for you even though the manager and the team swear that the manager and the team take retaliation seriously 😒
No clear direction or support on new initiatives .
"New program with no administrative help, retail bank and investments had different objectives, no accountability for senior management in cooperation with New program with no administrative help"
Great benefits and good compensation plan .
Working here is great.
"Management is good, the process can be a bit stressful when the system doesn't work."
But overall the job function is not difficult.
As long as you work they leave you alone so you can be productive and do your job!.
Great place to work but the management is not the greatest.
Some people are just not cut out for managing people.
Work life balance is ok but if your not grinding the work each and everyday you get treated differently.
Great Company.
Great work experience.
I needed to complete this review so I was able to look at other reviews on this source for a school project.
Other than that I actually work for this bank and this bank is a great company to work for.
Mortgage Consultant .
"The job is fairly easy, the problem lies with bonuses were taken away, yet we were given the task to take multiple department calls."
"Also you may be told one thing, and then have to accept another."
"Mortgage needed help, we were asked to train and move there with new schedules (mon-fri), only to accept and start and be told we had to keep the same schedules."
the good is you will take a lot of calls .
"you will never be bored because the calls are always back to back especially in core, however when management is the problem you cant talk to higher ups higher ups don't do anything"
Good start in banking.
banking was a good place to start when you don't know any better.
They take advantage of new to bank employees to pay new to bank employees very low in comparison.
"Short staffed branches, poor upper management."
Charlotte market is the laughing stock of all of this bank.
Great people.  
this bank has a great work-life balance and a pretty decent compensation package.
The people there are great and I would definitely work there again if I could
work environment .
good place if you like to work from home but very stressful environment on the phone and you have to be on your own most of the time with the client.
Good place to work to get experience but pay It's not good .
Managers are great and Managers really helped you.
You could move up very fast with the company.
"the company does have great benefits like pension, 401k and many more."
"Pay is very low, for the job you do."
Good for Employees.
Not bad place to work for employees.
"Nice benefits, nice vacation time and paid time off policies."
Day to day job not too challenging but can get very monotonous.
Wish it were busier.
Some Branches have very slow traffic while others are always hopping.
Great company to work for though.
"Our leads were old and always the same names, they should also offer more competitive deposit products."
Horrible place to work.
Play favorites!!!!!
"This company is a JOKE a lot of gossiping, breaking rules HR Doesn't care!"
Nobody cares about YOU!
This company closing branches all the time and left ppl without job.
Foot in the Door.
I wouldn't recommend working for this company at a branch however you would learn a lot for your next career opportunity.
I did enjoy my job as a teller however once I moved up I began hating my position and breaking down on my lunch break due to stress.
this company has also taken away many of the benefits I earned when I first started to give more to customers.
Job security.
Always knew what needed to be done.
Enjoyed my customers and fellow team members.
There are many commercials and print ads for this bank which gives this bank great name recognition.
No advancement management has favorites.
OverallMy experience working at this bank your just another employeeDo Not work here no room for advancement no training to do new roles the training they have is on a computer that you get on orientation.
Blackout dates and rules on how you can use your vacation seniority gets1st picks on vacations if your denied for a date and call-out
your written up.
You only get 7 call-outs but have to wait a full year to receive 7 call-outs again (call-outs do not renew every January) if you use more than 5 call-outs your placed on a verbal warning.
Raises are horrible 5 and 10 cents for doing your best and your manager gets to determine how much of a raise if any you get do not apply here unless you enjoy being taken advantage of and lied too.
Being the Lead Teller will drain the life out of you..
Work-life balanceMy personal favorite are all the work conversations to your personal phone on your off time!
Everything is personal.
Always and forever short staffed.
Worst place I've ever worked .
Their call center is too busy and if you love yourself you won't work there.
The management is toxic the pay is trash for the amount of stuff you deal with on the daily with their customers.
Look someone else.
Okay job for someone with no experience.
Got boring after a few months - nothing new to learn.
No advancement in the company.
Customers were often rude but you had to take it because 'customers are always right'
Good paying part-time job.
The pay was good for a part-time job.
"For the most part, everyone was fairly nice and willing to help me learn."
"The company tried to make sure we were as safe as possible during COVID, which was nice."
"However, there was a lot of pressure on everyone to make sales which made for a tense work environment."
Wouldn't go back but overall the job was decent.
Only interested in the RICHEST of the RICH.  
this bank often stressed the need to SELL SELL SELL this bank's products.
"this bank does not want customers with lower or middle class families, this bank are only interested in wealthy customers whom use this bank credit cards."
"The management is a joke as The management is the same people year to year, The management are not management because of any degree of skill, solely because The management kiss butt and agree with everything the boss says."
High turn over.
Ok to work here.
They only really care if they can benefit.
Very stressful you only advance if you are a favorite.
Not cool at all upper management is unfair
Good Place to work Sales.  
this bank is a great company to work for if you are looking for a sales position.
this bank truly care about this bank's employees and do all that this bank can to make sure the work environment is safe and inclusive.
The management cares about The management's employees and their employees's ability to progress in their employees's careers.
It is overall a safe bet to grow your career.
Lots of work for little pay.
I worked inside a giant and they wanted us to hassle the shoppers for credit cards while the shoppers shopped.
The pay was also bad for the amount of work they wanted you to do.
Stable .
"benefits are great, management is great management truly care about you."
management are not pushy on sales.
Excellent work like balance time off and flexible schedule
Great career.
Always room to grow.
Lots of information and training.
Customer and sale focused.
Time management can sometimes be hard.
Great products and solutions for all ages
"Enjoyable at times, but not always the best.."
For the most part it is a good work environment.
This position is more for an entry level/stepping stone into other positions within the company.
The co-workers are nice to work with.
"The job The job itself is nothing special, along with the pay."
the company offers great benefits.
Wealth Management Intern.
Not very respectfulReally didn't attribute any actual tangible workHad to figure out almost everything on my ownBoss was very niceThe internship program had no direction and I did not learn very much good pay
Good company going downhill.  
"this bank was great at first, customer service was the most important goal."
"Then, almost overnight, sales became the dominating concern."
Initially I worked in a branch environment.
"The sales pressure over time became intolerable, so I decided to apply for and obtain a position in a less stressful environment."
"In my role as client Solution Specialist, it was a great, very professional atmosphere."
Many good people.
"Unfortunately a position in a less stressful environment is a position you cannot learn with a handful of books, training that consisted of 5 days sitting and watching another rep, and a 'buddy' via Skype, who was mostly tied up with their own jobs to take time to assist."
"Asking for assistance was frowned upon, and nothing shy of perfection was treated as a disaster, where good performance was rarely addressed."
"this bank started as a great job, but the sales pressure in the retail side, and the borderline hostile atmosphere of the , it became a nightmare that worsened daily."
2015 this bank was a great company.
Throughout 2016 this bank was mostly downhill.
2017 became absolutely intolerable from a stress standpoint to the degree I resigned before I even had alternative employment lined up.
It was that stressful.
Upper Management .  
this bank is a great company for benefits.
"Other than that, this bank do not pay well, Upper Management is lacking proper leadership models and most are not fair and honest with employees."
Great management.  
this bank really wants to see all of this bank's employees grow and succeed.
Although there are a lot of tasks to complete within a single workday.
You are surrounded by a team to help make it happen.
Terrible.
Wasted many years at this job.
this bank preaches about inclusiveness and diversity and I didn't experience either of inclusiveness and diversity working here.
"Management did not follow any guidelines for the pandemic, no temp checks/masks worn etc."
Manager let several employees keep coming into work sick.
Lots of racist and prejudice comments made every day.
Extremely hostile work environment.
You will get bullied until you finally leave if they don't like you or you don't fit in.
This didn't only happen to just me at this branch either.
"Customer surveys reflect how terrible most associates are, I often carried the team to get bonus at end of quarter."
I have spent many days physically sick from the stress I have endured from working here.
Expect your mental health to plummet.
Good job.
I loved the part time position I had.
Also they train well
but you get a better hang of everything when you actually start to work on the phones and get comfortable speaking with people.
Great place to work introducing clients to banking products..
I enjoyed introducing banking clients to banking products that would help banking clients with banking clients's financial issues.
Having repeat clients requesting my service was extremely rewarding to me.
So many sale and referral.
"I used to work for this bank for the last 16 years, this bank offered me an early retirement since MarchIt was nice to work there , good benefit but too stressful , always shorted staffs"
Company walks Company's talk.
Very good company to work for; great training program; good pay; great management.
Company cares about continuous improvement.
Also company seeks to develop talent within organization.
Strong organizational communication is practiced at all levels.
High stress work environment .
The company confuses the daily tracking of activities with quantifiable results.
Much time is wasted tracking behaviors that do not lead to required goal achievement.
"This creates a stressful, unproductive work environment."
Additionally there are too many layers of management in this organization which muddies communication from the top down.
"Finally, the centralization of decision making creates barriers to nimbly assist customers in any meaningful way."
Great place to work!.
Great place to work!
Supportive management and team members.
Flexibility in scheduling.
Work life balance.
Champion of social justice.
Allowed to work from home during pandemic.
Cliquey Environment.
Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at this bank are fantastic.
Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at this bank pay you fairly and Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at this bank also give you plenty of PTO as well as holidays.
The health and dental benefits were fantastic and were very affordable for a single individual.
Great benefits and room to grow..
"I haven't started yet, but from what I could tell this bank truly cares for this bank's employees and the benefits/PTO is definitely a plus."
Highly recommend working for this bank.
Branch Banker Associate.
Do not listen to what The company promise you.
You will work 9-10 hour days in a glorified retail position.
"The company allows for customers to walk all over you, so long as customers are happy."
The only thing that The company are concerned about is making a sale and trying to bring up numbers.
The company care very little for work-life balance and instead want you to be committed to a culture of selling and putting customers before your family.
"If it was not for my manager, I would have quit long ago."
"You will meet plenty of great co-workers, but it does not make up for the poor excuse of the rest of the job."
The technology is 30 years behind and the systems you work with often crash or are not user friendly.
"In the position I worked, I had to do personal banking and teller work."
"You would think that would justify some kind of pay raise, but you will make marginally more than a teller and less than a banker."
Essentially you are paid to do two jobs while receiving the pay of one job.
"The hours are long, and often I have worked 3-4 Saturdays a month."
"In terms of career advancement, it really depends on how they are feeling."
They will tell you that after the first year of working here that you are able to move anywhere in The company.
"This is false doctrine, as they have denied me to 14 different jobs that I have applied for since my one year."
"Unless you produce an unholy amount of sales, they have no interest in moving you from retail."
"In conclusion, if you like sales and customer service you will enjoy a glorified retail position."
Personally I value a work-life balance and the retail positions at The company do not - more...
Decent company with good benefits but lacking compensation.
I worked for this bank for five years and only during my last year did I have a manager that did a manager that did their best to see about where I wanted to go in the company's best to see about where I wanted to go in this bank..
"this bank has great benefits with this bank's 401k, health, dental, vision and employee stock purchasing."
Working in retail banking gets very tiring..
After awhile you get tired of the clientele that comes in with overdrawn accounts every other day that can't manage the clientele that comes in with overdrawn accounts every other day that can't manage their accounts's accounts.
If you're good at multiple tasks don't be surprised to be taken advantaged of.
I was the ATM custodian for years because another coworker was too slow.
And I was expected to manage the teller line and also do banking on the platform side.
Worked very hard day to day and deserved to be in a better position or at least be getting raises as I had always had a meets all yearly review.
"Also, the incentives you receive quarterly were lacking and felt like a joke."
Great coworkers .
Work-life balanceHighly gossip-ridden corporation.
High stress.
Not enough staff.
Poor SchedulePay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at this bank are poor.
"They keep taking away ability to earn incentivesJob security and advancementZero opportunity for advancementManagementIn general, managers at this bank turnover quickly."
"CultureGreat co-workersOverallSell-sell-sell, close to Wells Fargo."
Unethical practice
Enjoyed working here. .
I enjoyed working for this bank.
Advancement in the company.
Short staffed most of the time and a lot of turnover in branches.
Compensation was good.
Time off was good and all of the company's benefits were great.
Great Benefit.
Requires high standards in salesBeing a Teller is extremely easy.
They give you trainingBanker Job requires more.
Hours are extended which sucks a little 9-6 m-f
Pay.
The pay is good.
"As for job security, It all depends on what department your working in and the position."
"If coming in as a temp., Your most likely going to be just that, a temp."
Good job.
The people make it worth it and if u like working in a fast paced environment then a fast paced environment is great for you and is helpful with family
You get what you give.
"I have seen some amazing careers happen within this bank for people who try and are open to change, that are hard working and love people."
I have seen careers end quickly when there was a bad fit.
"this bank heavily emphasizes you being in charge of your own development with this bank as a support and for me personally, I have loved it and I feel like I have plenty of support when I am looking for a good next step in my career."
Low pay and stressful work environment. .
Work-life balance at this bank is not good.
My pay and benefits at this bank are low
A lot is changing .
DO NOT PLAN ON
BANKERS HOURS HERE!
A lot has changed around expectations on your work life balance.
this bank claims to have been voted top 10 for mother's.. that's a joke in my opinion.
this bank hold this bank's employees to a great standard of excellence and I will never discredit that
but you end up putting your all into this bank to realize you're a number to this bank unless you provide something.
Branch Banker.
Work-life balanceMy management team and colleagues are great to work with always can count on anyone if assistance is neededPay & benefitsI have no complaintsJob security and advancementThey always go within for open positions before going externalManagementMy manager is awesome hands downCultureNothingOverallI have no plans to leave.
I enjoy working for this bank.
I see long-term goals .
I would highly recommend any close friend or family member to work for this bank.
Toxic.
If you enjoyed high school than you will enjoy this bank.
If you are a Manager it's impossible to be successful.
You are told to manage and coach but the regional managers encourage hourly employees to call HR and complain.
HR is like the parents of the kid who got a C on the test.
HR is a joke
Work from home .
Absolutely horrible experience.
I was literally interrogated during training because the mentor apparently didn't like me.
I was fired for issuing a credit to a customers account even though my manager told me it was OK.
I was reported to an ethics line for it.
No one there likes No one there's job.
Money is decent but Money's just horrible.
As bad as collections.
Really Customer Oriented .
"Overall, great bank to work at since the local branches are well-organized and are very friendly."
the local branches really give opportunities to employees to grow.
Racist Company.
"They are extremely unprofessional, vindictive, the initiators of office politics and create hostile work environments."
They encourage their less productive workers to harass their more productive workers.
They are very intimidated by those who are more knowledgeable than them who are in lower positions than they are.
They know those who are more knowledgeable than them who are in lower positions than they are have the potential to go a lot further in the company and they pull out all the stops to keep that from happening.
On top of that I complained to the EEOC and the EEOC fired me.
"They like to keep people around who are less knowledgeable than them, brown nose and have no ethics or morals."
"As long as people around who are less knowledgeable than them are around, people around who are less knowledgeable than them know that there positions are safe."
"Whereas someone whose a strong performer, knowledgeable and is able to do someone whose a strong performer, knowledgeable and is able to do their job well with integrity's job well with integrity, someone whose a strong performer, knowledgeable and is able to do their job well with integrity try to get rid of and are very successful at doing it"
Good pay and benefits .  
this bank is a solid company with good benefits.
"Branches have set hours, and tellers don't need to stay indefinitely after work because the vault needs to be closed."
Retail banking isn't for everyone.
"Some customers are just angry and irrational, particularly when Some customers have caused Some customers's own problem."
"Unfortunately, Some customers sometimes get the opportunity to answer a survey about you personally after Some customers visit the branch."
"this bank takes these surveys as gospel, and you can end up doing your job well, correctly, and kindly but being dinged in the survey by unreasonable customers."
You have no defense.
"Something else that's hard is that this bank is very oriented to large cities, and this bank's sales techniques and expectations don't play well in small towns where you have the same customers over and over."
"this bank don't want a credit card, as this bank told you last week and the week before, and some don't like that tellers are looking at their accounts closely, even to see what services or upgrades might really be helpful."
They also don't like waiting in a line out the door because tellers are required to try to sell or set an appointment with each transaction.
Never worked for a more horrible establishment.
The company is ridiculous the staff talks about every other staff member the drama in The company is worse then being in high school and if your not apart of the manager click then The company will do everything to get you fired The company
paid time off.
"Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at this bank , I think this bank are doing a very good job with security an advancement."
Team work.
Was very educational.
engaging and inclusive in all Managers's aspects Managers made you feel engaged in learning the company ways and sought to guide you through the process of understanding the company's objectives
Needs Improvement.
Pay isn't great but this is a good starter job and you will learn a lot.
"Compared to other banks around , they are lower paying."
Incentives have been taken away and it gives you no purpose to really work for this company.
Good Stepping stool.
Good stepping stool as a teller.
"If you are not a salesperson, don't bother."
The numbers game is very prevalent in this industry.
"The numbers game can become monotonous, unless you have a manager who's humane enough to pay you well and help you grow."
Promotes diversity and inclusion.  
this bank will give you the opportunity grow your career if you choose.
The embrace diversity and encourage involvement in the community .
I was employed for 12 years until Covid caused my department to shut down permanently.
Opportunities to work at home if that fits your lifestyle.
Unfair .
My manager was a nightmare
Nice then stabs you in backShe was prejudice Company does not stand behind employees Salary doesn't compare to other banks
Consultant .
"Was stressful but stable job , the job itself was what you expect from a typical call center job."
Stress on top of stress.
The company was ok but the job the job itself wasn't for me.
Typical call center.
Worked in default department collecting on past due credit card accounts.
"Low hourly pay, back to back calls."
Ok for students or someone just needing this temporary to get by.
Productive and a very good work environment .
Good benefits and an awesome work place.
Had no issues and also learned a lot working there as well.
"Dealt with a lot of customers who had a lot of problems and I had learned how to solve a lot of problems in a timely matter, with multitasking as well!"
PTSD will get you fired.
Had trouble advancing due to being told no continually in taking classes for advancement.
Managers who do not follow policies are not reprimanded.
Those associates who do not follow policies get advancement opportunities quicker.
PTSD or any mental disabilities will get you fired.
Human Resources only concerned about accommodations for physical but not mental disabilities.
It is only about sales and have you push products such as credit cards even if products such as credit cards is not best for customers.
Managers make the difference.
"During my almost six years at this bank, I had one phenomenal manager and one horrible manager."
The difference drove me to leave this bank.
"The corporate side is much more in tune with employees, employees's needs and concerns and opinions."
The retails side is not.
It's all about reaching your numbers.
Customer Service Associate.
OverallGreat place to work!
"Great benefits, paid vacation, flexible hours, training is provided accordingly, give you chances to learn and opportunities to grow within the Organization."
"Changing, and not for the better.."
I can only speak for working in the branch.
Do not go anywhere near the branch if you have prior successful sales experience in banking.
The incentive program is a rat race and training is nonexistent.
Wonderful company benefits.
Benefits package is unmatched.
"Only downfall, most branches do not have much opportunity to be promoted."
Pay could be better with all the positions entail.
Branch Services and Sales Associate.
Good team atmosphere and this bank is really focused on continuous training and development .
"Culture is also important here, I worked on a campus"
so I was able to participate in a lot of students events which was stressful time but really fun at the same time.
I would definitely recommend this bank.
Nice to start out .
It pays a decent amount for you job you do and the benefits for part timers are decent.
I wish the company had standard hours for part timers like the company can't work more than 30 hours a week.
Unfortunately most part timers work just under 40 hours (for example 37-38) hours without reaping full time benefits.
That is unfair and misleading.
this bank's a slave shop.
"Work the people as much as possible, then cut the people..  this bank is a bad work environment, this bank's cronyism at the worst."
"If you don't know the right people, your life is done."
"If you are not a yes person, your manager will get revenge."
Good place to start.
"Good place to start in the financial / sales industry, pays industry standard for tellers."
"401k and benefits available, part time schedules available for those going to college and looking for a part time job with regular hours."
A LOT of sales pressure.
Less than average compensation for bankers in the financial / sales industry.
"Limited opportunity for growth, and when you do prove your worth, your pay bump is barely recognizable."
Great place to work.  
this bank keeps employees in the know and offers a great work-life balance.
"The people at this bank are usually very nice and easy to work with, making it easy to come to work each day."
Racist Company.
"A typical day at work here is not easy, the management was not respectful and the CEO didn't seem to care."
the best part was co workers and customers co workers made the day.
But overall this company is racist.
I failed a charge with the EEOC and the EEOC fired me about a week later.
MIS is not stable.
Management in MIS practice house cleaning every 6 months regardless of your ability.
Positions are eliminated.
Go work in Retail.
Processes change every 6 months.
Agile is not industry standard.
Horrible Management & Unfair Treatment.
Management is absolutely horrendous.
The managers are two-faced.
I felt like I am not treated equally based on position.
"The managers have favorites, there is always some sort of drama that The managers sit in office all day and gossip."
The benefits are nice.
"The managers seem to think treating The managers's employees like animals and brainwashing us into thinking this is normal treatment is The managers fired the two employees that were open about the two employees that were open about their sexuality's sexuality and I find that interesting - this bank boasts about this bank's diversity, yet The managers fired the two employees that were open about their sexuality...our staff consists of only two POC (the rest is entirely white)."
"The new employee that The managers hired got terminated within a week (The new employee that they hired was also a POC, for reference).I learned to stick up for myself, not be taken advantage of (even though it almost got me fired multiple times).I went to The managers to file a complaint against another employee for inappropriate misconduct, yet The managers turned a complaint against another employee for inappropriate misconduct into a lesson on how I was wrong for coming to The managers and a complaint against another employee for inappropriate misconduct wasn't important enough to be filed on my behalf."
I felt like I wasn't heard and I was bashed for bringing the situation to light.
The branch manager breaks the dress code consistently.
I wore a pair of heels (once) & they did not have a strap on the back.
I got called into the office and was demanded to change my shoes.
"Wearing short dresses, sleeveless shirts/dresses, etc, the dress code doesn't apply to The branch manager."
Abuse of power & position.
"The branch manager boldly told our staff, to our staff's faces, with no hesitation, about The branch manager's breast augmentation, because her breast augmentation is ethical and her breast augmentation is definitely - more..."
Poor Management & Leadership.
Poor Management & Leadership does not care about Poor Management & Leadership's employees unless you have a Management title.
Poor Management & Leadership will overlook complaints and concerns regarding management until a Client complains or reports it.
Nothing .
upper management does not care about you as an employee.
You can tell upper management you are being bullied by your superiors and upper management do not care to listen to you.
The environment is very toxic
Stressful.
"The people you work with and for are fine, but the training isn't the same and many haven't gotten full retraining as they change over the past 20 years."
No one seems to be on the same page and the customers can see that.
Former Pgh Employee.
● Work-life balanceMy branch had absolutely no work life balance.
"It was basically like you back to high school in terms of the employees being extremely over-dramatic, refusing to do the employees's jobs, and there was never follow up from management unless it was to punish."
"Even then, it felt like management didn't want to handle out of control employees."
"Because of that, I was constantly on call, coming in on my days off and staying late but getting in trouble for the amount of overtime I inevitably accrued."
● Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with this bank are grossly under compensated for Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with this bank's role.
Pay & benefitsTeller supervisors with this bank were expected to act as managers with barely an increase in salary from a basic full- or part-time teller.
● Job security and advancement this bank always has opportunities for advancement but this bank will absolutely play favorites on who this bank allow to progress.
"● ManagementManagement, from branch to upper management, only care about meeting ManagementManagement, from branch to upper management's sales goals."
"You are not a valued employee, you are a small part of a large machine."
"It does not matter if you are sick, overworked, in need of help from your management team, your management team are not there for you."
"● CultureIt was like walking back into high school, complete with cliques and double standards."
"If you want a professional career, avoid banking at the branch level with this bank unless you have the patience of a saint."
"● OverallOverall, I do not recommend this bank as a place to establish a professional career in banking or otherwise unless you are okay with playing the role of either yes man or scapegoat."
The Banker Era is over.
The bank industry was already not doing as great but now with COVID-19.
The Banker Era is done.
Too much responsibility with low pay.
Too much drama!.
Not a Bad Place to Work.  
"this bank has a lot of potential, overall this bank is a great company."
"Personally I just experienced a team that was losing management, resources, support, and respect from partners at this bank."
"I've noticed the department does a very poor job at re-hiring much needed resources, however I can't speak on behalf of this bank."
Terrible .
Most of the leadership is extremely conservative and republican — Most of the leadership talk a good game but the disrespect is everywhere This outfit operates totally on favoritism and a caste systemI spent over a decade here and am so happy I left Be careful
Worked with a great team; HR needs to learn to do thorough investigations.
I worked at this bank for 5 years.
I had some great co-workers that made working there not so bad.
The pay wasn't too bad either.
"HR doesn't conduct thorough investigations - HR call and interview you about an incident, then fire you a couple days later."
HR don't bother to send somebody to the branch to do a thorough investigation.
Your opinion matters.
Inclusive work culture.
Work environment is very fast and at times grueling.
Culture is supportive and inclusive.
You don't mind working hard for a company that values you and what you contribute.
Don't be fooled.....
"Poor training, yet, you will be expected to know everything and continuously micromanaged (no room for you to apply what you learned and grow)."
"Harassment, disrespect, undervalued, favoritism from managers - you will not be measured by your work/merit, it will be whether or not a manager 'likes' you."
this bank doesn't practice what this bank preaches.
this bank sure knows how to make this bank look good on paper.
Managers abuse of Managers's position to invade your privacy (e.g. demanding to use cameras to see inside your home) - and this bank will sit back and let Managers turn the workplace into a school playground.
It's something new and a great experience .
"I really enjoy working at this bank I've learned so much it's just a great experience overall, this bank also have great Benefits for you and your family also."
Not at all prepared for surges in volume.
They don't seem prepared for fluctuations in work volume.
Pay is low for market standards so they have a hard time bringing on staff.
Bonus can be lucrative but Bonus's easy to lose
Stretches Employees Thin.
I was a 'part time' teller who was regularly scheduled 45+ hours a week.
"But they preach no overtime under any circumstance so I would often be there 6 days a week for 9+ hours a day, with 1-2 hour unpaid lunches where I just sort of sat around and waited to clock back in,"
"all so I could stay under 39.75 hours, or god forbid they'd have to pay me benefits."
I was told this was temporary as they were short staffed
but this went on for the entire time I worked there.
Within a few months of being there I was one of the senior-most tellers because the turnover rate was so high and everyone around me left.
Management expects so much of you and it's impossible to meet all quotas and expectations.
The customers are allowed to walk all over you and you just have to eat it with a smile.
Management expects you to do the job of 3-4 people yet doesn't even pay well enough to cover the job you were hired to do.
Worst job I've ever had.
I took a $6/hour pay cut to work somewhere else because I was so desperate to get out.
Company needs a lot of improvement.
Company needs a lot of improvement.
I would seriously reconsider working here.
Poor management and very stressful.
Employees are not valued.
There is no room for growth.
The system is horrible.
Great for entry level.
A great place to learn the industry.
The benefits are pretty good.
Salaries are ok at best.
Layoffs should be a concern for anyone not in upper management.
Fun but stressful.
Bad management but great team.
We got paid for training and travel which was nice.
Favoritism is huge in the company and as long as the company like you the company give you anything.
If sales are good you get nothing.
Life/Work.
You are merely just a number with this bank.
"Incentive programs have been removed, additional hours during week and Saturdays added to schedule with no notice and overtime is unacceptable."
"If you're short staffed, plan to work like a dog without a break."
Management on all levels is a joke!
Poisoned Environment.
Over time it became painfully apparent just how unhealthy the working environment and culture of this bank is.
Top persons in management engages in gossipy conversations about you on a daily basis.
Employees are put to watch and report on other employees so that Employees are able to advance to other positions within this bank etc.
the working environment and culture of this bank is poisoned and the environment is unhealthy and it gets worse every day.
Great company except no flexibility.
● Work-life balanceIt is a salary job so not flexible on hours.
That makes it tough if you have kids with doctors appointments.
● OverallI have two kids and I'm a single parent.
Since this is a salary job you do not have much flexibility.
When your kid gets sick then you may not have the ability to stay home with your kid.
development Program .
The development program is an excellent way to break into the company.
The development program puts you on the fast track for promoting from within.
Also you really get to learn a lot about your lines of business.
Virtual - Productive and engaging place to work in
.
"During my time working here of a year and two months, I've received three trainings and have tenured my experience in this role ."
It has enhanced my experience as an individual and as a part of the company .
Wouldn't recommend .
Working for a bigger company has its ups and downs.
The longer a person has worked there the more a person get away with stuff.
There are people I've seen who should have been fired between people I've seen who should have been fired between their attitude and breaking the rules's attitude and breaking the rules.
If you're new you get scolded over everything while others do worse or the same and don't get others's jobs threatened.
I feel like I don't belong at this bank.
Too stressful to perform like a rock star all the time.
You make a few small mistakes and they don't trust you.
You're told you don't belong there even when you go above and beyond.
I was happy with this job and now I'm miserable.
All the employees are stressed out.
A job shouldn't stress you out or make you feel like you don't fit in.
It seems All the employees complain and back stab you.
It's low pay with little to no advancement.
The care center can be stressful and The care center recently cut out our incentives.
You'll take 70-80 calls a day back-to-back.
Advancement in The care center is minimal.
If you ever dream to get a position off the phone one day.
Keep dreaming.
"Lastly, I've met my goals for a year straight."
Barely any one does and I still haven't been promoted or given a raise.
"Company has an overall good, productive corporate culture that was not always present locally. ."
"Company has an overall good, productive corporate culture that was not always present locally."
The local management doesn't adhere to the feel of the company culture.
"Not rewarded on merit, just your previous work experience."
"Rewarded on politics, not ability to actually perform your job or job functions."
"Surprising that they kept this method of promotion after splitting from the Wells Fargo joint venture, but keeping the same policy."
"No surprise considering all banks on the banking side and finance side have this same form of self destruction that contributes to a lack of loyalty to and from the employees that actually perform, not the senior managers who are glorified tellers or mortgage processors."
Run don't walk away from this place. .
Very low pay for all the expectations you are asked to do.
There is an employee survey available every year.
"You're asked about your opinions but if you give negative ones, be prepared for retaliation from management."
Good pay.
Horrible management. .
The culture is amazing.
They are a great company.
The management in retail on the other hand is horrible.
Selfish.
Never team players.
Its almost like being in elementary school.
"The back and forth, he say she say."
I expected more from the management team.
"If my manager was different, I would have stayed."
Job Has Pro's & Con's.
Overall I feel as if Job was a good job to gain more customer experience.
The pro's to Job is the pay rate (pays really good for a entry level).
Job is pretty stressful as well; you have to know how to deal with the constant yelling from customers and the constant changes within the company that you aren't notified of on time enough to explain to customers.
You can't advance the way you would like to; you have to work a whole year to get your hours changed and their isn't any pay increase unless you change positions.
Management is so so; sometimes Management help but most of the time Management aren't much help at all.
Plus breaks are based off how busy the center is that day; sometimes you were on the phones for 3-4hours before your short break of 15mins.
I liked the pay rate but otherwise it was just to many other problems that continued to happen.
It was hard to follow the policy 100% correctly because it was so many constant changes going on plus you didn't have enough chances to correct anything before they'll write you up.
I wouldn't recommend Job due to the amount of stress your put through and you don't get enough help from Management.
Loan analyst.  
"this bank is a good company however, the pay is very low meaning raises are lack luster."
At times the process seems to be sexist.
Women make a lot more than men.
On top of that if you move up in this bank this bank in a lot of cases give no raise if it's one step up.
"In addition if you are coming into this bank, ask for a lot because this bank may pay you more than somebody who is getting a promotion."
A lot of people join this bank leave for a year or so come back and make way more money than A lot of people join this bank should.
That's what I am working on now leaving the co to perhaps come back.
Allowed to work from home.
You are allowed to work at times from home.
You will put in long hours.
Knowledge of Word and excel essential.
Knowledge of Word and excel do allow ample time to complete exams.
Management.
Horrible managers and work/life balance.
Not a great company to work for especially the branch worked at.
"Managers never know how to help tellers, favorite line 'I'm not a teller, sorry I can't help.'"
this bank INvestments.
There is great opportunity to get your feet wet and also learn the business.
"However, there is little to no room for advancement or to take over old books of business in the NEO area."
Most advisors have decimated the local circuits and are holding tight.
Get your experience and move on.
Ok work environment.
Overall ok place to work but not a lot of opportunity for growth.
Part timers get no vacation or sick time for an entire year.
The work culture overall sucks.
Beware!.
"● Pay & benefitsManagers have great salaries, hourly employees barely get cost of living raises."
● OverallSeems like a good corporation but hourly employees suffer while hourly employees's managers take no accountability for their managers's actions or why their managers's teams fail.
No career advancement besides lateral moves and their managers barely give cost of living raises.
Over 2 years and my salary increased $728 overall with every evaluation being meeting or exceeding expectations.
Be mindful before leaving a job to work for this bank.
Love being a Personal Banker.
I loved working face to face with clients who were already members of this bank or were looking to open up an account of some sort.
"I took my skills and traditions from this bank, such as making a daily to do list, was very organized and enjoyed talking to clients face to face to help clients with clients's accounts, open up new accounts or close clients's accounts."
I also enjoyed saving people's's accounts when people's were thinking of leaving.
I really enjoyed what I learned when I worked there.
Good workplace.
"Great benefits, room to advance, good management, open door policy, good work hours, flexible with your needs most of the time, good work environment"
Great atmosphere is Business Banking.
Great place to work in Business Banking.
The flexibility in Business Banking is second to none.
I really appreciate this part of the job.
My manger is very supportive
Don't apply.
"Horrible, I was hired to work part time, little did I know they would be 4 hour shifts 5 to 6 days a week."
Getting time off was impossible.
They told me my vacation was 3rd week of Oct. and that was it I had no other time off.
Financial Advisors - Not quite.
"When you take a job at this bank as a FA, be prepared to become an insurance agent and not financial advisor no way to hit the target revenue without 90% of monthly sales being some sort of insurance product"
Job.  
this bank took the incentive away in our department ever since then it has not been the same.
I moves to another department and it there is no advance ment to move up
Stable workplace with great customers .
"If you're a solid employee, this is the job for you to stay long term!"
"Customers are regular and you really get to know Customers, which I liked... the only issue I had was the high school feeling work environment among my peers."
Talking behind others backs but nice to others's faces.
the high school feeling work environment among my peers just isn't how I am and made me uncomfortable
Only care about selling.
Sell sell sell sell.
"No concern about customers, no care for anyone else as long as the bank makes a boatload off money."
Lots of pitting branches against each other as well as pitting coworkers against coworkers to see who can sell the most credit cards or loans.
All the bank cares about is sucking customers into products to make sure the bank keep customers stuck with the bank.
Very big on diversity and inclusion.  
this bank doesn't pay the highest among banks.
this bank's incentive program is competitive for top producers.
this bank do care about this bank's employees and this bank's facilitation is to notch.
Disappointed .
I've been with this bank for almost 5 years now.
this bank is a great place for advancement and benefits.
It stops there though.
You are 100% stressed constantly and management could care less about you.
Very contradicting.
Sad for this bank.
Overall just disappointed in the way this bank have handled this bank the last few months.
Was hoping this bank would be a place I could retire from.
Not so sure anymore.
Great Mission Statement.
Great Mission statement that as a corporation they stand by.
Great Mission Statement.
is what drew me in the first place after work for several smaller banks that did not abide by their mission.
"Fair pay, not the best, but they make up for that with other benefits that are there for their employees to take advantage of."
They like to promote from within.
Which is always a plus.
Excellent Benefits .
I enjoyed my teammates and my job duties.
I was really hurt when it was announced that our branch would be closing.
my teammates's training has provided me the blueprint to work at other financial institutions.
my teammates train as if you have never had cash handling experience which is great.
Was okay to work at.
Was okay to work at With really fun and smart coworkers located from different parts of the country and world so it was nice to work with such a diverse group of people.
The Culture is Awesome.
I only left this bank due to health issues and then a move out of the call center area in Jacksonville.
I loved working for this bank.
As a closer this bank broke down the closing position.
You reviewed the loan.
Created the CD and closing package.
After that.
You passed the CD and closing package onto your assigned Funder.
It was efficient and less stressful.
"Remote work,balance work and opportunity to learn new technologies.."
It's nice place to work as remote work is always opened.
Good place to work and learn the new technologies.
One of best thing is working culture as there are no discrepancies between contractor and permanent employee.
Sweatshop without work/life balance.
I worked for this bank for 14 years before leaving without another job lined up because I preferred unemployment during a pandemic (without UC pay) over working for this company another day.
"this bank totes work/life balance and pretend to care about people, yet nothing is further from the truth."
You are a number and a slave.
You will be reminded you are lucky to be employed during a pandemic and this bank will hold that over you as a scare tactic to force you into more and more work without compensation.
Working with the public.
"Good company, lots of training, managers were all great to work with."
Lots of opportunities to work in different locations.
Advancement from within.
Overall good
Loved every minute .
"I had so much support, when my personal life started to conflict with my work life (my child has a disability) this bank worked with me so much."
this bank is truly a work family.
Poor middle managent.
Like with many companies middle management lies and mostly threatens if you don't meet insane sales quotas.
Denies this of course then turns into a your work vs theirs.
Do not recommend.
while you are compensated fairly.
Those above you don't actual care about you as a person.
So much terrible stress placed on your to up-sell customers.
Help me.
I'm at top of scale & have not gotten my 1% increase in over 2 yrs.
I've submitted many postings with no results.
I can't live on this.
My insurance benefits are great.
Never Had Such a Great Employer.
The workplace culture is great!
Everyone know one another and you are treated as a person and not a number.
There is a strong sense of family at this company and is the foundation of everything.
this company understand that you have a life outside of work and are always willing to work with you on scheduling.
Benefits are great and PTO is best I have had compared to other companies.
Most people who work here have been with this company for years.
"Overall, a great company to work for!"
Front line workers treated unfairly.
Find another place to work.
No loyalty to long term employees.
Unethical company.
Tellers are underpaid and undervalued.
"The make the least amount of salary, but provide a valuable service to the company."
"I was told banks were cheap, but this was ridiculous."
"When before i was first hired by this company as a SAS administrator, i was a contractor."
"After i accepted the job, but before i was fulltime, this company cut my hours to 24 hours/we."
After I started fulltime this company were working me 55 hours a week (lost $ contracting and now I was salary).
That continued until June when this company hired another person this company had been promising since I started.
Never again skill
great company to work for!.
great company good pay great colleagues to work with no complaints staff and managers are very nice and amazing after awhile it is kinda like being with family
All good.
A lot of self learning.
System was a bit outdated but they were trying to improve.
They were migrating to a new software application and i left before that happened.
Micro managed to death.
Serious micromanagement in the corporate office.
"The benefits were excellent, the flexibility in schedule was decent, the pay wasn't awful the metrics required for bonuses were nearly impossible to attain."
Branch management is fantastic.
good company to work for.
Its my second time working with the company.
Great benefits including time off and 401k and pension plan.
Medical and dental and vision
Decent work/life balance but overall you are just a number.
I worked for this bank for over eleven years and yet I can sum up my thoughts on this bank with one example and just a few sentences.
"In the department where I worked, the employees were grouped into teams which usually consisted of a dozen or so people, a team lead, and a manager."
Our group of eight consultants and a team lead received a new manager after our manager retired.
"At the time, Our group of eight consultants and a team lead had each been with this bank for no less than ten years (and some over twenty)."
"Within less than two years of a new manager taking over every single consultant and a team lead left by either transferring to another department, quitting, or retiring early."
No one in upper management even noticed.
The work The work itself isn't difficult but The work itself does require a certain amount of knowledge and the training is insufficient.
"Communication between departments is chaotic and confusing and while the pay isn't terrible, raises are non-existent."
"As far as advancement, it depends on what department in this bank that you start from."
"If you begin in certain areas, no matter what degree or what experience you have you will be judged as being 'less than' and forced to advance in baby steps, often making lateral moves."
"That being said, there are opportunities to work from home and overall the job is kind to working mothers and fathers/young families."
Overall good.
Was a teller for a year and half.
Overall good experience but pay could have been better.
Enjoyed set schedule and holidays off.
Good intro into banks.
"Unless you're dead inside, find something else."
"I've put in five years at this place and have watched really good employees get fired for really bizarre reasons, such as following a directive from a superior."
"Customer abuse is rampant, which is why, unless you're adept at burying all emotions, this is not a good job."
Workplace culture.
There was no diversity at the branch I was employed at.
"Basically, there was preferential treatment towards a certain race."
this bank as a corporation must first start educating within the branches before this bank as a corporation donate anything to help the racism in America.
My branch was racist and it was brought to upper management's attention.
Would never recommend this employer.
this employer does not care about this employer's employees or are loyal to this employer's employees.
this employer hire people in at higher rates than the employees that currently worked there.
Great people to work with besides the manger..
"The overall experience is great to just get started, but like anywhere with customer service, there will be some bad apple customers."
But the manger will not have your back at all even if the manger says something the manger's way and finds it wrong at a later date or even a few minutes after and will through all the blame on you.
Claiming people come in late to work but the manger does not even open the bank on time and even with proof that you are there earlier than the manger the manger will still tell you to be earlier.
"The best way to explain is; you expect me to come into work on my computer ready to go with everything at 8:30 am, however, how am I to achieve that if you are rolling into the parking lot at 8:28 am."
It is physically impossible.
Overall very toxic.
"Also, the turn over rate in my five months working there was 8 people!"
Like how is that not a problem!
Mind you my original plan was to stay there for three years to save money and maybe even move up the latter.
Good pay and Benefits.
Good Schedule. .
The management in different branches is the biggest downfall of the company.
"The higher ups are great and very encouraging, but the lower end of management can sometimes be disrespectful and can play favorites."
"Over all, the pay for the work is outstanding as far as banking goes, and the work environment is fun within your coworkers as long as you build good relationships."
"It is important to follow the policies and to watch out for yourself, because sometimes, I did witness multiple people fired and punished for one persons mistake simply for staying quiet about a mess up."
"If you're interested in banking and finance, I would definitely recommend this bank."
The employees .
Bad place to especially the banking industry to many people leave un happy or be force to leave that the banking industry in Pittsburgh especially the contract security to much turn over
Great place.
It's a nice place to work.
They care about their employees and do what they can to keep us safe.
Would like to learn more and advance in my career as a banker.
Nice place to work .
"Amazing place to work, management is always there to help you grow in the company Really good trainings techniques"
Good benefits and compensation for all employees
Awful.
Awful.
You are just a number for sales.
They don't care about lower level employees.
Stuff rolls downhill.
Wouldnt recommend.
Sales calls at night weekly.
I enjoy my job and my title at this bank..
I enjoy my job and what I do.
My favorite aspect is being able to train and coach employees and watch them grow.
Helping them reach their goals is what makes me feel great about my job
don't recommend.
Morale horrible.
Don't care about employees.
Promotions are unlikely.
High turn over.
Cheap company.
it is about who you know.
High layoff rate.
Do not recommend
Love my job!.
I love my job.
I have started a career I know i can move in and be comfortable where i am at.
"Just wish there was an opening closer to home, but still hopeful."
get place to work.
"enjoyed the culture, management and ability to be promoted."
short staffed branches caused a stressful work situation.
hardest part of the job was managing all of the responsibilities while being short staffed
Micromanaged.
"I am not sure about the company as a whole, but my particular department was poorly managed from top to bottom."
"If you want to be micromanaged with your voice never being heard, then work here."
Don't waste your time.
The only reason I'm here is because I don't have another job yet.
The pay is horrible the work load is insane and you get paid dirt to do everything.
The system is behind in the times compared to other financial institutions.
They do not care about the safety of employees and if there is inclement weather they WILL NOT close.
Transparent and predictable.
"They are pretty transparent with the workload you'll be expected to perform, however it is a very mundane position and can only be described as unstimulating."
No work life balance.  
this bank does not care about the employees work life balance.
this bank will have you working from open to close and then complain that this bank have to pay overtime.
If you are management you can forget about having a life.
"Favoritism, Discrimination, Men compensated better women."
Unfair.
Men paid more than women.
Favoritism.
Discrimination.
Sabotage from Management .
Leadership is fake.
Whites & Hispanics always had first pick & other advantages that weren't available/options to black employees.
Severe micromanaged atmosphere.
My manager was kind.
No help when needed from support team and staff.
It's like support team and staff pass the buck from one person to another.
I should have known when the recruiter had a nasty attitude.
"The new hire Team Lead was rude, overbearing and a huge micro manager."
I barely made it through the few hours scheduled to work.
I hated being there.
Clique atmosphere.
I was the first new hire the branch had in several years.
the branch degraded everything I did and there was one woman in particular who would tell the branch manager that I was doing things that I wasn't.
It was the best decision I've ever made leaving there.
Stay away.
This company draws you in with a 'false sense of caring'
"This company will tell you This company steer about quality of life, a 'false sense of caring' they will tell you they steer about quality of life's a lie."
"The pay is abysmal, the hours are long, there is no quality of life because This company agree too busy trying to become what chase and bank of america are."
Upward mobility is predicated upon your immediate manager liking you.
Goals are only attainable if you do the impossible.
It's a modern day boiler room where you must get sales for those higher than you before you can make it for themselves.
Stay away!!
Yes.
No I do not wish to work for company any longer company lay-off to often every 3 years prepare for a lay-off
so I would never work for company again because this.
Wonderful experience.
"Wonderful people to work with, diversity..."
"Grateful, learned a lot, great customers, a very moderate work pace nost of the time, can be fast pace ever so often, attenion to detail needed all the time."
"Great Benefits, Good Team, tough place but good experience overall."
Worked very very hard here.
Long hours but got the job done.
Place was confusing at first coming from a small business (non bank person).
Learned a ton....
They Will Bleed You Dry.
During this pandemic the company assessed the value of your health versus meeting the company's projected work output.
Despite workers coming in sick the company still asserted in was best for us to come in.
Those of unable or unwilling to work were immediately dismissed.
Drama daily.
"If you are considering working for this bank Atlanta, reconsider."
So much drama in the work environment and management as a whole only cares about management as a whole.
You can never get anything resolved Because no one ever knows the answer.
They always say I have to ask someone else.
Team leads are clueless and are constantly giving you the wrong answers to questions.
If you ever complain about anything Team leads will retaliate
Good work/life balance.
"In my short time here I enjoyed not only my work environment, but also my coworkers."
We were a solid team who were always motivated to accomplish our goals and help each other succeed.
Great Work-Life Balance.
During hard times management was able to provide flexibility for my schedule to work around family life.
After a certain amount of time management provide FMLA for those who need FMLA.
Advancement within the company is also extremely simple with a lot of dedication and hard work.
Good companyp.
I worked for the company for 13 years it had its good and bad but the good definitely outweighed the bad.
I worked the graveyard shift my entire time at the company and the graveyard shift worked well for my lifestyle at the time
"Flexible schedule,."
"Greeting, provides a sense of welcome to all, and gives the Officer a chance to observe all entrants into bank branch."
Always available for Branch Manager's security needs and concerns.
Main Street Bank.
"Great culture, wonderful benefits, good team spirit."
Management cares about employees as people.
Wonderful benefit of on-site back-up day care facility in Pittsburgh.
i learned many things from there.
company gives me opportunity to practice what i learned from school about marketing and customer service.
"but, management wasn't good enough to grow up with"
Management is horrible.  
this bank is a good company to work for but the manager at this location is horrible to work for.
the manager at this location is an compulsive liar and talks about all the manager at this location's employees behind all her employees's backs to other employees.
"the manager at this location gives you nasty looks when you have a question to ask about your job, even though it is the manager at this location's job to be there for all her employees."
Worst manager ever very fake to employees and clients
Best decision I ever made..
"I have never worked for a company who provided so many options for advancement or finding the right fit and branch, whilst paying very fairly and treating employees well."
Not as incusive.
"If you have an opinion that differs with the management, you MUST keep an opinion that differs with the management to yourself!"
"the management talk a big talk of diversity and acceptance, but there is no acceptance of any view that differs from the management."
"Being in my 50's and the oldest employee in the branch, it was mentioned many times of how old I am."
"At the height of the COVID19 outbreak I found myself terminated for a procedural violation, well over a month from the occurrence."
"No coaching, warning or and disciplinary action taken, just termination."
"a procedural violation had been done by other staff, in the past were I had to coach the staff member, and the staff member are still employed."
"Finally, I was the third Teller Lead hired in the past year."
Management loves to micromanage.
Company says Company promote work/life balance and always do what's best for the client.
Definitely not true.
Want you to work 50+ hrs a week as a salaried employee and make your employees sell clients products that clients do not need or qualified to have or clients get written up... Not a good company to work for unless you want to be micromanaged.
A wonderful co to work for!💯.
This company is the best place I've ever worked!
This company is diverse and flexible and the people there are wonderful supportive and understanding!
I am going to retire from here!
Work Culture Has Changed.
"Be cautious, check current reviews."
"Excellent company in 2012-2018 with positive employee culture, and growth opportunities in a customer focused environment."
"More recent strong pressure for financial growth, limiting opportunities for customers and employees."
Hopefully this is a temporary change.
May not be applicable now.
"I worked there over 10 years and when the 2008 crash happened, they made all the employees feel expendable."
"I worked there for 6 years and it was if you can't do it, there are plenty of people that can do your job."
There are people who need work.
They slashed their commission by 33 percent and made you feel like a terrible if you called out.
I left the company for a bigger bank with a better commmision structure.
Stable Job but Takes forever to get anything done..
Any effort takes a long time to progress.
There are multiple levels of red tape that have to be cut through in departments you would not even imagine.
"this bank's overall just an okay place to work, nothing spectacular.."
I've been working at this bank for some time now and I can honestly say that I'm just ready for a fresh start with a new company.
The pay is mediocre for the level of accountability and overall sales expectations.
The incentives are not good at all.
I'm bored at my location that I work at ALL the time.
I don't want to work for a company where my promotions or advancements in the company are PRIMARILY based on sales.
Productive place to work with great teammates.
Upbeat environment that requires plenty of attention to detail and time management skills.
Consumer facing and high traffic times early in the morning and evening.
Best part of the job was helping people improve people's financial life.
Ongoing training and opportunities for advancement.  
this bank offered me the opportunity to work in a team environment encouraging me to succeed with training and motivation.
this bank also allowed to use my skills as a corporate trainer.
None.
Horrible place to work managers there is horrible and the co-worker are fake.
The area is racist you won't ever have to worry about me going back there
Wolf in Sheeps Clothing.
"A decent company to work for, good pay, great hours, good holidays."
Will hurt you if you are not liked by those around you.
"If you step out of line or say something that isn't in line, you will be thrown to the wolves."
Very much goal orientated on sales goals and calls to customers who literally don't want anything to do with you.
Not a talent base company.
No career development.
No pay increases.
No promotions.
Inexperienced managers that come and go.
Promotions are only for senior leadership.
You advance only if you know people.
Fun working environment.
I will always recommend this company to anyone because this company actually helped me grow in my scrum career.
The hardest part of the work was our daily stand-ups since we had distributed team but at the end its always enjoyable.
Pay.
"Before joining this bank I was making $18/hr with a temporary service, the recruiter for this bank position told me my pay would be close to $18/hr with shift differential this bank have gotten rid of shift differential and bonuses so my pay is $15.50"
an hr
O
I did get a .24 raise my shift is between 11-10pm I've been here over a yr now.
"my shift is still the same and there have been several newbies after I started ,back to the pay this bank have taken shift differential"
Too long for promotions.
"If you have a passion to help people on people's financial journey, this is a great opportunity."
"At any age demographic or money status, this bank has the tools to help"
"Great people, but a lack of cohesion."
Management and coworkers were excellent.
However there seemed to be very little collaboration between groups.
Overall the work was very uninspiring and unchallenging.
"Upbeat, uptempo work environment with excellent support."
My time at this bank was pleasant and exciting.
The team I worked with was supportive and helped to motivate me to exceed goals.
For the most part the compensation for the work done was competitive for the industry.
Management did an excellent job of communicating goals and changes.
this bank is always trying to feed you.
A Typical day at this bank includes being on the phones all day with your two standard 15 min brakes and one 30 min lunch which fly by.
"Time moves so slowly when your on the floor, your on the phone taking about 150 phone calls per day."
I learned a tons there your in training every other month its a lot to take in at times but you get through it.
the management is horrible there's never anyone around when you really need help and the management have no issue throwing you under the bus to save the management's behind after the management told you to do something.
(always record your conversations while with management so you don't lose your job seen countless people fired for things countless people were told to do by management)
The workplace culture The workplace culture itself is pretty good when your dealing with other employees someone is always trying to feed you.
"the hardest part of the job would be taking the back to back calls and getting yelled at by customer's and trying to keep good quality scores which is hard to do because your graded on the call you took even if its a ball call, if you don't have thick skin this is not the job for you."
You will be screamed at cursed at ect.
the most enjoyable part of the job is all the pot lucks like i said all the pot lucks love to feed you.
Not a good working culture.
"At this bank, the sixth-largest bank in the country by assets, customers can earn a up to $300 sign-up bonus with a checking, short-term savings and long-term savings combo called Virtual Wallet."
"a checking, short-term savings and long-term savings combo called Virtual Wallet come with a nice set of online management tools."
"But the interest rate on savings is low, and it takes effort to avoid monthly fees on the checking account."
Very processed.
Love that job because that job very processed and prepared everything to get ready collection sort of groups the mails then ready 10 key touch deposit into the system for the headquarter company in Philadelphia for all the companies who already pay the lease or whatever it is.
I have good reason leaving that job due move out the State of Texas
Great work life balance.  
this bank offers great work life balance.
Upward movement can require relocation depending on where you are located.
this bank offer good benefits and ok pay.
It can be a great culture provided your direct manager is good.
Worst company to work gor.
Will never return to them.
Hated banking after I worked for them.
Very rude unprofessional and unorganized company to work for.
I do not recommend banking to anyone .
banking's has a very odd culture
Meh.
Management is terrible.
I've only been here less than a year and we've already gone through 4 managers.
"Sometimes, I feel like management makes up rules as management go."
I do like the 401k and spotlight benefits though.
"The pay is mediocre as well, it's a pretty, 'Meh,' job."
100% Micromanaged.
I've been at this bank for about 3 months and not a day goes by without me thinking if I want to come to work or call out.
"The system that this bank has is extremely outdated; to get a statement, you would have to go to 3 systems to get there."
Not only is The system that this bank has outdated but so is the building and furniture.
Everything that you do here is micromanaged.
"With every customer, you have to write down every customer's name and account number for a daily debrief where management would go over their name and account number and see where you had missed opportunities to make sales."
"You always have to click the insights whenever a customer is in front of you, if not, a customer get mad."
a customer want to know why you wouldn't sell a 96 year old man a credit card.
There's also cold calls you have to do.
Upper management expect you to make 100 dials a week and have at least 2 appointments daily.
"If it's a holiday or you were sick, you have to make up those dials when you come back."
Upper management worry more about those dials than customer service.
The training is horrible.
Upper management throw you into a pack of wolves with no protection.
You learn while being on the job.
Branch support will be your best friend because no one will help you.
Branch support also expect you to know everything about banking so you're able to deliver the insights.
"Branch support would tell you to bring someone more seasoned into the conversations, but when you do, no one will reach out and you're made a fool out of yourself."
Sales goals is ridiculous.
"You would have think after the Wells Fargo controversy, Wells Fargo would cut down on the aggression of sales."
I've worked for several banks and this - more...
It's okay.
I have no comment for this company.
When I worked there I felt like this company only cared about getting sales instead of this company's customers needs and if their customers needed a personal loan or credit card or not and if their customers could afford a personal loan or credit card or not.
good but stressful.
I enjoyed the job at this bank but was taking the stress and anxiety of the job home with me and the stress and anxiety of the job was affecting my home life.
It also was becoming more about up-selling the customer to other products rather than just letting keep what the customer were comfortable with.
I was not interested in high pressure sales.
Monotonous Work.
Monotonous work with no clear career trajectory.
Vague procedures and processes.
Management does not help with providing clarity as they are unsure themselves of the correct processes.
Great place.
Loved working there.
"Many perks, respect for the employee and the employee's work environment."
Good benefits and good pay.
Have potlucks almost weekly and incentives that are amazing.
Lots of flexibility and autonomy; not much opportunity for advancement.
"In my current role, I am able to work flex hours and remotely, giving me a lot of the flexibility I desire."
"Unfortunately, apart from my manager leaving, I have no room for advancement without completely changing my career trajectory."
"It's a good place to work overall, and I don't have many criticisms aside from advancement opportunities and overall pay."
The flexibility makes up for a lot of those shortcomings though.
Great company.
"Overall this bank is a great company to work for, this bank's benefits however are not the best, you get everything but this bank are expensive and have very high deductibles that have to be met prior to you insurance paying for everything."
"The pay is also something to be desired, this bank's starting wages are great for those coming into this bank, however for those employees that have been with this bank not so much, even with job promotions you don't always get a raise with the promotion."
Flexible but with a trade off.
Best thing about this bank is the flexibility.
However you sacrifice salary and use of modern tech and practices.
this bank's speed to market is painfully slow.
There's always talk and planning about getting out of dated methodologies and tech stacks but in the 4 years I was there not much changed.
"For example, on the surface everyone gets 'Agile' training but in practice 'Agile' training's not always applied."
Good.
Working there was good.
They need to consider and employees family and personal life a little better.
Need to be flexible with employees with children.
Beware.
Most managers don't care and are very clicky.
Upper management makes promises and doesn't follow through.
Customer service makes more than this position with way less responsibility.
"Only perk is no weekends , unless mandatory overtime, and you have the opportunity to work remotely."
"No bonus, no advancement opportunities, coworkers are fake and will stab you in the back."
The company as a whole does not care about The company as a whole's employees.
HR is a joke and will miss info
They don't care about their people only their profit margins..
If I could give zero stars I would.
My manager was very close-minded and was not tolerant of others.
They often spoke of politics and their political views regardless of who they might offend.
They also berated their customers as soon as their customers had left the branch.
It was a living nightmare and I dreaded going to work each day.
I would not make that mistake again.
Ever.
"Good culture, but prone to displacement.."
Good place to work if you want to learn a lot of different things in the bank.
"Don't stay in one place too long, the raises and promotions are not great."
Inept middle management.
Managers hire based upon prior family/personal relationships and protect the under-performing staff by moving the under-performing staff to other units under Managers's supervision.
Great company.
I worked from home with this bank and had such great support for my training team to when I started with my live team.
The equipment this bank send was grear quality and the support team was very easy to work with.
I loved the hours offered and the opportunities this bank set up for advancement.
Good company.
excited to work at this bank.
good interaction with offshore and onsite.
fun environment. worked hard.
participated in complete stlc activities and lead the team
Good.
Pay is great very flexible with hours will work around school schedules if you can't handle being yelled at all day then not the job for you loved explaining things to older customers
learning experience.
The branch i was working was definitely a team.
The branch i was working are more focus on SALES than ensuring that whats fits a customer lifestyle & financial well being.
a horrible culture.
Not a great place to work.
"I would not recommend, culture is cut throat."
Lack of management.
This could be a great place to work if people would learn to respect one another and work cohesively together.
this bank is a bank.
this bank do not care about people..
Working at this bank was the worst employment experience in my entire career.
this bank does not care about this bank's people.
It was a very TOXIC environment to work in.
fast pace enviornment.
The daily work load was simple.
I assisted customers with withdraw or deposit cash and checks.
Informed customers on there bank account and offered different services and accounts we offer.
Hardest part of the job was getting referrals at times.
Would not recommend anyone to work here.
Worse company I ever worked for no stability
Worse company I ever worked for no stability don't believe in there representatives the fire for little things and don't allow a chance to defend yourself there unorganized and disfunctional rude and uninformative on what's going on very sneaky company and employees in hire up are rude and very sneaky company and employees in hire up don't care about there employees and customers complain a lot
Pleasant experience with coworkers.
All my coworkers were great to work with.
I got to meet many new personalities while working with this bank.
It is very diverse in the group of individuals this bank hire.
this bank gave me my first official job and my first official job was a pleasant experience overall.
THEE Best Job I Ever Had..  this bank gave me the skills and training needed to advance my career goals at a time when I had limited skills and work experience.
I worked at a branch where everyone was a team player and 100% supportive.
"In a world where respect, professionalism and effective communication is lacking, this bank shines like a diamond."
Nice to work with most of the people here..
Would be a great place to work but it was just a temp job.
My supervisor was the greatest.
Just did not have enough work to keep me there.
The flexibility with the work hours was good too.
High emphasis on sales in the retail branch.
Sales is the number one priority in the retail branch environment.
Emphasis is placed on workplace safety and teamwork among the branch employees.
Management was in transition when I worked there.
Professional environment place to work and business oriented..
"Business culture, optimitics, confident and companies changes."
A large capacity for job change within the company and sometimes fun place to work like any other job company.
They absolutely do not care about providing tools for their employees to provide the best service possible..
I've been in the mortgage business for 27 years and I have never seen a company where the managers absolutely ignore questions for weeks after many emails sent and leaving the clients not knowing what is going on.
The absolute most unprofessional place to work.
Good culture and environment for development..
Workplace culture is good.
Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow your career.
The company expects employees to be engaged and for everyone to be put the customer first.
Fair.
I was satisfy with my pay.
Thought it was fair enough based on my work.
Love work life balance at this bank.this bank's a great place to work at also awesome people.
Promotions.
Don't try to advance your career if your an older employee.
I was one of the regions top sales associate but regional associate was determined not to promote.
The worst place to work.
The worst place I've ever worked at in the last 10 years since I've been working.
The manager was crazy !!
under-staffed it was was horrible they want you to do more than one person work in they don't pay you for it the part time working is like full timers and don't give them benefits.
As a assistant manager there I quit after 90 days in to top it off I hurt myself in their premises lifting coins due to under-staffed.
The only good thing I can say is they have locations around the area I live.
Terrible place to work specially on the west side of Chicago.
Great flexibility.
Hard to advance.
New employees coming in makes more than current employees.
Very customer focused.
"New employees coming in should look more at the other contribution a person brings to the company for promotion, not just a person's numbers."
Good Company to work.
Good place to Work.
Lot of new technologies will be implemented.
Friendly Environment.
Enormous facility to the employees.
Lot of technologies will be implement in the employees's softwares
Productive and steady workplace..
A typical day is busy and quite soothing to be able to assist the customers.
"Although, there are numerous incoming calls, the work can be done so quickly."
They are a great company to work for..
They are a great company over all.
They care about their employees.
They care about their customers.
They give you the opportunity to advance your career and the opportunity to enjoy the work you do.
Good Company.
Goals pin workers against workers.
This makes the environment not a happy place .
Bank really don't care about there workers.
gvvvvcccplace..place to be
fair.
The company was good to work for until The company wanted us to work 6 days a week.
"The stress that working for The company has work and family balance, The stress that working for the company has work and family balance was a lie."
Upper management didn't care about employees well being.
Customers didn't feel like management cared about the branch.
Definitely needs improvement.
The location I was at is very much driven on favoritism and advancement is based off how well you are liked.
There is no support and you are thrown to the wolves with very little training.
very little training was shadowing someone for three days then going to training to learn able how this bank is viewed by others.
"Nothing to do with things like TCR jams or foreign currency,etc."
This is supposed to be soemthing you learn at the branch... but good luck with that.
Collections.
"Worked in collections while at this bank, all about hitting the numbers and producing."
Everyday was very structured managers were helpful.
Great benefits also
Good place to work.
Good place to work...culture is good...family oriented...care about employees well being.
Very detailed training and ongoing training as needed or when requested.
Regional Manager Trouble.
This would be a great place to work if it was like the company was not too far away in NJ.
Being in the Lehigh Valley has been beyond stressful and the regional manager only cares about sales and making sure the regional manager gets the regional manager's bonus.
Great opportunity.
Thai is a position of democratic responsibility customers with issues on closed accounts were directed to my department and going through every avenue to help customers with issues on closed accounts reach a closure with this bank
Bad Cultute.
"They push you through training, tell you the opposite, and then everyone at the branch acts like you're not there."
"don't support new people, and still too obsessed with 'Lobby Management' for this day and age."
"Better and easier ways to generate business, but you can't cause of micromanagement."
A great place to work.  
this bank is a great place to work the work can be difficult but everyone is very supportive.
If you mess up it's a learning opportunity not getting in trouble which I love!
this bank are very strict about sick days but HR is also very supportive for FMLA or ADA Accommodation.
Great company overall.
Great company.
Work life balance and remote positions available.
Pay is below average due broad pay brackets.
Company makes great profits but employees do not benefit from this.
Too much pressure.
No work life balance and unrealistic goals Management is too concerned with own upper mobility than doing the right thing.
Good pay but poor health benefits.
Comfortable company to settle down in.  
this bank prioritizes work-life balance in many (but not all) of this bank's lines of business.
"Working in treasury management, employees typically are in the office 40 hours / week with the flexibility to work from home as needed."
Projects are interesting and expansive as this bank is a full service bank.
Advancement occurs fluidly but salary often doesn't follow as quickly.
"These reasons make this bank a good place to begin your career or to settle into later on in your career, but not ideal to stay in with the intention to substantially boost salary"
Great company.
"There are so many opportunities within this bank, and a lot of chance to move up within this bank."
"Great benefits, and this bank are always working to improve."
Run from them.
This place is a joke.
I've worked here for 15 years.
Hard working loyal employee.
"I'm now actively looking for another job, should have done it years ago but I kept expecting This place to figure it out and do the right thing."
This place literally give you a pay decrease after factoring in inflation year on year even with exceeds expectations or better and sometimes none at all.
This place's managers are told to average out 1 to 2 percent increases for everyone and will move you and your managers evaluation of you lower to fit that (not just in pay but performance).
This place do nothing for the good of the employee beyond what This place are guilted into via industry pressures or PR.
The decisions This place make are short sighted.
HR and incompetency has convinced This place This place don't need to actually pay employees.
1+ BILLION in pure profit a quarter (that's 4 times a year) for over a decade in a row and This place don't pay This place's employees at all.
It's astounding and incredible to me this is allowed to occur.
"It's unethical, immoral, and corrupt."
I don't say these things lightly.
It hurts.
I've worked there for a long time.
I have many friends and family members that are also employed there.
Good.
I liked how family friendly this bank was.
Your need were addressed when needed.
Management was good and very understanding.
The work environment was good as well.
Company overall has great standards.
"Overall, Company is a great company."
Sometimes it is reflected in the individual departments.
"But, could use more consistency from one department to the next."
Middle/Upper Management sucks.
No development given by upper management.
Little support.
No self accountability.
No room for advancement!
the company's hire from 'outside' not within this bank.
"the company's talk about it and boast about it, but the company's's attrition rate in North Carolina is ghastly!"
Benefits?!
average 401K/pension.
Healthcare/vision/dental are very limited.
Good Leave of Absence benefits.
"Work for a year, have a baby and/or adopt and you get 6+ weeks off!"
Excellent.
Company.
"Flexibility , team work , opportunities to improve your self as a careers ."
"Employees Benefices ...,,,,,,,,,,,,, ...., ..........,,,,,,,"
the company account representative.
the company associates are cross trained to learn all aspects of customers accounts.
"However, the company is more about cross selling than customer service."
Great personalities.
The staff at the location I worked were very helpful.
"The staff at the location I worked made sure if I had any questions, that any questions were answer in a timely manner."
The staff at the location I worked work with you hands on and side by side to make sure you understand the reason for the policies.
work hard to move up and never get the chance.
"great branch mangers, i have learned so much about banking and i work hard to move up and never get the chance, hours are mostly the same until you aren't making goals then you need to work later"
Innovative.
"Open new accounts, manage a team of 10, batch and balance teller stations, operation manager of a team of 10."
"Increase sales and marketing, help customers open up loans, refer to mortgage department."
Provide customer service
Culture.
The best thing about this bank is the people and the workplace culture.
"Been here five years, this bank."
Highly recommended
Rethink choice.
"Chaotic atmosphere, unnecessary stress, no one follows up on what they're going to do, blame others for mistakes instead of using mistakes as a teachable moment"
Very Big.
"Hard to change culture, very rigid."
"The leadership changed on a monthly basis, so any new initiatives would immediately have to be changed."
Very frustrating.
Great place to start off in the financial industry.
Great people to work with and help each other in increasing sales by observing each others' conversations with the customers and making suggestions where needed.
Not diverse.
Limited advancement in certain markets.
Unrealistic work expectations.
"Multiple demands, most are often unreachable."
They claim they are diverse and inclusive but they aren't.
Be forewarned about meeting ticket quotas.
"The main emphasis in the IT group is to complete as many work request tickets as possible, otherwise you are out the door."
"Regardless if the work ticket is extremely detailed or very simple, the IT group are focused on the number of tickets you complete during the course of a days work."
"The ones who are judging you have no concept of how detailed the work requests can be, and make the ultimate decision that you are gone."
Not a professional work environment.
Be warned!
"Mostly fun workspace, but can get stressful."
"The overall environment of this bank is pretty laid back, but sometimes meeting numbers along with all other responsibilities can seem impossible and quite stressful, especially when numbers along with all other responsibilities keep changing or adding more and more!"
I would recommend this bank as a short-term workplace.
"this bank pays well and has great benefits, but I would not necessarily recommend this bank as a longtime career if you aren't a work-a-holic!"
Prod Mgr.
The management at this bank cares about this bank's employees.
Some areas offer more flexibility with workload and location.
"Management encourages development, and teammates like to help each other succeed."
Regional Bank Technology stack with the desire to be the next 'Big Bank'.
"The people at this bank are The people at this bank's best asset, but The people at this bank's technology leaves much to be desired."
"The best part of the job is being able to work from home, but even though leadership tout being 'inclusive', leadership makes decision without input from staff."
Poor overall communication.
Great place to work.
I've had a wonderful experience with this bank.
The work life balance is phenomenal.
Being able to move up in time is also a great option.
I love having options for career growth.
No complaints.
Leadership.
Exposed to innovative technology stack.
"Enterprise is moving towards micro-service, modern architecture."
Agile and DevOps cultural changes are getting matured
Great place to start a career in financial services..
"The pay is adequate, the benefits package is better."
The corporate culture is supportive and pushes employees to pursue advancement within the company.
"The branches however, lacked staffing making it difficult to complete any job duties."
Job has to be #1.
"If your job is your only priority, work here."
Otherwise find somewhere else.
"If you want call nights and selling, this is the job for you."
I enjoyed the people I worked with but selling and being the smallest branch and trying to carry the entire region for goals was too much.
Be warned.  
this bank is a place you may not want to consider.
"Stressful nights to meet efficiency goals, while not making any errors."
10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch that doesn't give you enough time to get something to eat and relax.
"If you go over at least a minute, you would be penalized for it."
Only thing enjoyable was the people and the pay.
Productive working environment.
The environment was great.
coworkers were very nice.
Had an amazing manager that cared a lot about employees and it gave out a great working environment.
Don't do it!.
I never felt more about place in my life.
"this bank always has openings in the Fayetteville area because people quit, it's hard to get promoted."
Management only worries about how many credit cards you get everyday.
Regional manager will do 'training on the spot' in front of your coworkers and not give any sort of constructive feedback.
"Be aware that if you work for this region your personal life will be expected to put on second, business is always first."
Vacation time will be approved if and only Reginal Manager approves Vacation time.
you cannot trust anyone.
I worked for this bank for 5 years.
The regional manager made everyone miserable.
If The regional manager did not like you you were marked to get fired.
I was harassed.
"Eventually, The regional manager asked me to input a clients ID to issue new debit card even though clients did not have clients's ID with clients, because this bank 'KNEW' clients as a customer."
I was reluctant but at the managers insistence issued clients a new debit card anyway.
Of course I was then fired.
WHAT A JOKE AND WASTE OF 5 YEARS.
this bank is.
"GREAT company to work for..  this bank is a Great Company to work for, but the upper management with the Atlanta base lockbox leaves the site open to untrustworthy managers."
You then lose good employees and bad moral becomes an everyday reminder.
Your team feels this is just a job and are afraid to speak up.
Pretty decent.
It was a pretty decent job just make sure you stay on your P's and Q's's very strict your P's and Q's will terminate you without question The calls were back to back your basically busy 24/7 needed more down time not enough breaks
Very family oriented workplace with extremely great work/life balance feel..
The best company I have worked for in all of my years.
It was very easy to progress to other positions and every manager was fully invested in personal growth.
Industry is highly demanding.
Ever changing rules and laws make performance expectations somewhat unrealistic.
Constant pressure to hit goals with many variables impeding you.
Positive.
"Really good place to work most days, but some days can be tough."
It can get really busy at the beach I work at and become really stressful because of this.
Also customer can be hit or miss.
"team spirit, productivity and opportunity for growth."
Comfortable work environment.
Good communication and relationship with both employees and clients.
Management quarterly reviews provides opportunity for self assessment.
Employee respects each other and are willing to giving a helping hand at any time.
Avoid This Position.
The people in This Position are horrible..
The people in this position tell you are able to ask questions if you need help and then when you do you are told by the manager that the people don't know your job because they are separate divisions within your job.
The the manager and team lead are just wishy washy and backstabbing people!
Stressful.
"As a customer service rep, you take an average of 50 70+ calls per day."
The calls are back to back with little to no down time.
"You do have managers and supervisor with you during every shift, but at times it can be difficult to get a hold of one of managers and supervisor to assist with you during your call."
"You are rated and scored with each call that can make assisting customers somewhat stressful, because customers don't want you on each call too long but what customers needs met."
It is a very stressful balancing act with each situation.
There is on going training and team meetings that you need to attend.
team meetings that you need to attend are not long enough to cover all the questions that other team members may have for clarification to assist customer efficiently.
Fun job.
Exciting people to work with.
Customers appreciate the flexibility of doing loans via phone.
Offered flex time off each quarter that wouldn't count against time off unexplained
Overall.
Overall this bank is an awesome company and cares genuinely about the employees.
The managers are HORRIBLE .
And not just one or two I have networked with a lot of different branch managers and have seen how different managers manage there teams.
different managers are NOT team players AT all.
different managers only care about different managers and different managers's results and different managers expect you to do your job and different managers.
this bank have different opportunities as far as promotion and advancement but manager are envious of employees that excel better than this bank.
Horrible place to work!.
Exempt employees are expected to work 50-60+ hours per week because hourly employees cannot.
Senior management at Brecksville/Pittsburgh Lending facility is inexperienced and/or unconcerned with customers or employees.
"Corporate bullish!$. The higher ups at this bank only care about customer satisfaction, and making money."
The higher ups at this bank say this bank are not like other big banks but that is not true.
High pay isn't worth it.
Taking a pay cut to seek other employment.
"There are surveys that go out to customers, that can make or break your bonuses."
"There's been times this bank've received bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry people who are just angry they can't get their way can't get people who are just angry they can't get their way's way, and bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry they can't get their way's tanked this bank's bonuses that this bank received and earned."
people who are just angry they can't get their way want you to kiss every customers butt and people who are just angry they can't get their way do it at the expense of people who are just angry they can't get their way's employees.
The pay is great but The pay's the only thing and people who are just angry they can't get their way use The pay as means to secure you in the job.
No progress to move up and under paid!!.
Staffing from management always implement moving up the ladder but in realistic world Staffing from management don't want you to go anywhere else in the company if your good at what your currently doing
Great co-workers and work-life balance
.
Some management needs less chaos..
Great work environment with flexible work arrangements.
Pay could be more competitive.
"My job is seemingly quite secure, but I do see other 'production environment' departments ebb and flow with personnel as the market determines. ."
"Tellers and bankers make about the same, the only differences is on the incentives."
overall it been a great experience.
I started as a teller and made to universal branch specialist/ assistant manager in a universal branch withing 4 years.
Very good place.
The managers really cared about your growth and are always willing to lend a hand.
"The managers pay is kind of low for the work being done, but overall a great company."
"this bank seems to lack a corporate culture that promotes the inclusion and advancement of blacks and latinos..  this bank, especially in the Greater Philadelphia market, must do a better job of recruiting, developing and promoting black people."
Implicit bias is a company wide challenge the needs to be addressed in a deliberate and focused way.
"In a majority minority city like Philadelphia it seems odd that there are so few senior and executive leaders of color, in particular black people in meaningful leadership roles where black people can make hiring/firing decisions."
Stay away.
This company changed from the time I started working there until the time I left.
This company no longer have a vision for the mortgage industry and did not value experience or quality.
The focus is not on the customer.
Good place over all to work.
I'm currently employed at this bank and overall enjoy my job!
My only complaint is the way the proceedures and training is handled .
Like most I would like to see the income be more inline with other banks and credit unions.
Diverse loving group!.
I guess my experience was different than the rest.
I have an awesome group of coworkers that became a second family to me. 0010745 was the best decision for me!
The manager made sure I was always trying to reach my goals!
"My coworkers weren't only worried about my work life, but also worried about my personal life."
"I think we all grew together, while employed there."
I would recommend my hoem beach to anyone!
Great company to work for.
Trust me I would know.
Better than the other Banks.
Great company to work for.
I worked for an agency on a contract but still treated fairly.
"Worked for several Banks, this bank is definitely the leader as far as how this bank treat employees"
Pay is decent management is ehh.
"Management isn't great, pay and benefits are good."
Maternity leave and paternity leave is AMAZING.
Probably the only PLUS to working at this bank.
Could use management improvements
"Productive, professional workspace."
"I may be the wrong person to ask about this, because I am actively seeking to leave employment with this bank, although this bank have been good to me"
"and I have made many meaningful connections and have learned so much in my time there, I have grown the need to seek change."
Good.
Many positions in the bank.
I enjoyed working in retail not in commercial lending.
Mostly great management.
I learned many different field in the company and I have grown in my career
don't work at bank unless you have no other option.
"The staff was great, but the position its self was incredibly boring."
I felt as if I was losing brain cells every time I went to work.
this bank has ancient technology in this bank's branches which makes you want to pull your hair out.
Awful stay away.
"Bottom line you are a machine here, your not a person."
If you decide to work here be prepared that everything is micromanaged and there is no way for you to be imperfect
Great place and challenging projects.
Love this company.
One of the best I have worked with.
Would recommend it to colleagues and friends.
Challenging and productive environment with great work-life balance.
Corporate management cares little about employees.
The only thing that matters is profit..
I would never recommend this as a place to work.
"Expectations are unrealistic, cuts are made with low level employees, no such thing as company loyalty or job security, Corporate management talk about employee engagement but sow seeds of fear and uncertainty..."
I could go on.
Give time to learn to employees.
"Manager was unprofessional, coworker was unprofessional, in the mid time they go home and do your laundering and after come back in branch , costumer service was bad out side ATM they was not consider service with customer and coworkers and Manager are raciest and they behaved with new people with very bad my experience was very bad with this bank I think this bank have to focus in internal management."
Modern Cutting Edge Office with Great People.
The people at this bank are a reason to stay.
I felt my team truly cared about me as a person and wanted to see me succeed.
The office space was comfortable and made it easy to get work done.
"HR has policies in place HR made it difficult to advance financially or by title, but aside from that I think this bank is a great company to work for."
A day at work.
Finding solutions for clients financial needs and helping balancing clients's everyday money management limits on a daily basis.
"Opening accounts, loan applications, mortgage referrals."
Has is positives and negatives.
I have mixed reviews.
"I like working for the company and although the company promote working to get you a better position, some management doesn't seem to try or care."
"Also, you don't get paid for the work you do beyond the basics."
And sometimes not even that.
"There is no raises and during the 'year end reviews', the 'year end reviews' are minimal, if at all."
just a job.
I did customer service same as any other call center in Columbus Ohio.
"it is kind of like a high school environment, a lot of gossip and child play."
but as long as you go to work and do your job you should be fine
Average.
Excellent colleagues.
Difficult to advance upward or to other departments.
Sales and management functions take over the job without much support.
Tough work/life balance.
They just want someone to be the front line fall guy.
They have a very 'take ownership' attitude so you can't say anything along the lines of 'it's our/ this banks policy'.
Your basically getting berated all of the time by customers or managers who want you to sell even though you aren't in sales.
Good: Pay Bad: constant concern with downsizing as an employee.
"My day consisted of managing staff, monitoring reports, working with HR, hiring/firing/laying off staff, monitoring for improvements or concerns within processes and meetings with upper management and other management."
"Mostly alright, nothing exciting."
Good job with great hours but very monotonous
"and once you learn something, you are responsible for taking care of it."
Time off is discouraged.
Must be dependable and show up every day.
Strict attendance policy.
Culture has changed'; many employees are leaving.
Upper management hires lower managers based on favoritism.
"lower managers then leave this bank, as there is no room for growth."
"With the sales managers leaving, bankers under their supervision then leave as well."
There should be many openings at this bank because so many people are leaving.
A recruiter with a conscience would not direct a candidate to this bank.
Living with this salary impossible.
Salary to low for tellers as tellers are the face of the company.
tellers are the first people customers see and many times offend.
tellers do a lot of work and maybe have one of the highest pressure/stressful related job.
A great company to work for.
I really enjoyed working for this bank.
It allowed for many learning opportunities and career advancement.
I would definitely recommend working at this bank to anyone interested in this field.
Working at this bank Call Center.
this bank Call Center was a new a fun experience that I enjoyed being apart of.
Being given this opportunity allowed me to advance my customer service and banking experience while also creating new relationships with coworkers and customer.
this bank Call Center is a huge banking company that also provide the services to help start my career in the financial industry.
Horrible company.  
this bank does not care about this bank's employees.
this bank's management team is awful and focuses solely on Their management team.
The sales culture this bank push on this bank's employees creates a stressful work environment.
It's constant conversation on how you are going to improve while Their management team continue to not help customers or follow through on Their management team's word.
this bank do not pay you enough and if you get promoted the easier is a joke.
this bank pay more to new hires then this bank do to current employees.
WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO WORK HERE OR BANK HERE.
Good.
Was good experience
and they are great company if you like to work for this bank go four it don't wit do it
I love this bank this bank's great company I life the job for my kids
"Many different locations to work from, including remote.."
Workplace enjoyment and satisfaction depends largely on what department and manager you have.
"Some departments embrace a philosophy of growth and change, while others are content with the status quo."
Okay.
I was not necessarily an indivisible for the overarching company.
My branch was wonderful but the overarching company did not care about me or the staff I worked with.
The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet..
"If you want to work among the most arrogant, self-important snobs who have no education or pedigree to back it up, go join The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet..."
"The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet..'s model is a mess, The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet.. pretend to be ultra high net worth when The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet.. are barely mass affluent The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet.. care nothing about the client and only care about The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet..'s fees."
fees when all The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet.. care about is The absolute worst wealth management firm on the planet..'s
Easy going yet professional work environment.
Great company with opportunity for growth.
Pay is moderate but good sales incentives.
Environment is dictated by manager.
Mentor ship is available along with coaching
Horrible.
Horrible management not a place that would ever recommend to anyone.
Horrible management do not care about you as a customer.
It's all about the bottom line.
It's about making money and nothing else.
Disappointed in this bank by management this bank hire.
Disappointed in this bank by the Management this bank hire.
this bank usually are experienced.
this bank has great training.
There are a lot of banking rules you are unaware of until you work there
productive fun and great.
"clear plan for the future, employees don't know long-term goals, just i need to move from the place to bay area the for big IT opportunity for more growing"
This is as far the best bank i have ever worked for.
Your manager want you to succeed and take opportunities to advance and train in other departments.
Also after 6 months of employment you will have the opportunity to transfer to other departments and the training you will gain.
offers full time and it's nice to have all bank holidays off.. Was a decent job that helped me learn a lot.
"I worked for a total of 2 different branches, and had volunteered to several other branches in the area during my time employed there."
I had a pretty good experience with this bank..
"I was a this bank teller, I enjoyed the environment and training."
I learned a lot really fast and believe the way it was taught was very easy to retain.
Going on four years.
The thing that got me hooked right away was the team and family atmosphere.
Their goal is to coach you up and not down.
They push you to be the best you can be on a daily!
That's why I am still there
Enjoyable work place.
"You're given 15 minutes before actually required to take a call, this gives employees time to catch up on important company alerts and communications."
"Though there are productivity measures that seem to be priority in each meeting, productivity measures that seem to be priority in each meeting also explain the importance of taking a break and getting time to mentally recharge."
Management is helpful and willing.
I was in a high paying position but downgraded unfairely.
If I had the necessary management support from beginning I feel I would not have been unfairly downgraded.
Insurance is great and there are several benefits but now incentives will be discontinued and pay will increase more
Sales driven company.
"If you're not familiar with having sales goals, this is not the company for you."
"The micromanage is unbelievably insane, and upper management talks down on employees."
Not to mention the pay is far from great.
If your supporting a family this job will not pay enough.
Quality work environment with balance.
Good company where you can use your experiences to venture out and try different parts of the company.
You get out what you put in.
"Lots of well established, nice co-workers to help you progress through your career."
Good place to work but.
The job was good.
I started as a part-time teller and within six (6) months I was being offered the Teller Supervisor position.
The problem was the pay was very low.
The managers and co-workers were all nice and helpful.
My only issue was the very low pay.
Sales Driven Company.
Turnover is extremely high here.
this bank is a strong sales driven company.
Goals are pushed daily and plans are made to achieve Goals.
Bonus are strictly reflective of sales and performace.
Sales Driven.  
this bank is an excellent company to work for if you are Sales driven and are able to meet sales quotas.
In my opinion this bank values this bank's sales over the client/customer service experience.
I was able to incorporate my love of teaching financial wellness to this bank's customers which didn't always lead to a sale and this was not always accepted even if it was right for the customer.
frowned
Perfect First Job.
This was my first job out of college.
Working with this bank provided much of the support and guidance needed after completing your education.
There are so many avenues across the business/financial services one can provide.
Working here demands a lot of patiences to see your results grow.
Department reminded me of high school cliques.
I worked only in one department; I don't want to condemn entire institution.
I enjoyed the fast pace of the work.
It was a production driven atmosphere.
"The quality and quantity of work should have been most important, but the fun timers whose outside activities (such as whether one drank alcohol, or was a movie fan, or a gamer) were kind of held to a lesser standard."
Glad I no longer work there.
It was very stressful.
Great job.
I actually loved working for this bank!
Unfortunately I did have to leave due to location being a big problem for me!
But any one who gets hired into this bank it's such a great job
Sales Job.
Like any job there are pros and cons.
Be prepared to be in a high paced sales environment.
You be required to make suggestions to customers and businesses about products and services.
I don't agree with the sales culture.
"Very sales driven, feels like your spinning your wheels at times, you've never sold enough."
Always meeting with managers to see how you can sell more.
Think again.
They expect you to push products on everyone even those who clearly don't need products.
I was put on warning for not offering to a 86yr old customer.
Pay is not good when you think about what you bring home monthly.
Management pushes everything on the team and still expects you to finish your work.
"Let me not start on the racist, sexist policy."
Go anywhere else you'll be so much better off.
productive.
Helps employee to succeed.
Give time to employee to work on there pace.
Where employee need help management is there for employee.
The company helps to maintain work and life balance.
this bank is company that values diversity and inclusion.  
this bank places high value on this bank's reputation and moderate risk philosophy.
this bank also place high value on keeping this bank's customers and employees safe and happy.
Current employee.
"It's not a bad place to work but morale is pretty low at the moment due to large queue sizes, mismanagement by executives who don't know how to do our job but are trying to save money."
All of which causes bad work life balance.
"Also wages aren't competitive with other companies, we do the job of three and get paid much less for one"
Productive.
"Enjoy working with my team, learned a lot, great work experience, very cooperative team and manager, it was a great feeling to release customers financial stress and to make customers happy."
large bank.
Continue to provide the level of service as if you are a small community bank.
Philanthropy is a major piece of working at this bank.
Top notch training.
Very good management
Professional and well organize environment for qualify employees.  
this bank is a wonderful company to work and to learn.
I am so benefit from leaving and working at this bank.
I feel I have growing up together with my working knowledge and experiences from this bank.
"productive,team oriented and funny individual..."
"A typical day at work would start by updating the team lead on the progress of the task assigned to each team member,this was always conducted in a meeting of testers for example if you are writting test cases and you realize a requirement is not clear,it was a platform to present any obstacle with regards to your work assignment,i also had an opportunity to act as a Team Lead and this was another exciting challenge at work interms of management from implementation of Agile methodies as a scrum master,reporting,assigning duties and setting timeframe for the assigned work.."
"Team work was ineviteable culture nobody wanted to ignore,a failure for a single person would cost the whole team so we encouraged the spirit of consultation whenever you needed any help."
The hardest part of the job is while reporting the deffects there would always a tag of war between testers and developers.and the most enjoyable part is when you identify major deffects in an application.
Great place to work.
"An amazing company that you could just find yourself working at for the rest of your life, extremely good benefits."
I would recommend anyone to apply there.
Worst company I ever worked.
Manager don't know how to treat an employee.
Manager offten treat you like you are nobody.
Manager are full of promises that Manager are not going to fullfill.
Don't work with Manager EVER!!!
Manager don't know anything and then treat you like a dum person.
Shame on Manager.
Great place of employment.
"You could andvance in your career very quickly, they always want you to succeed."
They are team players.
They pay fairly and the managers will have meetings throughout the month to see what it is you want to do and put you on the path.
poor management.
"company is a sales driven environment before was more customer service based, management was terrible wouldn't recommend working for this company."
would rather be in prison.
Ok work environment.
Ok place to work bad shift room for advancement changes all the time no more in office only work from home must have private space for work where door can lock
I miss working for this bank.
this bank pay really well.
"But you have to be sure to that option this bank the hours that you want and if need be, wait until that option becomes available or you may be stuck."
Great company.
Worked here for 4 years and loved it.
"Great culture, work environment and they had exceptional benefits/PTO."
Only reason I left was because of family health issues
Very informational place to work.
I started my career at this bank.
I learned all about how banks operate and the structures of the various industries banks work with.
this bank has been a great place to start my career.
Favouritism.
Lots of favoritism.
"It's all about WHO you know , it doesn't matter how hard you work or what your numbers are."
Different policies depending on regions and no consistency what so ever.
Promotion is for their favorite only!
Doesn't matter the experience.
You really have to tip toe and watch your back.
The company The company itself is good but it's a matter of luck where you will end up being.
It helps if you know someone.
Worked in collections for 4 years.
The management constantly changed and know one thought of the real business needs to concerned with metrics and etc.
this bank.
It was a nice work environment and pay was very well.
It was a new program so there were some kinks that needed worked out but the people were wonderful.
this bank Review.
"The work is rewarding, the support of work processes are both smart and efficient."
The environment is racist and bias.
"I was harrassed, assaulted, phone menaced, and reported these actions and was ostracized and mistreated as a result."
The systemic bias in their culture is problematic.
Absolutely stressful environment.
I was as a QA test lead in this bank(TCoE).
I am going to tell you my experience with this bank(TCoE) and my experience with this bank's just my subjective opinion.
"Onboarding and off boarding process is awful, no KT or directing new employee to the right work flow."
It is imposible to find any documentation related to the project.
Poor weak hardware laptop is proveded for automation with Windows 7 (later upgrated to 10) system which is glitching periodicaly.
Scrum master's's answer is 'Scrum master's don't know' for any question.
Management system is in very unprofessional level and not orgonized.
Developers' manager doesn't understand overall concepts of developing and hiring devs with backend background for frontend project.
"A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing, more truly, A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing come to have A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing's lunch, drink coffee/tea, and wash A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing's dishes afterall."
"There is no proper environment for testing, everything should be tested in devs' machine which is unstable and available from time to time."
So many mess is in whole Sprint duration.
Releases are constantly postponed due to other dependencies.
this bank(TCoE)'s new up to date web application cannot emerge because of all these kind of issues in management.
If you try to open this bank's new up to date web application you will see old design which is even not responsive.
I wonder whether the stakeholders aware about the lame this bank application.
I can continue to criticize every detail of this bank working process for a long time but want to say this bank manager could fire employee for no reason even everything is done on time and properly.
Instead of appreciation employee could get fired or get stress.
Would not recommend.
Not to bash them just think there a plenty of places you could be and make process and money and not feel like someone is against you and was to slow you down.
Lots of Turnover.
"Due to the quality of work and the environment at this bank, there has been a substantial amount of turnover since I started."
"Moreover, there does not appear to be any change coming to improve employee morale."
West orange northfield branch management was the worst.
I've been in the career of banking for roughly 6 years.
I've NEVER experienced such poor leadership in my life to compare to the one in this branch.
I've never had a manager tell me to my face 'the business comes before you' when I express a concern of lack of work/life balance in the workplace.
"Due to my recent life event changes of me having to move to a different state, I applied to this bank."
"When I arrived to my interview 15 minutes early we'll prepared after driving for 2 hours from my hotel to get there, I was told to wait an additional 30 minutes after my scheduled time because The branch manager wasn't ready."
The branch manager was completely unprofessional.
The branch manager told me The branch manager's 'stretching my interview longer' within 10 minutes of my interview by adding unnecessary conversation because i told The branch manager of my drive time.
"On my drive back, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job after I clear for drug testing."
Flash forward to me actually working at this branch...
"I was expected to work 6 days a week (some leave this branch at 7pm some nights)M-S, wear a suit, reach high sales goals, be a banker, be a teller... etc."
the job is do-able.
"But when management is constantly over your shoulder, throwing mini tantrums when things don't go management's way, disrespecting management's colleagues..."
it makes you not want to come to work.
"After I wasn't told lunch breaks were 45 minutes not an hour, I had The branch manager CALL ME WHEN IM OFF THE CLOCK 50 minutes into my break to ask me to come back in."
There's no space.
And the fact that management didn't allow me to continue doing training & jump into - more...
Too much stress for mediocre pay.
Tellers were required to meet sales quotas that are unattainable.
If you didn't meet the quota you would receive written warnings even if you had done everything to try to meet sales quotas that are unattainable.
The pressure they put on employees is over the top.
Great place to grow.
Great place to work.
Every day is different.
Fast pace and could be stressful but not unbearable.
"As an employee you must own your career, management is there to help and coach through out the way."
Great place.
I could not have been happier with my time at this bank.
"this bank is highly committed to this bank employees and goes above and beyond to both train, as well as guild it's employees."
Team work.  
this bank has an excellent training opportunity before taking live service calls.
this bank have an excellent lead team support in every department.
I really enjoyed working for this bank.
I miss bank
N. I loved my position at this bank.
I miss my position at this bank a lot!
But family took priority.
So unfortunately I had to leave after nearly 11 years.
I loved my coworkers!
"If you ain't engaged, get out of the room.."
"Work is only fun if the team is engaged which makes the customers engaged, which in turn gets you more excited to do your job ="
More Money
=
Hopefully all customers give you 5 star reviews!
=
"If you get anything lower, you Bonus disappears = Trash."
Summary: Compared to other banks...
"Little Money, A lot of work, benefits are great, bonuses are fantastic (only if you get 5 star reviews), and bonuses train you really well."
"I mean, REALLY WELL."
Decent.
Varies.
Some leadership is better than other.
Some pay favorites.
Not always acknowledged for work completed.
Stressful.
Not always fair with all employees
One of leading banks.
•
Analyzed varied and complex transactions/processes utilizing standard and non-standard procedures.
• Identified financial risk of potential fraud.
Carefully review documentation provided by customers.
• Checked replies to One of leading banks's customers disputes quality through e-OSCAR system.
Branch sales & service associate.
stressful environment with multitasking.
"Management needs to improve, only cares about Management's numbers."
Definitely need better manager who also has interest in Management's employees success.
Was lead to believe the Job was something else.
I interviewed for a completely different job.
"While the title and description remained the same after I was hired, the actual job a completely different job was entirely different than what I was lead to believe."
"If I had known beforehand what I was going to be doing, I never would have accepted the Job."
Productive and great place.
Really good job that teaches you a lot when it comes to everything that you do not know much about.
The training is very well organized and makes things a lot easier.
Na.
Great place to work and great coworkers.
My manager was always very thoughtful and helpful and the customers were great as well.
Would recommend this job.
Job Duties are not as advertised or applied for leading to zero job satisfaction and career development support..
Job Duties are not as advertised or applied for leading to zero job satisfaction and career development support.
The this bank group I worked for made lots of promises but failed to fulfill most of lots of promises.
It's like the book 1984.
Over the time I've been here the level of micromanagement has steadily increase.
Things are mandated by corporate that way.
They have a department that does nothing but listen to your phone calls.
You have multiple meetings that produces no results throughout the week.
You never get consistent information from the people who are supposed to be there to assist branch employees.
If you like to be able to think for yourself a department that does nothing but listen to your phone calls is not the place for you.
Great culture.
Better than most competitors.
The goals are lofty but attainable.
The customer service focus and putting them at the center of all the bank does.
The internal tech is lacking.
"challenging, fun."
"This was my second time to work for them, very good company to work for."
"They are very driven by sales and customer care, sales and customer care are some of the most important things to excell at if you want to succeed."
Great place to work for until I got displaced because of business changes.
The mortgage industry goes up and down and you cannot control how the business have to displace and hire.
Overall the business were family oriented and provided time off as needed.
Sounds great/ not great once you get there.
Told one thing before you start then it's not at all the way they said it would be.
Bonus scale is a joke.
They skew math to off set and calculate survey results to NOT pay you bonus.
Management let's platform staff literally steal referrals (also bonus related for tellers) from tellers.
And does nothing to support teller staff when happens over and over.
Blatantly/favors lets bankers work bankers's own schedule.
It's gross.
Loved this job!.
I loved working at this bank.
The working environment was challenging and rewarding.
I learned a lot about banking and Loss Mitigation process.
I would have liked to been trained in more areas.
"Strongly professional, integrity oriented company.  "
"this bank is a highly respected, customer focused bank that provides a positive workplace culture which encourages employees to be the best in the industry."
poor management and HR.
Management was asking staffs to break written guidelines.
Also upper management had upper management's favorite managers and treated their favorite managers differently than other managers.
"The goals and expecations are unattainable, typically over 55% of the branches don't obtain over 55% of the branches's goals."
Fast Paced Day.
Start off checking prior and current day emails from our service partners.
Then open excel to prepair the Daily spreasheet containing our IDDAs.
Next would come time for the teams morning Huddle.
Then back to working the entries up to the 2pm deadline.
"Workplace with opportunities for improvement, cultural change necessary."
The overall environment was varied based on where you were working and what work you were completing.
training was lacking in some areas and high management turnover.
"Enjoyed the work, overall."
Bigger isn't Always Better....  
this bank has grown into a super regional Bank.
From the Retail Banking viewpoint this bank have too many layers of management or people you have to answer to.
"There is a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager."
"a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager expect you to not only help a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager hit a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager's goals, but also attend numerous sales meetings (virtual and in person) that are generally not helpful."
"a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager are closing Branches, yet direct any customers with problems encountered from phone/ email contact to any customers with problems encountered from phone/ email contact's local Branch."
"Not a bad culture, but a Regional manager, Market Manager along with Sales and Service Manager, Loss Prevention Manager, Business Manager, Investment Manager and Merchant Services manager expect miracles with thin staffing."
Bloated back offices: analysts and IT could be outsourced to beef up the front line offices.
Amazing Company.
The company was amazing.
I loved my time here.
It was time for me to move on to different opportunities given some changes in my life and I was sad to leave but every employee was amazing to work with.
es muy facil hablar con tu jefe siempre tiene tiempo.
me gusto mucho trabajar con ellos es otra forma de ver los negocio y tienen un criterio muy amplio lastima que el dólar varioconsulto y casi
no tengo operaciones ya que le tienen un poco de temor a una devaluacion
New employee.
I was a new employee and my onboarding was very bad.
Very stressful.
Lack of training on policy and procedures.
No mentor.
Sink and swim training.
Good.
Had a very good working experience and learning new things in Salesforce application.
Senior management was very co-operative and accomodative in understanding the changing dynamics.
In house management seemed undertrained.
The experience I had at this company was initially good.
Then the new branch manager came in and created a hostile work environment.
the new branch manager pushed us in the wrong ways and created hostility among the lowest paid workers.
the new branch manager promised training and advancement then put delays on co-workers rather than making clear the circumstances of delays.
Misunderstandings that could have been prevented turned into employee conflicts.
the new branch manager gossiped with certain employees and clients and was generally unprofessional.
Wonderful place to work all around.
Great people.
Very professional atmosphere.
I moved to California or I'd still be working here.
Management is top-notch.
If I move back to Michigan I'll apply here again for sure.
Training is very thorough and the office is clean.
I enjoyed working at this bank.
I enjoyed working at this bank.
he culture was very supportive and the people were enjoyable to work with.
I would definitely work at this bank again in the future and would recommend others working there both as a current job and future career.
Great place to work.
"I love working at this bank, and the environment."
I've been able to move to different areas and expanded my knowledge very quickly.
I started it on credit cards then was soon able to go to sales and I am now a loan analyst.
Branch Sales & Service Associate- underpaid and not appreciated.
"My time spent with the company was unorganized, unprofessional and extremely stressful."
My management was not supportive of my career or growth with the company.
When I was contacted by the recruiter there was no negotiating pay.
I personally took a serious pay cut taking this position.
14K per year...
You will be required to stay weekly for call night every Monday an hour later to try to build your book of business and clients.
And also once a month on Wednesdays 2 hours later to build your investment and retirement clientele.
Good company to work for.
"Good company to work for, excellent benefits package."
Work/life balance extremely important.
Great inclusive culture.
Good training program to set you up for success.
Great People with Good Goals.
"Great pay with few drawbacks, only downside would be potential staffing issues (under-staffing) or bad hours due to late shifts."
"Overall a great place to work, if you don't mind selling."
great.
"great place to work, love the environment."
"learned closing loans, management skills, hardest part was clients, and making calls,."
i love the team work.
Company is respectable.
"The company is ok to work for, there are multiple opportunities to move up if you are in the right department."
Unfortunately the department I was in this is not possible.
Overall good place to work..
it's a good place to work with bankers hours so you have a set in and out time.
customer satisfaction has really decreased due to a high turn over rate which puts pressure on workers to meet set sales goals
Okay for a living.
"this bank started off good, but as time went on, this bank started becoming a lot like Wells Fargo before this bank hit rock bottom."
Nonstop pressure for referrals.
Pay not great.
"Not very easy to advance, you have to have a good word in."
People treat you unfairly.
Employees are so stressed over meeting goals Employees are starting to do things Employees shouldn't just to meet goals.
It's getting bad at this bank.
Family comes first.
"Good flex time hours and amazing management on location, gained valuable experience and everyone there is friendly and helpful."
"Professionals, teamwork makes the dream work...."
It was a nice place to work for before they started trying to be competitive.
They do have great products and pitch as far as a bank goes.
The vacation time is reasonable and the work culture is pleasant at times.
"However, when it comes to hiring managers there should be a more extensive background."
The assistant managers are not well trained in how The assistant managers can manage others of all backgrounds and cultures in addition to not being dependable.
The pay should also be increased for the amount of paper work that is done within a branch atmosphere.
Why does a billion dollar company use so much paper?
"We are not in high school, meaning management should not micro manage because of the sales pressure management feel from management's management and then put that energy onto management's staff."
Productive work environment..
Good place to work.
Management was not on the same page across the board.
Management's a place of high energy.
Management's an exciting place to learn about banking.
I enjoyed the position.
I would have liked to see management a little more involved.
long days.
at this company this has to be something that you really want to do.
the work is different its the same thing ever day depending on your position.
i will say if you are a people person and willing to stick it out you will like it and will stick around for a chance to grow in this company.
A good company to work for.
"A good company to work for good benefits, excellent compensation for days off."
lots of job opportunity and excellent maternity leave along with excellent child care assistance
Training.
On your own for training and fellow employees were to busy to help!
you had and old manual and and old manual is what you had to reference.
Management had no time for meetings or getting to gethter weekly.
Great workplace and lot of opportunities to learn.
Participating in Agile ceremonies and project delivery.
Implementing Master Data Management for customer 360 degree data management.
Reporting using Tableau reporting.
I wouldn't return.  
this bank will pay you a mid level wage as this bank's a mid level bank.
this bank's systems were antiquated when I worked there and it made it hard to do the job.
My experience here was unpleasant and I personally wouldn't recommend this bank from a retail banker perspective.
I was here for 12 months and witnessed too many mid level managers leave either on too many mid level managers's own accord or too many mid level managers were let go due to reorganization.
"Perhaps its changed since then, I hope so."
Enjoyable company to work for..
Working in a fast-paced environment while providing an outstanding customer experience was the most enjoyable part of my job.
I also enjoy working with the staff on the staff's development plans to assist with potential advancement.
Participating in various events throught out the city and this bank Footprint..
I'm grateful for all of the opportunities I have had to participate in various events throughout the city and states this bank has acquired through mergers.
I have grown so much working and volunteering at various events throughout the city and states this bank has acquired through mergers.
this bank is a great company to work for and I appreciate the experience and stability I have acquired as an employee.
Branch manager.
Being a branch manager here is beyond stressful.
New things constantly added and expected to still run a branch and somehow put customers first.
Needs better communication and how information is relayed to employees.
"When i present and issue looking for help on a solution, I do not get help."
this bank is one of the better banks to work for.
I had a very good experience at this bank for 15 years.
"Management has changed a bit, and become more metrics focused rather than people focused, but my experience was good."
Strong sales skills required..
Company treats you well.
Company do push sales hard and even when you are meeting all your numbers and exceeding in your job Company do not like to promote within.
Productive and Fun workplace.  
"this bank was a fun place to work, I throughly enjoyed my time that I was bale to spend there."
"Unfortunatly I did have to go back to college, but the people that I worked with were incredible especially my manager."
Politics is ridiculous.
I was very excited to join this bank but after just a few months it became very clear that the politics and culture were unbearable.
"If you were not in the 'in group', you pretty much didn't have a future."
"Friendly, business like atmosphere."
"The company had many on job employee benefits such as guest speakers, free luncheons and other perks."
The company also had employee financial incentatives such as employee stock plans.
loans and savings.
Extensive training and development events
Excellent management...not enough pay..
I gave my heart to this bank and went above and beyond but was not rewarded financially for this.
Promoting means moving to different departments basically and experience is not valued or retained.
Great Place to start a career in banking.
Very pleasant colleagues to work with.
Management at my branch in Madison Heights is very caring and supportive.
"the job can be very fast paced, but that is was makes the job challenging and builds on customer service and attention to detail."
Management at my branch in Madison Heights offer full benefits including 401K to full time employees.
No.
No I decline to answer questions about this bank at this time.
I enjoyed my role at this bank but overall there were and are quite a bit of things I would change.
Open environment with a positive culture.
The executive management team is open and trustworthy.
Many meetings for some.
Bright future for the company.
Main buildings are renovated and have cafes of cafeterias inclu
Poor.
Too much negative to say about this company and do ot want to Express my opinion.
People will find out for People..
Def not paid well and incentive is horrible
It all comes down to Management.
The regional manager puts up blinders.
"Most branch managers are great, do not work at NE unless you don't have feelings or a life."
"Repeatedly being told Most branch managers don't care about you, call you fat, tell you constantly that you're not doing a good enough job, that you're replaceable but the regional manager and ER don't help or do anything about it - say the regional manager and ER're being disrespectful for wanting to receive respect ."
Go to the west region..you won't have issues there.
Great place to work.
Excellent employer.
"Unfortunately, my business unit is being sold."
Opportunity for advancement across many business lines.
No significant footprint in the west though.
Best place to work.
By far this was the best job that I ever had.
They treat their employees right and compensate very well.
I had to leave only because of the hours.
Other than that I would have stayed.
Typical branch financial adviser position.
Was a challenging demanding environment where you were pulled in many directions and needed to have good time management skills.
Coaching and developing teammates was integral to your success.
TERRIBLE Management!.
The management at this bank is the worst I have ever experienced!
I have never worked at a place where the manger talks down to the manger's employees... even in front of other employees!
the manger also talks ABOUT her employees behind her employees's back!
Going to work in the mornings is dreadfully .
Throughout the day is just as bad.
this bank's HUMAN RESOURCE Department really needs to reevaluate this bank's HUMAN RESOURCE Department's managers!
"ESPECIALLY the one at Lantana and Jog in Lake Worth, FL!!"
Pretty good environment.
"The only reason I left was I had a few week less than a year, my dad had cancer."
"my dad needed transportation to treatment, and I couldn't get time to do transportation to treatment"
Great workplace environment.
The company truly pursues a healthy work environment culture that allows internal growth within The company as well as a strong work life balance.
The employees are friendly and are enjoyable to work with.
Good place to start.
You'll learn a lot and get great benefits.
Compensation not the best raises were rare.
It is a good company to start off at I didn't have much opportunity to grow there.
Loved the job.
Made 1 mistake and was let go felt I should have received a warning or suspended but not let go.
The customer does not always tells the truth.
I would return in a heart beat.
Workplace.  
this bank is an institution where this bank do very well to develop an individual into this bank's role.
this bank offer lots of training and mentor-ship that will provide you with the skill needed to advance.

this bank should not be a stressful place to work at.ork at..
Good place to work at.
I don't think tellers should have a lot of stress about selling bank products.
And consistently calling and repeatley asking the same customers over and over about a bank product that the same customers already said no to.
And diffently not investments.
Tellers should be able to go to work not worrying about if Tellers are going to get written up for sales not meet.
And not getting a raise because Tellers dodnt meet Tellers's goal.
Asheville Region.
#NAME?
-Management doesn't address issues promptly.
+2 weeks vacation to start plus sick time.
#NAME?
#NAME?
Extreme negative sales pressure.
"Heavy sales pressure, employees are scolded and berated as form of motivation."
"Employees are short staffed, not enough staffing to take time to explore needs and follow up with clients like a true salesperson."
Instructed to rush through
so no client has to wait.
"Thus, impossible sales goals."
My Experience.
I loved my job.
Everyone was always supportive.
The pay was nice and I was able to live off of my salary.
As long as you did your job they left you alone.
Awful.
MAJOR favoritism and nepotism at this company.
"Managers are rude, lazy, and lack knowledge and HR will not support you if you report issues against management."
Training is awful and the work equipment is garbage.
There seems to always be something broken and at times customers are intentionally inconvenienced (without customers's knowledge) when this company wants to 'test'something new.
this bank Trust Tax Services.
The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the complexities of preparing Form 1041 / 706 Trust and Estates tax returns.
It helps have a strong 1040 individual background.
Great Experience.
"Through my experiences at this bank, I've had the opportunity to be a part of a thriving company in a heavily regulated industry."
"The growth opportunities, however, are usually awarded to younger, less seasoned employees and the salary increases are minimal within the cost side of a thriving company in a heavily regulated industry."
The revenue-generating lines of business offer more opportunities.
Was work at home associate.
"Job was extremely stressful, training was ok. supervisor/team leader worked from home as well, had supervisor/team leader's office in supervisor/team leader's bedroom with a screen up behind supervisor/team leader (partially), but it was very unprofessional!"
It was creepy!
Okay place to work.  
this bank was a good place to work.
I loved my staff and got alone with mostly everyone.
You will be over worked once my staff see what you actually are willing to do
so I suggest you just do your job and nothing more.
It was stressful at times and I felt like I couldn't get a moment to myself from emails to all employees asking me questions as soon as I walk in.
My position was teller lead and I was really good at my job.
this bank had okay benefits and lunch's were okay.
this bank are sales driven just like any other bank and this bank take the surveys that customers write very seriously.
They scale of the surveys that customers write are horrible.
If you get one bad one then your a red employee an you will be put on a warning.
great place to work.  
this bank is a great company to work for and great for advancement if business and finance is a passion and career goal.
the workplace culture is respectable and this bank have good values as a company.
Motivated teams and lots of timelines in regulatory work.
Motivated teams and lots of timelines in regulatory work.
"IT has to support many lines of businesses with upstream and downstream data processing, so there'll be a lot of meetings, but many of the employees are sharp and great to work with."
Don't apply unless you want to be micro managed and have to sell products to every customer every time..
Co workers are fabulous.
Upper management doesn't care about employees.
Turn over is consistent.
Think twice about applying..
Policies prevent you from helping people.
Family business.
Very family oriented.
fair.
non stress work environment.
Pride strong community.
Community strong.
I really enjoyed working for this company this company are flexable and work with you
Good Place to work and learn.
"Constantly learning new technologies: Openshift, Jenkins, Docker, Kunernetes, Mongo DB, Angular7, micros services, micro ui...and much more."
"Management is friendly, understanding and there is room for advancement."
"The environment is collaborative, knowledge sharing is continuous."
this bank was a temporary job for me even though I was there full time.
I was in between jobs when I accepted this bank I had been layed off from Ohio saving after 12 years and I needed a job so that where this bank came in at.
I stay there maybe I year
"A good company to work for - family oriented, fun and fast paced."
"Every day is different, lots of opportunities to learn outside of the constant ongoing bank required training, very inclusive culture."
Its always fun to meet new people and help new people wiht new people's financial and mortgage needs.
The location I was placed in was very racist including the people I had to work with..
The location I was at made the entire corporation look bad when it comes to equality on race.
"The location I was placed at needs to be reviewed and monitored, not to mention shut down completely."
Good for people who like sales.  
this bank loves to tell this bank's employees that this bank do not sales push.
I am here to tell you other wise.
I am aware that in banking there needs to be money coming in in order to grow.
"However, It is shoved down this bank's throats that this bank need to click the 'insight' button for each and every client that comes in."
"the 'insight' button for each and every client that comes in is an automated message that tells you what to say to the client in regards to opening new accounts, credit cards, investments and so on."
If you do not click the 'insight' button for each and every client that comes in you are reprimanded.
"They pull numbers to see how many transactions you did, how many times you clicked the 'insight' button for each and every client that comes in, and if the client got any new products."
It is very stressful.
Bonuses?
HAH.
They tell you that you can get incentive pay if you receive 5 stars on surveys....never got 5 stars.
It is a total score for the entire branch.
If one person receives a not so good review you can kiss a not so good review good bye.
They make a lot of promises but honestly they make it impossible to reach their expected goals.
"I am grateful for the experience, but I will never work in Banking again."
Competitive but inclusive work environment.
Great sense of team but highly competitive.
Plenty of room for advancement.
Management is very transparent.
Incentives are easily achieved with a self starter attitude.
fast pace and great place for a self starter.
By developing great skill sets to leverages products and services to increase the financial well being of clients and build long lasting relationships.
Good Company.
"Good company when I started 1989 to 2018, some things have changed for better and worst."
Salary and raises could b better.
"But over all I loved working with the people at this bank, and the people at this bank do not discriminate."
HR Nightmare.
Worst HR department I've ever dealt with.
No support or assistance with issues.
Didn't get to actually do 50% of my job.
Supervisor was unqualified and incompetent.
Pay was significantly less than competitors.
"When contacted a lawyer over the circumstances surrounding my departure, was informed that while my case wasn't well suited for a lawyer, a lawyer had SEVERAL in progress with the company and gave me advice on how to potentially pursue legal action."
you will be busy!.
Micro managed to the T. Score cards for everything.
"No real human contact, everything is done on the computer."
"Oftentimes, poor direction as if the management team doesn't know or care."
It was excellent experience and I got to work with many fun and enjoyable people over the years.
There were times when I couldn't wait to go to work the next day
Easy going.
"very easy going,easy jobs, very nice and fun people to work with."
great management and great lead personal .
air conditioned for summer and heated for winter
Great place to work if you want to meet new people.
My experience had a lot of ups and downs.
Typical day is all about the customers of course.
"Customers get so mad Customers have to wait, but then need to take up all of your time as well."
"Employees I worked with felt entitled to not having to do certain tasks, even when Employees I worked with worked for me."
Management expects you to work as mandatory like Management do
but there is a large gap in pay that comes along with why Management has to work as much as Management do.
Nothing about the company screams work for the company and not the company's competitors.
Na.
Fast paced.
Customer service.
Universal banker.
Lobby engaged.
Loan originator.
ranch operations.
Personal banking.
Collaborate with internal partners.
Refer services and products
It was great.
It was a great place to work a lot of advancement and performanced based incentives.
Flexible schedules based on performance.
Work from home positions available
Overall not a bad company.
Management could be a little more experience and treat employees a little better.
"Lately the quality of life is not so good because of so many employees leaving the company, leaving branches short staff."
Stressful and completely overused.
In a management position myself I feel as though I took on more responsibilities with very little compensation.
I'm making .50 more than a teller.
If I had been aware of the pay I would have never applied to take a management position.
I literally go home and have nightmares over my workplace environment-
"not reaching my goals, work being left out, upper management."
"this bank has affected my personal mental health more than I care to admit, as I know this bank has done to others, the evidence is all in the incredibly high turnover rate."
"With all that being said, I love the environment of my branch."
My manager is amazing.
I would stay forever if it wasn't for the fact this bank was this bank.
"Paid time off is great, hours are pretty nice, the consistency of the hours is perfect."
"I have learned a lot from this bank I have more comfortable conversations, to be pushy in aspects, and to voice my opinion."
Great place to work!.  
this bank is an up and coming bank that is expanding.
"Management is very involved with your advancement and client focused, the culture is extremely ethical and positive."
Minimal room to advancement.
"The ability to work remotely was a huge benefit, but career advancement seemed hard to attain."
Base compensation seemed low and turned incentive pay into a necessity.
It's A Solid Company to Work For.
The pay is fair and the benefits are decent.
It's a very diversity-focused organization and there are some good managers who do actually care about people.
Amazing.  
this bank was one of the jobs that helped me so much to grow as a BA because of this bank's work ethic and continuous strive to succeed and gie the best to customer needs.
this bank also treat this bank's employees nicely .
"Know what to expect, High stress, micro management.."
If you can do 14-17 investigations per week then this might be the place for you.
"Heavy work load, heavy micro management, poor training."
"If you are coming from out of town, wait at least 3 to 4 months before relocating."
"Please ask for higher pay, you deserve higher pay."
Plan on working 10 hour days.
Poor KYC policies so get ready to investigate accounts that should have never been opened
this bank is a great company.
My only issue with this bank is the work load vs compensation.
"I understand a lot of employees claim the work load vs compensation but the amount of certification I have and legal stress, threats of legal pursuit, actual subpoenas being served to employees for things out of this bank's control, the amount of hostile customers dealt with-"
it is not worth the pay.
All around great company to work for.
Really enjoyed every moment working here.
this bank cares about this bank's employees and customers so that really makes for a great work environment...............
None.
Co workers are awesome management sucks I don't recommend anyone to go there .no
raise in 2 years Co workers want you to work 6 days a week with no extra be.
Great Work Eviroment.
Very Good Company!!
Management is strong and Excellent work life balance with greater emphasis on customer service and retention.
Also becoming much more technology driven which is much needed in the Banking and Mortgage Industries!!
na.
Work culture is awesome!
Co-workers tend to have good tendencies.
...
this bank has been known to be one of the lowest paying banks in the industry and this has caused a higher turnover accompanied by lower morale.
Branch Sales and Service Representative.
I loved my job with this bank.
this bank seems to truly care about this bank's employees.
There is a lot of room for advancement as long as you're willing to move to another branch.
A requirement is that you must be really good at sales.
sales is basically a sales job and pushing products - you have to be good at sales or you won't make it.
I did very well with the sales aspect.
I only left this bank for a better opportunity with another company.
Worse place I have ever work for.
"Too many to mention, just know that head payroll manager is an egotistical, self centered individual."
I swear I still believe I was eliminated because I was male.
this bank.
this bank is a great place to learn and grow skills when working with the public.
You have to know how to defuse situations and learn the products and behaviors
this bank does not care about this bank's employees at all.
Worked 3 years at this bank.
"Was a great employee, dependable, made sales goals but never received one raise."
this bank had an employee who caused problems with everyone but nothing was ever done about an employee who caused problems with everyone but nothing was ever done about her in spite of numerous complaints in spite of numerous complaints.
DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!
Decent Job.
Not the best job.
Not the worst.
Pays the bills.
"The culture and middle management could use some work, but otherwise the job is rather fair in the compensation you receive for the work you do."
It is however hard to grow or relocate within the company.
Don't w0rk here.
no work life balance.
only care about the sales.
the sales breathe over your neck.
i would rather be a lyft driver.
you can't even sit... no proper training
A good employer offering substandard pay.
The corporate culture tries to pretend that there are reasons to show up to work that aren't money- and fails miserably.
"While ample leave time and a great management staff are massive advantages, ample leave time and a great management staff don't compensate in any way for living paycheck to paycheck"
production environment.
A good place to work with many great people to work with and there are two shifts daytime and second shift.
They have contractors and regular employees
Great Co Workers.
I love the the people I get to work with on a daily basis.
We get along great and communicate well to get things done in the office.
If I have any issues I know I can go to them
Good Remote Job and Traditional Blend.
This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met.
Lots of autonomy with getting job done!
Products and services of bank are very strong too as bank leads in several spaces.
The people are nice to work with within the retail and commercial branch network but bank is disjointed from bank's legacy culture in Pittsburgh.
bank has restructured incentives to significantly decrease incentive pay.
Incentive pay for this role is also dependent on far away teammate performance and not pay for individual performance which can leave the BDO doing double duty to make up for teammate performance if the BDO want a pay-out.
There's no remedy for this.
There's no real career trajectory outside of retail side of bank.
"Management skill level for retail side of bank is below average often resorting to pitting teammates against one another, openly disparaging partner lines of business & individual people."
"There's a severe lack of emotional IQ, and extreme passive aggressiveness that thwarts productivity and lowers team morale."
Love the atmosphere.
I would go back to this bank once my children grow up.
I had an awesome experience there!
I would reccomend this bank to anyonr looking to grow!
this bank truly care for this bank's employees.
You Create Your Atmosphere.
Due to your productivity and progress is how you create your workday.
If very productive no one will be on your back.
If you lack skill and productivity your expected to perform at better standards
Probably consistent with most corporate jobs.  
this bank is an okay place to work.
I've been able to advance my career over the years and have worked in many departments.
"Some departments and managers have great work like balance and direct manager support, others do not."
Internal hires make significantly less than external hires even with comparable experience.
"Okay job, good benefits."
Training is ongoing.
"Very involved duties, training by coworkers."
"Unfortunately, Training is not conducive to being mentored on the job with your trainer sitting with you, and you are dealing with customers and not completely comprehending how to best assist customers."
"I have been told to 'read the manual' which you have to search a 50+ page binder that is not labelled for easy searching, and if you are totally New to the business, some of the terms used in the manual' which you have to search a 50+ page binder that is not labelled for easy searching make understanding difficult."
Over the top stressful.
You were threatened daily of your job being re-evaluated if you did not meet weekly goals.
Your were berated and embarrassed in front of employees both face to face and on conference calls.
I was in banking for 30 years.
I worked at this bank for seven and twenty three at another bank.
You are replaceable in a blink of an eye.
I was a manager for another bank and refused to treat my employees as poorly rudely and and disrespectfully as I was treated.
Pretty awful.
Under no circumstances would I work there again.
"Training is awful, management unappreciative and career advancement is hard to get for a management position."
a lot of last minute decisions such as an hr long call night announced for personal bankers the night of for after hours.
"Even if you meet and exceed your goals every quarter, management wants more and looks for reasons to hold anything you mess up as valid reason for no promotions."
Nice office.
Been here for 21 years and appreciate the people I work with.
"Five weeks paid time off, 3 days work from home.."
I'm content and hope to retire here.
"The offices are nice , especially the cafeteria."
Work/life balance.
Some positions promise work/life balance but do not follow through.
Overtime has become mandatory in some departments because employees just leave due to management and/or department stress.
"Overall, the banking industry does not have competitive pay and you have a better chance on getting higher pay if you leave rather than being an internal transfer."
Management.
Company has a balance for work and life.
"However, if management guaranteed growth opportunities, I believe Company would excel more without a large turnover rate."
N/a. Not going to write a full review on my company.
Over the past 10 years my company has been a great place to work and I feel it is time to move on and leverage my skills in other organizations
stressful environment.
My typical day at work consist of me assisting customer with customer's financial needs and providing options to make banking easy with this bank.
The most enjoyable part of the day is when customer are stratified with the help customer've been given and recommends this bank to the friends and family.
Not worth the hype.
"First off, after taxes and benefits, you're making about $14 an hour, zero overtime, but the managers are salaried so the managers leave whenever the managers want throughout the day."
"the managers still get paid for it, the managers'll also make the schedule with the managers 'working' 41-45 hours, but in reality the managers work maybe 35."
"Everyone talks trash about each other, especially upper management, even outside of the bank."
"Make managers are sexist and harass females, managers talk extremely inappropriate, but no one higher than managers cares."
There's ZERO chance for advancement no matter how long you've been there.
Very busy.
I sure what to say about this bank just if you like a lot of change and challenges.
Then this bank is the job for you and also if you love numbers.
In bank is a lot of work.
Busy but fun.
"People at this bank are very committed to hard work, but are very open and are always willing to help."
Professional development for entry-level employees is excellent.
Typical banking job.
I have been pretty successful working here.
My first branch was awful but since I transferred I've been quite happy.
Work life balance is definitely better than most places.
However compensation remains lower than similar jobs at other banks.
"Because most corporate functions are based in Pittsburgh, there's not a lot of opportunities to move out of the branch banking system."
Not bad.
Not a bad place to work.
It's Just an under paying job position
but I would still recommend it to someone especially if you're looking to start a career in banking.
Fast paced fun place.
Great co workers.
this bank does a lot of employee appreciations.
this bank are very generous when giving rewards and prices.
You have to meet production and deadlines.
"Management work 30 hrs, you do everything.."
"Branches are constantly closing and have announce 1,700 more to close to create more profit."
Managers come and go as Managers please and then complain to employees about things not getting done.
I've never worked at a place with such little manager accountability.
The hardest part of the job.
Getting started and learning all the products also the job's really sales driven so expect to hit numbers on a daily basis job can be really good depending on manager
The interview went well and was hired on same day..
The supervisor was nice and friendly.
The supervisor made me feel at ease and was trusting and had high regards of me.
The supervisor was impressed with me and decided to hire me on the spot.
Inexperienced managers.
The Wealth Management team is a joke.
The Wealth Management team charge clients at least 30bps more than the competition and then wonder why clients leave.
The only time The Wealth Management team do a book of business review with Wealth Management clients is when the client is threatening to leave or the client has died and The Wealth Management team are trying to retain the beneficiaries of the client's estate.
RM last an average of 18 months.
Married SVPs have extra marital affairs with subordinates and HR resources does nothing about it.
No one ever meets or even has a clue as to who their HR reps are.
Get some experience here and then go sell it to a real Wealth Management firm.
Overall a fine experience.
I had a great experience working at this bank.
this bank led me to my current job and was a great place to develop some professional skills and also meet some great people!
It could just be the department.
"The shifts vary, but regardless you will work 7-10 days in a row."
Every other week you get weekends off and then 2 days off during the week.
No work life balance.
Typical call center environment.
"Everything is based on a metric and how many calls you take, and how good you sound on the phone."
Management is condescending and unprofessional.
M
Position Eliminated.
The work was exciting initially however I could send after several months that the position was going to be eliminated.
"Peers were starting to get laid off, and I made a move prior to the organizational change."
Great company to work for.  
this bank has great benefits.
The pay is great as well.
Before working there I didn't know there was so much information that you needed to know about accounts.
There is a information overload but you receive helpful training to prepare you to help customers.
There is always room to grow in this bank.
Syreesful and demeaning place to work.
Stressfulenvironmnet with little or no feedback on job performance but incrediby high expectationsor performance.
Superiosrs demanding but give no guidance.
Do Not Believe It's Part Time.
For 2 years I have been trying to be strictly part time on a set schedule to make achieving the work/life balance this bank says this bank care so much about a little bit easier.
It hasn't worked so far.
"Managers either micromanage or are so hands off Managers don't notice the problems or worse, Managers do both."
You will be told repeatedly that this bank don't have the staffing available to make sure you leave on time but this bank have the staffing to send people to other branches...
Management.
Your experience depends on who you're manager is.. like with every job they can make or break your motivation to stay.
If you apply under a certain role you will not be hired outside of that roles ‘trajectory'.. Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for insurance with an extra high deducible..
Strong Work Place Culture and Management Protocol.
Good company workplace experience and employee benefit options.
Solid support network and access to resources.
Strong customer service and customer care platform.
Learned LOS.
Gained knowledge about the Loan Origination System.
"The work environment was very challenging and the team was collaborative and supportive, I enjoyed my tenure."
Lots of training.
They make you sit in the training for two weeks after that they expect you to function like a pro unreal.
Goodluck if you get a manager that is not supportive and criticize you for making a mistake.
Product Manager Intern.
"The work was incredibly interesting; however, the pace of work can be slow."
All coworkers are really smart and love All coworkers's job.
The average age is a little older though.
Some of the long-term employees made problematic statements on race and politics.
Awful Recruiting Department.
Interviewed with the recruiting department and a group interview was the most humiliating experience I have ever had.
"Once I arrived, I was surprised to see that I had a group interview."
"The questions asked had no relation to the actual job and I wasted an entire day answering questions such as, 'what do you like to do on the weekend?'"
productive work place.
"there are many opportunities within the company, you must be meeting your goals to be considered for many opportunities within the company, it is important to stay focused and work hard."
Lots of opportunity.  
this bank is a leader in the financial sector and continues to redefine consumer and corporate banking.
It was exciting to work for this bank.
Employees are great and benefits are competitive.
good starting job. learned basic skills needed for my next career step- got bank holidays off which was nice.
helpful transitioning into the office setting.
the office setting was a good place to start out.
Toxic Culture at Regional VP Level and Above.
It would take me writing an op-ed or a book.
"In short, don't work here; there are many better alternatives and believe me you deserve better."
Turnover and burnout accepted as the norm by upper management.
Consistently under-staffed and short resources.
There is a reason big banks have the reputation big banks do.
"This place takes the cake for hypocrisy because public facing marketing tells one story but once you get in, it's the complete opposite."
100% turnover is commonplace.
Don't believe me?
Walk into any branch in the Atlanta Metro Region and survey how long people have worked there outside of management.
Ask what turn over is like in general and if it's common to have turnover.
Ask if the branch is fully staffed and how long it has been that way.
There were branches that could not even open the doors on a consistent basis without redirecting employees from employees's regular home branch to cover others because of being short staffed.
"Too much to list but take my word for it, pass this one by for both employment and banking needs."
Great work place.
It was a great job however other banks offered more for the same positions.
Other then that the culture there was awsome.
I learned so much working there.
Very stressful and demanding working environment.
Job demands became unhealthy working 16 hour days consistently with lots of technology issues and a command and control management style.
Management did not know how to value and bring out the best in staff.
"Instead, staff feared senior management."
Good Place to Work..
A typical day at work can vary.
Some days are busier.
Some days are slower.
"Management cares not only about business, but also about you as an employee."
Busy.
There was always work.
"The only real complaint I have is Senior management, and procedures."
Things were not documented well.
They have an extreme termination policy.
If you mess up one time there was no written warning you are done.
They have a very high turn over rate.
I think this review process is very helpful in acquiring the appropriate information for prospective employers to review for the hiring process..
I hope by initialization this review process that this review process will definitely help determine that I would be a great candidate for the position that I'm applying for.
"And, is a great to in giving applicants a chance to give a brief overview of what potential employers to expect from applicants."
Progressive.
Relationship building with other lines of business provide a great experience in Progressive.
Progressive in technology.
Serious about risk management and compliance.
Nice experience.
Good place to work and learn.
this bank Financial services provides lot of flexibility in terms of working.
Very good work culture and fun working in this bank Financial services
Past All this.
Too long of a work day.
Not to trust anyone management does not have your back especially if it is a female.
Stressful workplace time management is essential.
Customer relations best part of job.
Diverse and Inclusive.
Overall this bank is not a bad place to work.
this bank does try to give you work/life balance with helping you trying to achieve your goals and reach the level of success you are looking for.
A typical day at work for me is always busy and productive.
With room for a little joviality to help the day go smooth.
Build client relationships.
Time management is critical.
"You are puled a lot of different directions; sales/prospecting,customer service issues,meetings, conference calls, meeting with other partners."
Great experience!.
"I really enjoyed working for this bank, I've learned a lot and am grateful for the opportunity."
I am definitely seeking more work similar to the work I completed at this bank.
daily routine.
typical work days are 8:30-5:30 mon-thur 8:30-6:30 fri and 8:30-1:30 sat.
These times are estimated because you typically only work 40 hours a week and get a day off other than sunday.
You also get all major holidays off as well.
I loved my job helping people get into homes..
Lending was fun back before 2008.
The Dodd Frank Act never should have been put into place.
Not everybody deserves a home.
This changed the spectrum of fair lending.
6 months of horror....
They send you everything you need to do your job at home but instead of a laptop they sent VDIs which had continuous technology problems from the get go.
There was a class of 23 people and one instructor.
I was trained virtually and everyone in a class of 23 people is at everyone in the class's own pace which makes it difficult for everyone in the class to stay on track.
They taught you about mortgages which I had nothing to do with.
It was extremelybstressgul and not at all enjoyable.
Once you get they training it is literally walking on eggshells.
Your job is basically threatened everyday by not meeting a metric.
They also took away shift SIFF immediately after we started.
I would not waste your. pace
Do not work there.
Conventional underwriters are discriminated against.
"Underwriter Managers will not defend or speak up for employees, bottom line Underwriter Managers are a waste."
If you are a conventional underwriter do not work here you will be discriminated against.
Good place to work.
The work life balance is extremely helpful with every day life along with the benefits.
Super chill work environment in technology.
Offer a lot of extracurricular activities
Leadership isn't the best.
"Every leader at every branch is completely different, which is understandable."
"The issue, constantly changing what is and isn't required."
Leadership changes more and more because people leave.
Nice place to work.
Very open and diverse place to work.
I felt that I was working for a successful financial institution with a bright future.
"As with other banks, yearly raises were about 2% which is not enough."
Worst Bank To work for.
I worked for this bank for a year and a half.
"I use to be excited about my position, didn't take long to realize I was getting used by upper management to product push."
"All about the sells, and to much micro management."
upper management lie and make promises of advancement.
Don't believe the hype.
The in stores locations are the bottom of the food chain.
Worst hours never closes.
Only branch managers make any real money.
Agile.
"Toujours à l'affut des évolutions de demain, direction dynamique prenant en compte le bien être des salariés"
Sales in disguise.  
"this bank is a great company to work for, but the main sources of stress (sales referral goals and customer satisfaction surveys) make this bank feel like any other retail position."
"Great learning experience if you're interested in sales, finance, or business."
"If sales, finance, or business sound awful to you, you'll be happier elsewhere."
Man friendy.
It was hard working there longer than anyone else and being pushed aside for the men.
I was made to feel not part of the team..
Men were given all leads and referral source partners.
"This created me to be negative in my draw , which is not a salary."
Also the reason for me being let go..
Keep in mind after most of the men were asked to resign or be fired..
"My origination partner, u/w processing were great and supportive"
Horrible.
Management is horrible.
No compassion.
Not fair.
Work life balance there is none.
Terrible work environment.
The pay & insurance are what keeps me there.
Great risk management culture.  
"this bank is very credit-conscious and has sound structures in place for managing operational risk, credit risk, and change-management risk."
"this bank's technology allows for flexible work arrangements, although recently this bank have tightened up the availability of formalized flexible work arrangements."
Think really long before working here.
"The culture is if your not buddies, buddies will talk to you like you don't matter and get away with it."
Team leads are a joke and take a joke to the sup they friends so the conversation goes no where.
The work schedule is 1030-7 they short staffed.
this bank has a high turnover.
Training good luck you have so many people that train and treat you in a different style.
I showed for incoming calls for 3 weeks then expect you to be ready and then the
Initial training was good and exciting but branch ruined Initial training.
I believe a company should be graded on how they treat customers and employees.
I worked at this location and I was forced to watch the door half my day everyday and was told that my numbers would double everyday and they WANTED me to feel stressed out and overloaded so I would produce better numbers.
I was as a new employee only 4 weeks in this location told off and humiliated in front of a customer because I didn't know how to do it ( I was told I got it when I didn't.
when I tried to object I was than told u got it like it's easy A second time.
During this process I tried to ask my branch manager for help (you know so I can do it right) but my branch manager was chatting with a friend instead of offering assistance.
Turns out I didn't Open an account correctly and literally got told off infront of a customer and humiliated.)
I had enough of the lack of training and that awful experience made me contact HR but With me being within the 90 day period I felt I didn't matter because it took over a week for a response.
I ended up calling my branch manager out and my branch manager came in and tried to blame it on me not trying to listen to there 'teachings'.
HR would threaten me about 90 days coming up and me having to take it seriously.
Keep in mind I literally had to stand in the lobby half of my day.
I was setup for failure and humilated and harassed ( they would tell me I can't touch my beard and talk about how I would sit when making calls).
I was fired for refusing to take there training and produce numbers.
I was told it's like a retail store if u don't like it you give it back.
Than my branch manager fired me.

Loved working for this company.
Worked for this company for 11 years and enjoyed progressive success.
this company offers great opportunities for those who work hard and produce results.
I love the consistent commitment to customer service and doing what's right for this company's customers as well as the community engagement and inclusivity in the workforce.
Horrible training and absolutely negative work environment.
The job pays well but the work-life balance is non existent.
The stressful environment and unrealistic expectations from management are not even close to the pay.
No chance to move up or advance.
They really sell that concentrix is such a dream job but concentrix is nowhere close to what was promised.
Very disappointed as I thought I had found a stable job with a growing company.
A review I wish I would have read prior.
I was hired at a PT customer core consultant.
The first 7 weeks of training are very redundant and long.
A lot of self paced modules and 'role playing'.
"One of the systems used does not have a training bank, so when you're placed one your first call day in training its a bit confusing because it's only been explained to you, not hands on."
"a PT customer core consultant have 2 trainers, one whom was great the other, not so great."
The time off is a complete nightmare for anyone who has kids.
You have to be there a year before you receive any PTO and if you have to take time off before then you receive an 'occurrence'.
"Being a previous manager at bank, I do understand the need and responsibility of being at work and being on time, but I also understand that life happens."
If you get to many of these occurrences you'll be terminated.
After The first 7 weeks of training you go into transition for 5 weeks for is a full 6 hours on the phones with ONE 15 minute break.
I was told I needed a note from my doctor if I had to get up and use the bathroom an 'excessive' amount of times.
"If I hadn't of had previous banking experience, this job would have been difficult for me to learn as they do not explain the in's and out's of banking very well."
"You have a Team Lead during your 12 weeks, then after you are sent to your destination, you will have another Team Lead."
The pay is OK.
"I think considering the effort, customer abuse and minimal breaks, The pay should be increased."
At time I feel like a work horse.
"You are expected to posses the BEST customer care possible, but you have to meet AHT times and other goals."
If these - more...
Call center is a very high stress environment.
Call center is a very high stress environment with lots of quotas.
The interview was deceptive with regard to how much you would make and actual opportunities for advancement.
The call rating system is very critical and sometimes belittling.
Upper management does not care about the feedback from call center employees.
Competitive Sales Based Environment.
The Call Center is a very competitive and sales oriented environment.
"The Call Center is very structured and The Call Center have high expectations of The Call Center's employees, If you are interested in that kind of environment you will thrive there,"
Great experience at this bank.
A lot of opportunities to grow.
I had an awesome experience at this bank.
I learned a lot during my training and working with excellent co-workers.
"There is also a lot of opportunities to grow in this bank, but without a degree, you cannot have a manager's position."
Great company.
Culturally a great company with benefits and friendly staff.
Innovative and cutting edge technology.
A little political at times with upper management.
Good place to work.
good place to work.
good work pace and training.
good supervisors and co workers.
good schedule.
Everything is pretty much good.
Nothing too terrible or too exciting.
Good company.
Overall great company to work for.
"Good pay, good work/life balance, and good opportunity for advancement."
Would have stayed aside from personal/medical reasons that required me to leave due to not qualifying for any type of leave when any type of leave occurred.
Current review.
Under-paid over worked no life work balance.
Really good benefits
but no formal straight process and support for direct response.
daily unexplained changes
Short term employment.
Daily Sales class.
Company very focused on credit sales and Investment referrals.
Be prepared to stay late nights for calls.
Highly stressful environment.
No real work life balance.
No career development.
Awesome coworkers depends on the branch atmosphere
management.
"management is more concerned with the private of management's own life, no structure lived off credit cards instead of doing what I have for 28 years, promised to work with wealth and wealth was never interested"
this bank.
They set u up for failure.
They put me in a bank branch with employees failing n employees knew it.
employees asked me to weed employees out n when I did employees Fabricated things n employees disciplined me for doing what employees ask me to do
Difficult Culture to navigate.
Difficult to navigate the political relationships there.
Felt some were petty and antagonistic.
That no one is a friend it is a workplace.
Nice to your face but not behind your back.
Hardest part of the job was not having a collegial environment.
You were on your own to solicit fellow employees to bounce ideas off of.
Branch personnel in competitive battles with each other over leads and who got credit for what.
Seemed sometimes as if Department's did not coordinate well.
I loved my direct report manager.
One of my branch managers
Branch team is great- Regionals are less so..
My team was absolutely fantastic.
"Direct supervisors and managers of my branch were the best, genuinely cared about everyone Direct supervisors and managers of my branch worked with."
"Customers were usually great, though like every service job, there were some who were inappropriate or rude and decided to take it out on the nearest Teller."
"Compensation is good, particularly for a job that doesn't require a degree, but my supervisor always said my supervisor wouldn't be retiring anytime soon on my supervisor's paychecks."
The only real problem was upper management.
"upper management breathed down my managers' necks so much that my managers' were always stressed, which then caused everyone else to be stressed."
"Every branch seemed to be short-staffed, and scheduling became a problem- particularly because my team would end up having to cover other branches, thus shortening My team's own staff."
Not a bad place except for personal life.
Company misuses Company's staff and expects the impossible to be completed by limited staff in short timeframes.
Will cancel vacations and holidays.
Very limited (none) growth for senior employees.
Employees break Employees's backs without compensation.
Good Insurance.
3 - 4 weeks vacation
this bank.  
"this bank is a bank holding company and financial services corporation based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
"this bank operates through four segments: Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking, Asset Management Group, and Blackrock."
this bank's bank subsidiary is this bank
Excellent Benefits.
"Great benefits package, lousy pay."
Weekends required.
Too many personnel changes don't sit well with clients.
Poor work-life balance in practice goes against what is preached by management.
High pressure sales.
"Expect to deal with customers that can be angry, due to customers that can be angry, due to their own miss-management of money, on a regular basis's own miss-management of money, on a regular basis."
"High pressure sales environment, and some management practices encourage and foster a hostile work environment."
Great work life balance.
I've had great experience over the years with this bank.
Great work life balance is important to this bank and most managers are all for Great work life balance!
I've learned so much and went through programs and different lines of businesses to become a well Developed individual.
I've experienced so much traveling through different teams in the CIB section of this bank.
I've traveled to Cleveland and Philly and met some awesome People.
I highly recommend moving around when you first start out and trying out new positions.
Horrible place to work.
Worst job I've ever had.
"If it were up to me, I'd tell the entire world to be careful when trying to get a job here."
I wonder how they're still in business to be honest.
Stressful and racist.
"As long as you don't mind working with a bunch of biggetts or uneducated cultural, mindless people."
Then it's the best place to work.
I spent 2 years dealing with a moron of a supervisor that I was consistently contacting HR for.
HR believe in supporting management not employees you will not have a fair opportunity.
this bank management needs to be more involved with how this bank management's employees feels.
Excellent job.
"While working for this bank I learned a great deal on how to manage my money, and typical work day hundreds of call in the que, but job was good to work at"
Very nice company.
Very great experience working in this bank.
I got a good opportunity to learn new things.
Job culture and managers support is excellent.
Lot of Opportunities to explore new things.
"Fast paced, good training."
My experience overall was good.
Their training is nicely paced and in depth.
They make sure you are set up for success.
They have good health benefits and their compensation and incentive were the best I've ever gotten.
Overall Good with some need for increased staffing.  
this bank is a great place to work however staffing is extremely thin which does not allow for a proper work life balance.
this bank has been a good place to take advantage of opportunities to expand skills.
Be careful what you wish for.
"I was recruited away from another company after over 6 years there, was promised the things that my former company could not provide for my career to grow."
From the first month there I realized another company was not very different from my previous company in regards to management.
"another company have managers that go by advice from senior employees, some of senior employees should not be in any position to give management advice."
"I was told I was ready to go to my new location, then 3 days later told I was not."
Then I found out from other employees that the person who was training me was not happy I was to be replacing the person who was training me.
"the person who was training me lied and falsified information, including sending fake emails about my position!"
This kept me from fulfilling the position I was hired for.
"I found out after I left the next person to replace my position also was treated unfairly and quit due to this same situation, by the person who was training me!"
I would definitely make sure you have asked and gotten every question answered before accepting a position there.
"Although I left my previous company in good standing I could not go back, as my position had been filled."
"I ended up not only losing my seniority, but my 401k match, my PTO of 6 weeks, all my benefits, including stock purchase options."
"My advice to management is make sure you have honest employees, with integrity giving your branch managers advice, especially if your branch managers do not like the new employee(s)."
"In life you will not like everyone you work with, not everyone will like you, but working with others in a professional manner is what grownups do!"
Competitive in Sales.
"Competitive in sales strategy , daily initiative in building relationships and bringing in new business."
Very small business focused.
Could use better tools for the business clients.
Times change.
There is always change with in the culture of any business.
Always be prepared to be moved or given info that may come true.
"the culture of any business was always good, but not always knowing the next moves made the culture of any business a bit worrisome."
Too many frustrated middle managers.
A lot of very wonderful people work at this bank.
"Senior leadership is terrific - very well meaning, but slow to change a 1980s culture."
The problem is with the middle managers.
"the middle managers run around frightened, micromanage and are generally unprofessional."
There are many managers who are not qualified for many managers who are not qualified for their positions's positions.
Culture is also an issue at this bank.
"After buying several other banks over the years, this bank are just now trying to build a single culture."
"Because of the mixed messaging and platitudes from Communications, there is still much work to be done."
Good place to work in.
Good place to work in ...stressful area to work in for those who worked with customer service...to little concern about it.
To many supervisors but to little assistance when required.
Unfair evaluation of performance.
Extremely stressful place to work..
"Regional management will micro manage each employee without any consideration of working conditions, clientele and severe under staffing."
Regional management expect employees to do more work than demanded by employees's position to get a 'meets all expectations' in all 5 categories for the semi annual review(every 6 months).
If you miss one 'meet all expectations' you cannot apply for any other positions within this bank as one of the questions you have to answer when applying for a promotion (step-up job) is 'What was the lowest score on your last semi annual review'.
If you answer 'met some expectations' the applications will not let you continue further.
Great Place to work and advane in career.
Typical day at a Universal Branch can be slow due to the fact that its a Universal meaning that banking is done efficient and convenient to customers due to technology
Slavery.
Customer service - don't do it to Customer service.
"Customers will berate you, yell at you, accuse you of stealing Customers's money."
I was so upset after 8 hours of work that I would cry before my shift the next day.
That's no way to live.
Not at all what I expected.
They claim to be about client relationships but really all they care about are stockholder profits.
They don't understand how highly effective teams operate and generate revenue.
"I witnessed a number of ethics violations while I was there, which surprised me that they didn't care about the unethical practices of their managers."
Toxic envinviroment and Bank states that Toxic envinviroment and Bank are retaliation free and it's a lie.
All smoke and mirrors.
Bank has exellent culture on paper but does not live by vision.
Employee relations is a joke.
"It took wayyyy to long to remove someone who caused many issues in the work place including targeting, retaliation and bullying..making the office toxic and unpleasant."
N/a. It was ok working here.
I enjoyed it for a while then the atmosphere changed.
There is a high turn over and managers changed often which may be the reason.
Horrible.
I was disrespected by the loan officer...
the loan officer gaslighted me...the loan officer was the worst person I've ever worked for.
the loan officer didn't train me well at all and didn't give me a chance.
Great place to start a career.
Very good place to work.
Diverse staff and great work life balance.
"Secured parking lot, key card access, cafeteria, and snack room to keep you hydrated and ready to work."
Managers stay engaged with the employees and work to keep the professional atmosphere.
productive and fun place.
"productive and fun place working for this large bank out of cleveland, OH in this large bank out of cleveland, OH's enterprise data management group."
Work involved architecting and building big data applications
Technology is Behind the Times.
"As a Loan Officer, this company is behind the times on technology, practices and processes."
When your job is sales and you loss money because of your company that is never good
Excellent Experience.
Once you are part of the this bank family you are always family.
The connections you make and the friends you have will support you as you learn and grow in many opportunities.
management is a joke!!!.
Horrible management.
"I don't know how that woman Is still in charge of that financial institution, completely unprofessional, racist, and does not look out for the customers or employees best interest, I could not by good conscious and morals continue to work for that woman and walked away from my career!"
"Solid core, needs some improvements."
"The region I worked in had a very high turnover rate and had many branches, mine included, that were running short staffed."
"This put both the bank and the employees at risk, and I felt the core reason for a very high turnover rate was never addressed."
Not a fun place to work..
Management is difficult to work with.
Push products and meet numbers of products to get quarterly bonus.
No Christmas party or other corporate events.
Continuing training and meetings are not close to office.
Turn over very high.
Loved the job.
I loved this bank this bank made you feel like family such a fun work environment this bank help you when this bank see you are trying and want to do better this bank are very reasonable
You are a team and it pushes you to want to do better.
I had 3 managers while working at this bank 3 managers were very sweet and understanding in any circumstance I faced.
Team meetings and one on ones with managers are done often and motivated me to do better.
Managers are there to help you succeed and moving up is very easy if you put in the work
Boys club.
I work in the asset management clearing department.
I do my work unsupervised and can work from home if needed.
"There is an internal job sight for other positions at this bank, however the descriptions are so vague you don't know what you're actually applying to do."
"Even when you finally get an interview, there isn't much clarity around what the job is."
Management feels it isn't Management's job to be able to help Management's employees when their employees are overwhelmed or need help.
There is no work life balance because you're expected to work until the daily work is finished even if it takes 10 hours that day but Management leaves at 2pm.
You only start to get help when Management feels Management look bad.
Working in the branch was much better than working in Management's back office.
Worst job I ever had.
Not customer or employee focused..
The regional management in Cincinnati is only focused on widgets.
Not you as an employee and definitely not what's best for your customers.
You will be asked to push products on customers that customers don't want or need.
And don't you dare get sick or have a death in the family.
customers don't have time for that.
"Also, be prepared for The regional management in Cincinnati to just make up policies out of the blue that are not in writing anywhere and are not used by any other region."
P.S your job can be eliminated at any time without warning.
Great work/life balance.
I have been this perk from home for about 4 years so this perk is the best perk to get.
"I go into the office 2 times per month, but not all departments get this perk."
Getting a 1-2% raise each year is nothing exciting to say the least.
Benefits are good though including vacation time.
Great if you have little to no experience.
This company is great for individuals with little to no experience in retail banking.
In the beginning This company had to stay one a month until 7:30.
"If your numbers are not where your numbers want your numbers to be, be prepared to stay twice a month."
Compensation is not enough for the pay.
My manager was great
but This company had no support from higher ups!
fast paced and goal oriented.
Great customers to serve and friendly co-workers.
You must be able to handle even the most difficult customer.
If you have a genuine love for people this may be a good fit for you.
shut down the retail mortgage division in GA and North Florida and laid all of the retail MLO's off..
this bank have a very tough time outside of this bank's main footprint states which are the Midwest.
"Have not made much of a dent in GA, AL, FL, etc."
this bank will probably end up exiting the Southeast to focus on this bank's better markets
this bank teller supervisor.  
this bank is a pretty ok company to work for.
My branch was in an awesome location.
"Even though my branch had a high turnover, I had the opportunity to work with some great people"
Programs to help you advance from within are a great help..
"Decent place to work, benefits sucks!"
And I'm not sure why they expect us to dress up so much especially since many workers don't even see clients from behind the teller line.
"The bonus system is pretty competitive and some are unfair, like not being able to get credit for people who you know, even if you are the one who found the need."
You should be able to just refer to another co-worker.
Nice place to work.
I loved working for this bank.
this bank are a great company and I would recommend that you apply here.
Once your in your in and the sky's the limit.
You are promoted from with-in a lot.
In all I was there for 10 years and resigned for other reasons.
But I would work for this bank again.
Good company.
Overall is a good company to work with.
"this bank, needs to improve employee benefits and pay rate ."
Upper management needs to get closer to lower associates and share common goals
this bank.  
this bank is a great place to work at because this bank care.
If you have a family to raise financially it may not be the best move to make due to the salary of a teller.
this bank has a great 401k and great benefits.
Far better choices.
"Low pay, lack of any care for employees, always under-staffed by choice."
In some cases they couldn't even open branches because they did not have adequate staffing and would pull resources from managers who could keep managers who could keep their staff intact's staff intact.
Filled with upper management who only care about upper management who only care about themselves and are career bankers and are career bankers.
Zero ability to see big picture.
Worst employer of my accomplished career.
Good place to work.
The supervisors were great.
"Would go back if had a chance to, the pay was good for starting a new job."
"And the benefits were also good, 401k also very nice."
Good place to work for entry level.
Good place to work if you want an entry level job hard to advance beyond a certain point.
Unless you are willing to move to Pittsburgh it is hard to find jobs past a certain level.
Love this company.
this company is amazing to work for.
"I am a college student, and this company work great around my schedule."
"The work-life balance is amazing, this company care about you as an individual and understand we have a life and family outside of work!"
Excellent entry-level broker dealer positions.
"Due to the larger size of the company compared to other regional banks and bank broker dealers, there are a multitude of job opportunities available."
the company does a good job of growing employees and promoting from within.
Downsides include a less-than competitive compensation structure and having to drive & park downtown.
Leadership has no clue.
I was making monthly incentive and when you got on the list for CD REVIEW you were on your way out thats what happened in march 2019 they let go 25% of there workforce just when business was picking up??
Now all the other employees are working long hours and MANDATORY OT..
REALLY WHAT HAPPENED TO A WORK LIFE BALANCE??
this bank Is an excellent company to work for.
"Although I was in a contractor role, this bank was an excellent company to work for."
"Friendly atmosphere and this bank has many core values that are employee focused, including work and life balance."
I would highly recommend!
This is a sales position..
I was sold a completely different job at the interview.
"The promise was made of quick advancement and easy bonuses, none of which was true."
"They will tell you it's not a sales position, but it is."
Training is minimal before they turn you loose in the branch.
"You wind up calling for support more often than you'd like, making your customer doubt your service."
Processor.
"I've been Processing for just over 3 years however, was never really trained to process and/or knowledgeable about the products & services, which with speaking to the borrowers would greatly help, however this does require time to educate all processors for a better customer experience and the maximum loans a processor should have is 30 in a pipe, in order to meet customer & company expectations"
thankgiving pot party.
every coworkers would cook or bring a dish from home and be thankful for having a excellent teams and for hitting our goals.
We also help each other for solving a customer issues.
Good for new and/or career bankers.  
"this bank goes out of this bank's way to set this bank's new hires up for success in banking, be their new hires career bankers or just starting out in the industry."
Always doing right by the client is the cornerstone of working for this bank.
All Bank Operations.
Doing everything to run a branch and all operations while managing and coaching all the employees.
"Assist clients, read reports, analyze reports and trends to help improvement of sales."
Highly driven financial institution.  
this bank is a forward thinking financial institution with upward movement in relationship to the various other large banks of the nation.
this bank prides this bank with great work/life balance.
An okay place to work.
"Days would sometimes be long, and management seemed to make you want to do way more than a loan officer would need to."
"I feel that we would end up processing a lot of the process, and many times having to calculate things ourselves instead of getting help from underwriting."
Inviting community and coworkers.  
this bank is an excellent bank to learn about the financial industry for someone with no experience.
"Excellent customer service for clients, great work-life balance, incentives, etc."
Sales goals can sometimes be unrealistic.
Regional Manager focuses on weaknesses and missed opportunities without congratulating strengths and accomplishments.
"I used to love my branch and the clients and I wanted to advance with the clients, but the clients make it impossible to get a promotion."
"If you are willing to put years of service into one branch, this is the job for you!"
"If you are looking to grow with an organization, then it's possible but only if your are willing to relocate with every step."
No work/life balance and management is cliquey.
"If you enjoy no work/life balance and 'management' that rewards brown nosing, apply."
They are hands down the WORST company I've ever had the displeasure working at.
I cannot think of one positive thing to say.
"Training is horrible, and they penalize you for going past break and lunch to help the customer."
Great place to start your career.
There is potential for a wonderful career for the right person.
You must enjoy a highly regulated industry with strict policies and procedures.
Management is set in Management's ways leaving very little room for improvement on processes.
Co-workers and benefits are the best part of the job.
Diverse workplace with many different projects.
Usually the day will begin with a daily standup meeting to set goals for the day and review what has been done.
Then the day will begin in earnest with a mix of development work and possibly more meetings to discuss requirements and work through outside obstacles.
The hardest part of the job is that there are multiple layers of permissions to acquire so the start of the job is very slow.
Horrible Management.
When you're hired for a job you EXPECT to do a job right??
Well that's not how this bank looks at things.
I understand that you have to help out with certain things but when you don't get the proper training and then you're thrown out to the wolves is terrible.
When you take the proper steps to discuss it you will get blackballed
Great culture..
A great company with excellent culture to work for that takes employee career development serious.
Employees are great and fun to work with.
Good work/life balance.
Great place to work.
Productive and fun place to work at.
Everyone was really easy going and super nice.
It was a great experience.
The management is really strict but The management push you to do your best.
Treasury Management Client Care.
Wonderful Job all around.
Management kept things running smoothly while making it feel fun.
Management just need to pay more and provide better benefits and no one would ever leave.
Good first job with no degree requirement.
It's a sales job.
You have goals and you're pressured to meet goals.
Hours are flexible but I always drew the short end of the stick.
Working every holiday and most weekends.
I'd get maybe 1 off a month.
"I've gone through 3 managers, going on 4 in less than a year."
2 of 3 managers were terrible.
Absolutely terrible.
Great company to work for.
"The problem with most large corporations is that you only as good as the people above you and if you have bad local management making poor decisions, effects the hiring and quality of workers which in turn diminishes the ability to do your job correctly."
Depends completely on management..
How the job functioned depended on communication and management.
Very poor management at this location.
Head teller would tell you one thing and branch manager would say another.
"Manager would assume you knew things and not tell you about changes, like alter your work schedule the day before."
It gets very busy and there is no one to help you a lot of the time.
"Very stressful, there were never enough employees, because enough employees would quit over the stress."
Best place to work in Pittsburgh.
"While you have to seek out your own advancement opportunities, the company culture and compensation is the best in the Pittsburgh area for large employers."
My team was the best but the rest was a nightmare.
I worked for this bank a little over 2 years.
In the first 6 months I could tell the managements was trash.
When I took a dif position I was targeted to get fired.
My cases were being audited when no one else on My team was.
"All of my mis steps were brought to light, until they found something that could get me fired."
My last paycheck was stolen from this bank as they made up some bogus reason as to why they docked my pay.
Great place to work..
"I have responsibility for large, complex and sensitive assigned accounts/portfolio."
Process and/or reconcile varied and moderately complex transactions in accordance with established polices and procedures.
Encouraging management that was open to new ideas from employees.
"Atypical day off tax season was working to improve the departments functions, procedures and process to create a more efficient environment and to mitigate risk and provide consistency throughout the departments."
During tax season it was 6-7 days a week making sure all of the processes where working properly to ensure the departments could meet all tax deadlines.
The culture on my team was one of openness and sharing of ideas to create better processes.
The hardest part was making sure the departments could meet the strict tax deadlines both internally and the ones placed by the taxing authorities.
The most enjoyable part was being part of the leadership team and being able to affect positive change for efficiencies cost savings and mentoring other staff and problem solving issues.
Stay far away.
"New market manager and regional manager, putting employees Down, high turn over now, leadership is now a dictatorship, better have appointments or else the message literally given to management in retail branches."
The requirements of the job daily not realistic.
"The culture was not like this, every employee is miserable, treated like your not a human."
Not worth the salary.
They promote employee development but they promote outside the company.
Not worth the stress
Fast paced intense environment..
The job is high stress but fulfilling.
There are many opportunities for advancement.
"The company places a priority on diversity and inclusion, and work-life balance."
Good company.
"Pay is not up to par Chase pays 18.00 an hour for call center work, but Management is good, monthly insensitive is great I think its up to 850 extra a month super easy to meet goal, customers are pretty easy did not have a lot of angry calls, If you honest with your manager about what is going on personal your manager will work with you on personal issues going on."
Manager will push you in the right direction just let your manager know your goals.
I worked from home they supplied equipment I did have to pay or my own internet which I was given mixed messages on from the start.
depending on shift hours can very.
Upper management don't care.
Upper management just think clients are right all the time an if u speak ur option u get written up on top of clients don't speak for clients's selfs.
I wish i didn't quit because of the money but Upper management stress u out there
Big Bank with small bank feeling.
"The bank has built a culture of small bank homely feeling, while able to be competitive with the bigger banks."
"Florida does differ from the other this bank Market, while its a newer market; Florida has excel at rapid rate."
Old school banking operation.
Solid organization.
Going through some system changes right now.
I would recommend to individuals looking to grow within the banking world.
You can move around fairly easily if you are in the lower level positions.
Awesome Work culture.
Want to work for longer time in TCS
but sometimes we need to grow and need to take further actions for personal development.
Want to work again with this bank in future as full time employee.
Hostile environment.
Never work for them again..
Management hostile and discriminatory.
For example Management brought cake in for everyone to share put cake on back counter.
I had a soda (closed) put on back counter and was yelled at for it in front of customers.
The next day someone else put drink on back counter and nothing said.
For whatever reason I was singled out.
I also never got a raise in 18 months?
has job security with no autonomy.
The culture of this company has become stagnant and is not progressing.
The culture of this company is not a culture where an employee is able to thrive at this time.
Hopefully The culture of this company will progress soon
Stale growth.  
this bank wasn't a bad place to work by any means but biggest complaints would be no salary increases and very little growth opportunity.
Management tends to not be engaged with Management's teams and have very little offer by way of mentorship.
Not a place to recommend.
This is a bank...
With a mortgage company.
Don't be fooled.
There is very little chance this will be a life long move.
Could possibly be a good place for someone who is a 2 yr veteran of the industry or perhaps a displaced MLO suck as someone who took a few yrs off for child bearing etc otherwise not recommended
Good people / Poor system.
I worked as both an associate and a manager.
I enjoyed the camaraderie of the teams and most of the employees.
"As regulations changed and a new system was brought a new system, things went south pretty quickly."
a new system was flawed and a new system was difficult to keep up with.
Just outgrown.
Over 10yrs of my life....
All to be felt unvalued by upper management...
Too many things to juggle...
Job ever changing.
NEVER praised for good work...
Constantly told your not doing enough
Educational Workplace but lacking flexibilty.
Great place to learn new skills as they keep up with technology changes.
However the flexible work environment is not very flexible and constantly changes every quarter depending on what new director thinks new director know best.
Great Company.
Great company to advance in your career.
If you're willing to learn and do things then you're able to advance quickly.
Just like any other place.....you get paid for the quality of work you do!
Good place to start career.
I enjoyed working as a Financial Sales Consultant at this bank.
It is a fairly good place to work with good benefits for employees.
"However, in the department, I worked, there were a lot of turnovers."
Horrible experience.
Training was the best part.
No flexibility with student schedules even though I was reassured by multiple people that wouldn't be an issue during the interview and training period.
"I had to call in sick once due to strep throat and an ear infection, I had a doctors note."
I missed two other days of work due to an out of town funeral and had no access to a phone so I emailed my boss.
4 days later on my next shift I received an email from my boss stating that I had refused to adhere to company policy.
Was fired as soon as I came in and told that the days missed for an out of town funeral would be converted to paid sick leave.
After my boss has been refusing to return my calls after $20 had been deposited into my account I was told by the call center there was nothing anyone could do as my boss had went against company policy.
Livid is an understatement.
"Coworkers were friendly and productive, but I found management's support to be fleeting.."
"At the onset of my tenure, my manager and senior management above seemed very supportive, forthcoming, and positive."
"I did not have any previous experience in a banking environment, but everyone seemed much friendlier and more accommodating than I expected."
"However, I found support to be tenuous when support mattered."
"Although training was very good, there was not sufficient warnings against job-ending errors and infractions (mine included)."
"In my short time, I've seen experienced tellers, bankers, and advisors forced into retirement and terminated with very thin cause to do so."
"It can be a nice place to work, but beware."
well.
very good job to have good for promotions and experience the money isn't the best as they are other banks out there that pay more and are better with bonuses
Disorganized and callous leadership.
"From the CEO down to departmental managers, the leadership team at this bank is a disorganized disgruntled mess that does NOT care about the non-salaried employees."
Very dedicated to customer service..
Best company I have worked for that is dedicated to employee well being and customer service.
Tremendous benefits from Day 1.
Company is large opportunity for advancement.
Has very Strict Service Requirements for promotion is only downfall I see.
Management is terrible!.
This place is a joke!!
There in NO room for advancement!!
"Management is absolutely terrible, Management does nothing to support the staff."
HR & Ethics is a bunch of bologna.
"Don't take anything into consideration, automatically sides with the NEWLY employed manager from BOA whom always puts down the NEWLY employed manager from BOA whom always puts down her employees and talks about them to other employees's employees and talks about her employees to other employees..."
one bad customer service survey will put you in the red for the whole year and one bad customer service survey is held against you for any raises or promotions!
I should know!
I had 18 shops!
17 perfect and ONE not!!
Can't make them all happy!!
But one bad customer service survey was held against me and I was told that I needed to make an action plan to better my client experience!
Save yourself the headache!
"My co-workers, including myself dread going to work everyday!"
It was never like this prior!
We all enjoyed the place we worked!
The keep hiring BOA manager who is trying to turn This place into BOA!
"Great benefits, but my manager clearly didn't want me to advance."
I have only worked here about 5 months but it's an incredibly easy job.
I have been told by every coworker that i am the fastest teller to catch on.
"I talked to my manager about opportunities to advance and at first it was 6 months recommended but not required, then it was required 6 months, then it was 6 months to a year."
I just don't like that although my manager says my manager succeeds when my manager's staff succeeds my manager isn't actually doing anything to help that happen.
my manager also tells me it's because I haven't mastered my position but tells me nothing that I can do to fix that.
The teller lead is also very petty.
"The teller lead doesn't like doing The teller lead's job and takes The teller lead's sweet time greeting drive through, but gets snippy if we don't do it the second it happens."
I think The teller lead's just insecure with The teller lead's position because I honestly don't see how The teller lead is qualified for my position.
"They promote people who don't follow the rules, but hold people back who have been told that they are the best teller there."
It makes no sense.
It's a great job if you don't get bored easily and you don't mind not advancing quickly.
The benefits are great though
and I'm very happy with the multiple health care options and the paid time off.
"Great is you're a Banker...if not, not so great."
Great Bank and great organization if you're a banker.
Otherwise not a great place to work - lack of resources and leadership for peripheral businesses
Classic banking job.  
this bank puts a lot of emphasis on work/life balance and several departments allow flexible work schedules.
"Benefits are competitive, but annual raises are nominal."
"Typical day at work includes lots of meetings with MIS, different areas of your department, and meetings with internal risk partners."
Great company but lots of talk about other employees from superiors.
Great to Work for this bank.
Just wish that mistakes weren't discussed among employees and instead should be addressed and employee even coached on for better understanding.
Great starter job.  
this bank was my first real job.
My manager took a shot with me.
this bank is very sales oriented and focused on the incentive plan verses the actual salary.
"this bank provide great training to this bank's employees , but managers it's kind of figure it out as you go."
CoWorkers are great..
"For the most part, the management team is horrible."
No other words to describe.
When you have the opportunity to have a good manager typically a good manager are beat down and tired.
A sressful workplace for most associates.
Perfect for those who could thrive on stress.
"Though my position was not a stressful one, too many employees from managers to tellers felt too many employees from managers to tellers could be terminated due to excessive unrealistic goals required to be met."
Family oriented.
"Being a single mom, this was the best company i had ever worked for."
"They try to work around childcare, family needs."
They will work movingwith you because for them family comes first.
I absolutely loved my job and was sad to leave
but i was moving.
Management is a gamble and Management decides your happiness.  
this bank has amazing benefits.
Coworkers are awesome.
incentive is sometimes hard to achieve depending on your location.
So that means bonuses aren't as common as bonuses let you believe in your interview.
How you thrive really depends on how your manager trains you.
Wage is really good though.
"Training program is great, long, and full of information."
So if you like a challenge work here!
The Bank as a whole need some changes.
The Bank as a whole's technology and policies needs a upgrade.
Most banks have gone paperless and have mobile keypads.
Management didn't cared about the well being of Tellers or Bankers.
Management primary focus were Tellers's profit proxy.
I have worked so much overtime voluntarily.
I believed my contribution was helping The Bank as a whole.
Instead of a thank you I got disciplined for my contribution.
My former manager had a nasty attitude.
"My former manager was all about Drama, My former manager delayed the Business hours because My former manager was having an argument with My former manager's ex-husband"
Productive positive work place.
This company is committed to work life balance and customer excellence.
I have grown and really flourished professionally during my time here and appreciate the stability of the job.
Great servies for customers but micro manage the heck out of employees.
Great services but employees micromanaged to point of exhaustion.
Lack of leadership in Georgia market makes it hard for employees to care.
"Good benefits, however"
Nice place to wotk.
"I love working in passaic branch this bank, I was a teller peak time."
My manager was great.
Rhe hardest part was explaining customers the need ID to cash a check.
Lack of Management.
"In the beginning, as always, everything seemed to be okay."
My manager was OK but was not the best.
Pretty much let us do whatever we want.
"Since there was a lack of staff, you find yourself doing everyone job."
My manager was let go and this bank had us with no manager for 6 months.
IT'S NOT OKAY!
This caused us to go through many inconveniences and even jeopardize our career in banking.
I had to quit because the regional manager had everything controlled and didn't care about the well being of the employees.
the regional manager only cared about the regional manager's numbers.
Of course every region is different but keep this in mind when applying.
CORE Values.  
"this bank provides excellent core values with an emphasis on integrity, respect, teamwork, diversity, performance and customer focus."
Management is fair and provides tools to move employees forward.
Productive and fun workplace.
"Productive and fun workplace, when I was at this bank till 2011, this bank was really good place to work and this bank makes you feel you are part of the company."
I really missed this bank when I left the company.
this bank makes it difficult to develop outside business.
Restrictive underwriting and poor processing combined with a anti sales culture make it very difficult to develop consistent outside business.
this bank have lost key management as this bank have take away incentive from sales staff
Rewarding Career.  
this bank is an organization that cares about this bank's employees.
"this bank support career growth, provide you with multiple tools to expand your knowledge, this bank offer incredible benefits and this bank work with you so you can find the work/life balance that works for you."
gave me a good knowledge about the financial consultation.
Learned a lot from the Company.
"Giving financial consultation to custom, opening new account, credit cards and all type of loans."
The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customer with customer's financial needs with the best fit for customer
Great 9 to 5.
If you are looking for a job that is very specific in time then this bank is a great 9 to 5p with possibly extra hours on Sat.
if needed.
Never a full day always 9a to 2p.
Higher Learning.
Some of the managers at this bank encourage continuing education.
Satisfying the customer is always number one.
Working with an eclectic group of co-workers is exciting.
Diversity training is one of the best I have seen corporately.
Demanding deadlines.
When I was employed at this bank I was not happy with the amount of pushiness that upper management was giving.
"upper management wanted me to offer every person a credit card, even if every person had previously declined within a week."
An almost great experience.
I loved this company.
I was looking forward to relocating and retiring with this company.
"Although this company claim not to hard sell to customers like Wells Fargo, that was not the case."
"When you achieved your goals, you were rewarded."
I would still be there if I was not a scapegoat for the unethical behavior of my co-workers.
Training.
"Proactivly adjusting part timers's training on feedback but with constant changes, part timers can see lack of information at times."
"Training is full time hours but then after Training its an immediate 20-30 hours a week with little option to get second PT job, best for college students and those needing another job but not for those who need full time quicker than 8 weeks."
Aggressive and goal-oriented.
I am not able to write a very thorough or detailed review due to my tenure at the company being so short.
"That was due to the fact that the project that we were to work on got pulled and a minimum of 18 month delay being put on the project that we were to work on due to the subject matter experts being pulled into another, similar project so one had to take a back seat."
"Nice place, great people."
"The hardest part of the job is feel like they don't understand the priority's, between family and job."
"I learned a bunch about money, credit, mortgages, the process of borrow and more."
I enjoy a lot the people and by able to help the Hispanic people because I am bilingual.
Good place to work.
Overall I thought that this bank was a good place to work.
The people there are wonderful and friendly.
The department that I work in had very helpful people.
this bank.  
"this bank has a great workplace culture and the management is at best, standard."
Has great cross training opportunities for Universal Banking positions but does lack on keeping current employees interested and engage because of turnover.
It was ok.
"It was a entry level job, nothing special about it."
The stress level was big
But it was ok.
they have changed from the pass.
I think they are better now
High pressure to reach sales goals.
This company is driven only by meeting sales goals and expects you to hit unrealistic goals.
Your job performance is sometimes skewed because of third parties in This company not doing third parties in the company's jobs in a timely manner.
Great company to work for!.
"I loved working at this bank, from working at other banks the entire experience is much more rewarding."
"District managers actually know your name, instead of just being another face."
"District managers promote within a lot, which gives more drive for employees to become better and strive for employees's true niche."
Productive work place.  
this bank is by far a wonderful work environment.
Hours are normally 9 to 6 and this bank's company values are wonderful.
I love the fast pace and customer interactions that happen on a daily basis.
Truly a wonderful environment.
Great benefits for new parents.  
this bank has 6 weeks paid parental leave for all new parents.
"Health insurance is about average to what is out there, 401k match and a pension are nice, but overall salary is lacking competitiveness for similar jobs."
Environment is very sales driven and you will be held accountable for not producing sales.
great culture.
great culture needs better pay compensation but a great place to start.
Company culture definitely makes it one of the best places to work and the type of focus they have on the future of banking ensures it will be a bank for the future.
this bank Review.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
"I worked for this bank for 5 years, and would like to return the atmosphere is wonderful and the co workers are great to work with."
Its all about the numbers and i liked my job.
Don't get the flu are lose your voice because you could only get 6 days out that our Calendar year or you need to go on short term disability.
We have a schedule inherence to go by so no bathroom breaks if you're not schedule to have a break.
If you miss your break or lunch at hurts your schedule adherence and your scores go down.
My break times on lunch was different everyday it was even out a point that My schudule start times was different every day to for months.
You get in trouble you don't know why you got in trouble days later or months later.
There was so many Tech issues thats not coded off a responsible for having Tech issues.
I learned more by being on the phones and teach myself than I did from the training.
a lot of information i was told to was wrong he had to figure out alone.
"Customer are at you because of fees, phone supervisors don't want you to ask for help."
Other departments don't want to take designated call and your tl will ignore you if your numbers aren't high.
The people who listen to calls go through calls to find the smallest mistake.
Choose my job if u want to be stress out.
No management support.
"Short staff, and unsafe."
"The this bank name is well know, yet the way businesses is handled doesn't go hand by hand."
"Additionally, the safety was a risky issue since to access the bolt was not protected"
I loved working here!.
Such a good place to work!
Opportunity for advancement.
Managers want you to succeed.
Training is amazing!
I definitely recommend working here.
I had to leave due to health issues and they don't offer part time
stressful job.
call center for a bank - stressful.
you can get near perfect scores but they will find a way to pick at you.
you are told there is no script -- then are told you aren't saying the words they want to hear.
Varies on office.
Program was not very well organized and had a hard time retaining any talent whatsoever.
"Pay is below average, slow pace of work in office I was in."
Hours are not bad at all.
Fun workplace.  
this bank is a well-balanced company.
Things to consider are as follows: a very diverse company.
"Very good benefits, competitive salary and up-to-date technology."
HIt or Miss.
I have been very successful here.
Avoid working with Pam in The Montgomery county Area.
They point out more of negative impact than Recognizing success.
There are a lot of positive people willing to help you.
going no where.
poor place to work no compassion for the employees.
enough said.
the management was more interested in the numbers than the employees or even the customers...
"A work culture that empowers you as the success driver, celebrates diversity, promotes volunteerism, and encourages engagement."
They have created a culture that empowers you to seek out training.
As well as position yourself for career advancement with well defined career path guides.
Love.
Love it at this bank.
Pay is very competitive.
Very good company to work for.
Very customer focused and truly cares about the customers and also employees.
Very good about promotion within!
Ousted to get someone else in.
"Don't see why after so many years working there, they hired a person (BOA) who was not fit for the job."
The only thing a person (BOA) who was not fit for the job wanted to do was clean up house so that a person (BOA) who was not fit for the job can bring in others.
"Was not even out the door, when a person (BOA) who was not fit for the job already posted my position, weeks ago."
It will do.
My manger is great!
Some are not so much.
Promotions are pretty much prepicked for any advancement opening and the salary could be higher.
Things should be more fair across the board.
It was alright work place.
Consistently late and can not keep personal life out of business.
Manager wasn't around.a lot of gossiping.
i did learn how to cash all types of checks.
The hardest was learning how to cash bonds.
Branch Management. /As
"a leader of one of the larger City locations my daily responsibilities consist of leading my Team in sales results, cash management, proficiency in operations, coaching and developing & Human Resources."
I enjoy my Team and partners immensely and the hardest part of my job is when disciplinary action comes to play
Think twice before you go to this bank.
Let me start by saying...
I was not fired and I do not have an axe to grind with this bank.
I spent a few years there and this bank was one of the most highly disorganized places to work with unrealistic goals.
this bank will promise you the world but never deliver on this bank's end of the bargain.
When I was there the turnover was the worst I have ever seen.
this bank could not keep anyone staffed.
this bank moved new leadership down from Pittsburgh to change the direction of this bank.
new leadership could careless about the employees.
new leadership only care about hitting goals at ANY cost.
The entire state of NC is ran by people who treat the employees like livestock.
people who treat the employees like livestock use you and dispose of you when you no longer hit the unrealistic goals.
people who treat the employees like livestock will write you up and fire you at the drop of a hat.
this bank has almost no market share in The entire state of NC but this bank will expect you to produce the same numbers as your counterparts in Pittsburgh.
Makes little to no sense.
Everyone that is in a sales role there is miserable and constantly looking for a way out.
I am happily employed at a smaller community bank and could not be happier.
Please think twice before you do the mega bank route.
You will live to regret the mega bank route.
My branch was good the rest was bad.
"Micromanagement badly, my manager was so stress out that my manager couldn't do my manager's job so my manager was in so many phone calls that my manager need to delegate, we have so unnecessary dally phone calls, working there is the worst and the regional manager in Florida the worst."
Training is a joke and you do something good nothing happened but if you do something bad or not reach your goals the whole world knows about it!!!
Trust take my advice so not work there.
To me worst place to work.
Great leadership and empowerment of employees inspire achievemet.
Clear focus and commitment on employee development to prepare for next level opportunity and contribution.
Numerous strategies in place to provide a world class customer service and sales experience.
They basically treat you like children....
It was mostly my trainer/facilitator that turned me off after I accepted my new position.
"First off, I was expecting the typical call center environment, but I was not expecting the whole brainwash theatrics regarding how rewarding it is to work for $15.00 an hour (which is still considered poverty level) and how much this bank and this bank's CEO want you to succeed and move up within this bank and its CEO's company."
"Of course, working for someone else will always keep them at the top, and you as a replaceble employee, so please spare me."
"Anyways, my facilitator talked about how micromanaging is what they do not do - that was a lie."
my trainer/facilitator literally admitted to moving/zooming our cameras around during virtual training in order to see if we were on our phones and/or doing other things.
"One day, my system froze, and I could not click my camera back on when we returned from break, so I told my trainer/facilitator (via phone) that I was here but may have to restart my computer due to my computer being frozen."
my trainer/facilitator responds passive aggressively by stating 'we returned from break a few minutes ago but thanks for telling my trainer/facilitator'.
"Ma'am, we returned from break at 9:48AM."
It is now 9:50AM.
I tried to get my computer to work for 2 minutes before saying anything; sorry if 2 minutes was too long.
They basically treat you like children by constantly threatening to report those two minute 'tardies' to the Line of Business.
Who really cares?
The only thing I am glad about is that I did not accept a full time offer.
"That way, I do not spend all day working a position I am unhappy with."
Use my new position until you find something better (or finish school - more...
Not worth it..
Company offers a good pay grade for what seems like an easy job.
Literally just getting yelled at all day about things that policy won't let you fix for things.
Stuck in one position for a year before you can move to a different area.
Managers never want to help with anything.
Fair Enough.
The people who work at this bank are what makes this bank great.
It's a shame that this bank doesn't put more value on The people who work at this bank's human capital.
"Instead of reporting this bank's billions of net gain every quarter, maybe this bank should work on fair pay for all this bank's employees."
Great to learn all the different loan types.
Nothing positive to say about all the different loan types.
It was a great opportunity to learn the mortgage business however this bank had a lot of Racist and friend based promotions on the operation end of the business.
On the servicing end of the business it was more diverse.
Okay place to work.
It seems with this company if you do less than your job is described you are bowed down to.
But for those who pick up the slack of others and bust those who pick up the slack of others and bust their butts's butts you don't get ahead instead you are treated like garbage.
Good compensation.  
this bank is a great place to work with outstanding benefits.
There is a family type atmosphere that is contagious from the second you walk through the door.
Overall great starting place for young professionals.
"I had a great experience during my internship at this bank in which I was able to shadow many different positions and partners within this bank, and was given many great experience opportunities that I otherwise might not have had."
"Great place to work, management is not where management should be.. I love my job."
The pay was great and the benefits weren't that bad either.
my job lacked management and consistency.
There were too many chiefs and not enough Indians and no one controlled my job.
The employees act like children and the drama is unbearable but no one controls the drama.
None.
Nothing good to say about this bank.
No work life balance.
"As a branch manager you are expected to work 6 days a week, you are expected to make up for the sales under-performing branches don't make, and if you develop a good employee, expect a good employee to be moved to another location."
Workplace friendly people.
I learned how to organize my time.
Management was nice and helpful.
Work place culture was friendly The hardest part of the job was the goals.
The most enjoyable was achieving goals per day
Stressful...tellers are forced to sell products.
"I liked being a teller, however this bank forces tellers to push products on every single customer, even those you would see ever day."
"Tellers should be able to provide customer service, not pushing products the customers don't ask for or want."
To this day I have flashback nightmares of my manager criticizing our work.
For this my manager paid a full time teller 9$ an hour.
"Benefits were good, as Benefits should be at a large company."
"Every day we had a morning meeting on performance, what to push to customers, and this bank calls customers for feedback on employee performance and if you got less than 5 out of 5 you were not doing good enough."
"Also, as a teller, we had to cold call customers after work periodically to sell customers financial services."
Benefits.  
this bank provides opportunities to grow in your career and benefits to support the initiative.
"Unfortunately opportunities to grow in your career and benefits to support the initiative are generally located in the larger areas with a higher concentration of employees, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."
"Cincinnati does not have a high enough concentration of employees to have access to benefits such as, sick child care, on-site lunch facilities, etc."
Typical day.
I manage the day to day work flow of our department.
I coach consultants accordingly.
I support customer and service partners by helping to answer inbound calls.
Productive workplace.
I've learned to Work faster on the computer.
The hardest part of the job is trying to keep all the customers satisfied.
Easiest is giving all the customers ways to be more established financially
Productive with very stressful work with no pay increase to match level of work that was expected of me each day.
I have been with this bank since this bank was formerly bank N Bank
and I was displaced in 2014
and now I have the fun of it happening again.
I need to work.
Wants you to enjoy being at work..
Lots of activities to ensure department community atmosphere.
Over and above during Customer Appreciation Week.
"Holds a slight standard of perfection regarding promotions, but will allow you to cross-train as well as take on additional tasks."
Fast paced highly secure work environment.
*
Constant changes- company and environment.
*
High goals.
*
Micro management.
*
Friendly environment.
*
Emphasis on customer satisfaction.
*
Small opportunity for advancement unless willing to relocate
"Great Pay, Amazing boss."
"I was a Loan Closer with this bank I loved my boss, Amazing boss did not micromanage, and Amazing boss was encouraging."
The pay I received while I was there was a good pay rate per hour.
"Job security however leaved much to be desired, they would cut anyone and everyone at the drop of a dime."
They would not even offer other positions within this bank before getting rid of you.
Other than that it was a good experience.
Good workplace.
Direct managers are wonderful to work with.
My manager takes an active interest in my development with my career and me personally.
We are given 40 hours per year paid to do sanctioned volunteer projects.
This contributes to a positive work life balance.
Horrible.
Pros: - My co-workers was the main reason why I didn't leave right away.
My co-workers were nice and helpful.
Cons: - Management was a mess.
We didn't have a manager for 6+ months.
-
The branch that I worked at was very busy and under-staffed. -
Always running out of supplies.
"For instance, deposit and withdrawal slips, pens, cups, etc. - No paid time off for part-time until you've worked there for a year."
- They'll also fire if you do one thing wrong without any warnings.
I've seen it happen to two of my co-workers.
Managers.
Every manager knows one another.
Can be good can be bad.
Bad when trying to promote yourself but manager doesn't agree...working in a small environment has its challenges
Stay away from this bank!.
I have worked in the mortgage industry for 20 years.
And this was the worst experience of my entire career.
this bank is unethical and lack any sense of moral compass.
The way this bank treat this bank's employees is actually illegal.
And several ex-employees have filed lawsuits against this bank.
Stay far far away from this bank.
Sales not Management.
Position in store (Giant).
"Long hours, typically short staffed."
"Focus was on sales, approaching shopping customers, ridiculous activities in front of branch to stop Giant customers."
Emphasis on selling instead of employee development or customer service.
Massive pressure from upper management to meet sales goals.
If you are looking for a respectable banking job this it NOT a respectable banking job.
Im Surprised this company are still in business.
There is so much to say about my experience with this company but to sum it up.
this company does not set you up for success at all.
I personally did succeed but at the cost of my health physically and mentally.
The training does absolutely nothing to prepare you for the actually job.
The training basically just shows you the systems you will be working with.
THATS IT.
For the 3 years I was there management changed the processes about twice a month; sometimes more.
I am all for being flexible with change
but it was just ridiculous after a while.
On top of it management want you to keep up with every wishy washy change management made and reprimand you for every mistake.
Every day I felt like I may lose my job if I'm not perfect.
this company also changed the incentive structure every year to make it more difficult to bonus.
"I was a Processor and there were just so many things outside out control, but we got blamed for every thing that happened."
I would never recommend anyone work here and I will never work for them again.
I honestly feel this company did not care about this company's customers and every decision this company made was a guess.
this company have all these kind of special projects testing out new processes or systems but when it comes down to implementing real feed back this company don't listen to the people who actually do the job every day.
"Also, as an employee so many managers have favorites."
Avoid the this bank aml department at all cost!.
I worked for this bank as an AML Investigator in the Pittsburgh office (1st Side Center) for a number of years.
I've also had similar titles at another bank and have been a professional in Risk Management for over a decade.
"At first, I thought the work culture was friendly and the program seemed fairly organized."
the this bank aml department was expanding the this bank aml department's AML program considerably and hiring more investigators and support staff to handle a large increase in case volume.
"Within six months, the this bank aml department had the new hires working 12+ hours a day and were expected to handle case volumes far beyond what the vast majority of people could handle."
"During the worst of it, you were expected to clear about 10-16 case in a week."
"From what I was told, prior to the case increases and hiring push, investigators were expected to work between 5-8 cases a week."
There were a few dips in the case volume moving forward but largely the average that you would work in a given month increased as time when by.
"All the while, there was little or no improvements to the policies and procedures that would help us do the work faster and with more efficiency."
"In other words, you were expected to do a lot more with less."
this bank tries to solve any problem by hiring more managers.
The most frustrating part about working there is most of the Team Leads and Managers are absolutely terrible and all Managers care about are metrics.
Some of the stuff I've heard managers say I can honestly say I've never come across in my entire professional life.
It was like living in a cult.
the Team Leads may have been good at clearing - more...
Schedule Adherence.
"Don't do Schedule Adherence unless you have no kids, don't get sick, running late by 1 min!!!"
Schedule adherence is unrealistic if you are stuck on a call during your 15 minutes you risk being off your adherence and no bonus they give you!
You get the same calls all day sometimes from the same folks with their online banking system causing customers to be locked out multiple times a week and there is no script to follow.
Oh yeah
and if you want to last there you must not be late or miss days the first 90 days!
Good place to start career.  
this bank was a good place to start my career and gain training amd opportunities.
There are really great people working here.
There are numerous departments in which to gain knowledge and transferable skills.
this bank does not care.  
this bank Does not care about this bank's employees or clients.
this bank solely care about saving face.
this bank will are incredibly dishonest and cowardly.
Do this bank not communicate any important information professionally.
Just ok.
"Overall my job was great , very friendly customers ."
Nice and steady days easy job.
But the BM was very rude and did a lot of favoritism.
Your good work doesn't get recognized!
Not flexible with requesting off.
Get in trouble for calling out!
Pay and benefits are good.
Environment sucks.
"Constant changes; work, co workers, mgrs."
Hard to advance.
Redundant work.
HR does not care about HR own 'polices' nor enforcing it's own 'polices'.
Good luck staying on for any real period of time.
Green company but low pay.
"Average employer, not much can be really said about the front line."
"It's easy to hit sales goals if you are in an affluent area, but still doable in a low income area."
"Management was not great, but varies from branch to branch."
Red tape was a little bit much with very little reasoning behind Red tape.
Work here if you hate yourself..
"If you love sitting at a desk listening to the same five songs on the radio eight hours a day, dealing with entitled rich old people who get frustrated when you take more than half a second to complete entitled rich old people who get frustrated when you take more than half a second to complete their transaction's transaction, and being micromanaged by narcissistic coworkers pretending to be your manager, this bank is the place for you!"
Great place to work.
The team I had the pleasure of working with were supportive of myself and my role.
Were always willing to develop my skillset to better enhance my performance and conversations with my client.
My bank family were always aware of others and made sure home life was balanced with work life.
3 stars.
you have the option to make lateral moves within bank but moving up does not seem possible unless you have seniority.
micro management has become the way of life.
"Tactical, next flashy thing management style."
Management is engrained in the tactical day to day operations and has no vision or strategy.
Management speaks of work/life balance as something that will come in the years to come if we work hard today.
It takes 4-5 months to get an approved work effort approved to begin.
"So after getting approval, you have another 4-5 months of getting approvals before you can begin."
Cold calling Nightmare.
"My daily duties consisted of: answering phones, client servicing, cold calling clients, teller, payment processing, sales positioning, referrals, data entry, confidential filing, notary, applications for: loans, checking, savings, and credit cards."
I learned money management skills and the genesis data base along with being NMLS certified.
Management was not encouraging and pushed sales goals on you everyday.
Hardest part of my job was not being able to make important decisions.
It all had to go through the manager and cooperate.
The best part about my job was the experience and the clients.
Lacking in leadership.
Overall I found that this bank and this bank's management team have yet to figure out that management and leadership are not interchangeable.
"Further, the total lack of work/life balance makes working for this bank less than ideal."
"Still, compensation and retirement benefits are excellent."
Productive.
"Provide sales management and leadership to Branch Managers and Branch Managers's teams including operations, training, sales coaching and service."
Instill behaviors and lead activities that drive both employee engagement and growth
Work.
"Entry level job, there is a high demand to keep up with the work load."
Zero tolerance job.
You must be able to multi-task and always be prepared.
Assistance is there if needed.
Great Company.
I loved working for this bank.
I was able to learn and grow in different positions.
It was challenging but enjoyable.
My only issue was the location and the robberies and attempted robberies that happened while I was there.
It was difficult to relocate so I had no choice but to leave this bank.
Great bank.
I worked for this bank for 8 years and loved this bank.
this bank are constantly training and making sure everything you need you have.
There are so many opportunities within this bank to strive for.
It works for Me.  
this bank is a great corporation to work for.
"Management is great, but the area for advancement is at a minimum."
You never know what type of day you will have at this bank.
It changes from day to day.
Personal Experience.
"This does not speak for the organization as a whole, but more specifically to the department within which I worked."
"Due to regulatory pressures, the risk framework has swung so far to the right that it became unstainable to keep pace with the initiatives, and with the demands from operational risk management leaders."
Professional environment.
A busy place to work with wonderful people surrounding you to support you and encourage your success.
Helping customers with customers's banking needs and helping branch employee be successful is a rewarding experience.
No. ABSOLUTELY the worst management.
"If you want to be dehumanized, disrespected , dishonored, overworked, underpaid and set up for FAILURE, please work here."
Great Place..
This is a great place to work.
Really try to make sure every employee has work life balance.
They offer great benefits as well.
Pay is competitive to others in market.
A great company to advance and retire from..
I was a loyal and dedicated this bank employee who was displaced due to expense reduction and management restructure.
I was a company ambassador and planned on retiring from my company.
I have the utmost respect for this bank even though my position was eliminated.
busy.
It was an extremely fast paced environment.
the managers walked around behind you with clip boards and marked off things you were doing wrong.
there was never praise just what you did wrong.
Work from home was great!.
I love the work from home schedule.
But they need to invest on the job training and management training.
Management only cares about the company not employee.
Great Place.
Love working here.
Great work life balance.
Internal advancement opportunities are great if you work hard.
I've always had amazing managers and coworkers.
Good People.
There were a lot of nice and knowledgeable people who were willing to help teach new employees.
"Some of the management were good to work for, but there were some exceptions."
Good Place To work.
Great Job Work/Life Balance.
One of the Company's that pay very competitively.
Management could use some work but over fine.
Also great benefits for those with family/single
Great Job.
Job is great.
Management isn't the best.
Management push numbers
and are phasing out Tellers.
At my branch people stay in people's position for long term leaving little room for advancement.
Loved working with people.
"Answered call went over balances, deposits, withdrawals, on line banking."
Debit card Fraud bank transactions.
I learned how to go over bank transaction.
Workplace was a large open call center where I sat beside other employees.
The hardest thing was telling people people had a negative balance.
Learned a lot about how to sale.
When i first got hired to work for this bank i didn't know how to sale.
"But, as time went on i began to get better at being a sales associate and learning the techniques of how how to sale through coachings."
A go to work environment.
This is an establishment that will help you grow and develop many professional traits and skills.
The culture of the employees along with the ongoing training pushes employees to excel in employees's careers.
Meet A Lot of New People.
A typical day in the retail banking entails a great detail of interaction with clients.
Staff may build rapport with clients who frequently visits clients who frequently visits their particular location's particular location.
this bank Laid Me Off For No Good Reason.  
"this bank Laid Me Off For No Good Reason, but it's ok because this bank're a big corporation and sometimes it be like that."
this bank really do.
I'm still working for the man.
Ok. OK place to work at.
If a developer is used to taking additional pressure then this is the place to come and work.
Apart from pressure rest everything is fine.
People tend to extend People's contracts on a very regular basis.
Great place.
My manager made the branch feel like home.
I had many opportunities to grow as professional.
"I was promoted based on my work ethic, demeanor and production."
"Basically, if someone put the work, this bank will recognize"
"Eh. Nothing, but politics."
"All they care about are credit card sales, not the individuals they have working for them."
"If you come in from outside of this bank, your pay will be a lot better than being there for a long time and moving up."
Only positive I have is maternity leave is 10 weeks + 6 weeks parental time.
Good Experience.
"I have had experience being the interim manager for my branch, so I am familiar with handling the logistics side of operating a branch, in terms of: ordering funds for the cash processes from our vendor, ordering supplies for my branch, as well as making sure our files and procedures were being followed and adhered to at all times."
High Pressure Sales.
Constant pressure to sell and make cold calls.
"Excessive reporting , micro managing."
Constant staff shortages.
Training embarrassingly lacking; focus is on sales conversation but poor product and process training.
Lots of online training modules but no time to complete online training modules.
Good company.
Company is good to Company's employees.
a lot of advancement available.
work pace is fast.
Company train well before Company place you.
A lot of company inclusion.
The job.
The job was not recent and couldn't rate The job.
A lot has changed both locations I worked at.
Management has changed and so has the face of this bank.
The way this bank do banking isn't the same as it was almost 5 years ago.
Excellent managers thats will to help with everyday projects and goals.
Timeframe for advancement dwindled away over time.
New hires would start at same level as senior reps.
The most recented promotions were given to rrps with less experience and time with company.
Not a good place to work if you have anytyme of mental disability.
I worked for this bank for 5 months and was bullied the whole time working there.
I was scold about things that this bank's own employees for more then 2 years were violating.
The training is horrible and if this bank didn't like you that was even worst.
this bank leave you in the middle of transactions you don't know how to complete and then blame you for making the mistake when the head teller didn't show you how to complete the mistake.
All the head teller did was click things on my computer without showing me how its done and when I asked for help this bank always had an attitude.
I learned about important cash limits 4 months into my employment.
The other tellers all did things that violated this bank policies and when I made the mistake I was yelled at when I was just doing what everyone else does due to lack of training.
I had a Panic attack in the middle of a transaction because once again this bank left me with something I wasn't trained in and got yelled at by my manager on why am I crying and why cant I calm down .
That made my panic attack worst so I had to walk out of the branch.
There is a lot of gossip going around and favoritism
Good place to work..
Just stay on their good side and out of trouble and you will succeed.
"Follow the rules, and do as you are specifically told."
A good place to work otherwise
Fun and Challenging Opportunities.
My time at this bank has been unforgettable.
I'm thankful for having been provided the opportunity to provide quality service to such an enthusiastic company.
"Stressful, long hours, low pay."
"As a teller supervisor, you are expected to not only do your role but those of the assistant manager and manager as well."
But for just about the same pay as a teller.
There is NO work-life balance.
"And If you have small children, this company is not the place for you."
"Being short staffed, you have to work open to close, six days a week."
"But then when you end up with overtime, overtime's an issue."
Amazing Company.  
this bank gave me the opportunity to grow to a better individual I am today.
this bank had great benefits for this bank's employees and this bank valued hard working employees.
this bank is a great company to work for if you are looking for growth.
Great place to work.
Great place to learn multiple roles if there is opportunity and openings.
Good benefits and decent compensation.
Great fast paced atmosphere which made days go quickly.
Solid company.
most enjoyable part of the job are the clients and co workers.
The issues are that management is unclear about management place in the retail world.
Unable to balance fee generation vs services offered and chooses not to compete with regional competitors.management has a focus on sales culture but lacks the service component.
Clients consistently change due to lack of understanding and assistance with services.
Motivated company.
"Motivated company with great benefits, compensation and recognition."
"Company promotes a good work / life balance, while promoting career advancement within."
"Laid back work atmosphere, core values were great."
Handled many things with clients in regard to clients's money.
"Ran basic teller transactions, dealt with loans, mortgages, insurance, and wire transfers."
Built a book of business and cold called clients
former employee - BSSA.
one of the worst if not THE worst places I have ever worked in my life.
The 'management' was a joke.
"I was told, in front of my fellow co-workers and customers that I was 'a liar, couldn't do anything right, couldn't admit to wrong doings' etc."
I was 'excused' when confronting The 'management' about my issues with how I was being treated and I actually took the first job that came my way with a severe pay cut because I could not take the first job that came my way with a severe pay cut anymore.
I almost walked out twice and I have never walked out of a job in my life.
This company is a joke.
I tell customers and future employers to run don't walk away from This company.
no good will come from your time here.
worst place I've worked in 40 years.
"continually increasing workload, little or no raises, paid sinificantly below midpoint of job range for 40 years experience, refused medical coverage."
protocol changes with little or no direction
If you want to get your foot in the door to something else or better to take somewhere else.
"No life balance Interference with personal and family life Poor hours and rotations Hideous system for bidding better shifts, holidays etc Lack of occasional absence for year timeframe."
"Entirely too many unnecessary systems etc to get the job done Job way too lenient for supervisors Analyst do the majority Have to clock your paychecks, claims and other means Expectations to high Expect you to tolerate and deal with rude and disrespectful customers rude and disrespectful customers don't pay enough to be a punching bag rude and disrespectful customers will review a call to find Anything possible to coach on when a customer complains we're in a business where a customer will always be a complain rude and disrespectful customers make it hard with no peace of mind"
It's too stressful and a brain fryer People come and go only advancement is working at home which rude and disrespectful customers will do the impossible to make sure you do not go home If home rude and disrespectful customers will find a reason to bring you back The changes are ridiculous no weekends and holidays off The list is ongoing rude and disrespectful customers can not match what I am a custom too salary
wise
"it's a pay cut only good thing is benefits get in and get out once you have accomplished your goals, you can meet great people and develop great friendships!"
Great atmosphere.
"Loved working at this bank, they made sure there was a great work life/ home life balance, pay was good, and the atmosphere there was always positive, highly recommended working there"
great place to work.
excellent for those post high school thru BA degrees.
compensation for education above BA is unrecognized.
A day of employment consist of 2 breaks/ 1 lunch.
flexible scheduling based on department.
Lots of training in bank servicing.
Partially diverse.
pushing for more diversity however it starts from the top > down; with a widespread of backgrounds!
Work life balance.
Good place to work for family good hours with no weekends ability for time off for family appointments or kids events.
Room for growth and good quality time for family
Horrible interview experience.
The person conducting interview to work for this company from home was extremely rude and disrespectful.
It was the first contact live I had with this company and it was over the phone.
"The first person you talk to in every company is like the letter of presentation of every company , it is like the welcome to that place, but if the 'welcome' is a really bad one, the first impression is 'you are not welcome here', so who would like to work at company like that?"
"No one , right ?"
I think nobody deserves such mistreatment.
"I believe on being nice with people, not rude like her."
And on top of that I received an email saying that I wasn't hired.
"So , I not only wasted my time"
but I had to go through such an awkward situation because I never experienced nothing like this before in any of the of companies I applied for.
Very stimulating and intelligent group.
Always lots of work to do and management pushes you to always do better.
Very competitive environment with little opportunity for growth.
Definitely a little more milder than investment banking for a bulge bracket.
Work Life Balance.
"I loved working for this bank, this bank promoted work life balance, And allowed me to work remotely."
I was able to focus on my pipeline and deliver my goal monthly
Culture is lacking.
Culture is lacking and the pay is not desirable nor are the raises.
"Great benefits, vacation etc."
Too many meetings and lack of concern and assist where needed.
Lo's's stay away.
If you are a loan officer stay away from this bank.
this bank are a total mess on all fazes of the loan process and nobody who makes a salary gives a dam about Lo's's.
No support at all from management.
relaxed slow work place (Depends on you are).
Work is okay.
The job is for someone who is good at selling and making referrals.
"If you are not good at selling, do not join The job."
"They pressure you to sell accounts and if you don't meet requirements, you risk getting fired."
Strict company.
"Overall, work is slow at times but can get busy at times."
Boring job.
Sitting all day.
this bank Sales Assoc..
A typical work day consists of attempting to get business with your clients.
You service your clients in the branch but the goal is to uncover more opportunities for financial business.
My consultative selling skills have strengthened.
The hardest part is winning business if a client is not looking for a particular product.
The most enjoyable part is making a difference in someone's life with their finances.
Talent and job performance often overlooked.
Good benefits and pay.
Talent and job performance often overlooked and good employees are sacrificed for those whose performance and knowledge are lacking..
Teller.
I assisted customers with there daily transaction.
I also would make suggestion on customers's financial needs as well as lobby engage.
To make sure customer were assisted fast
Really love my job.
"There are a lot of things about a sales job to hate, but the coworkers, management support, benefits, and salary make my job worth it."
"I don't like making sales calls, that's my biggest grievance!"
Great benefits.
Every job has Every job's ups and downs so depending on which supervisor you get will determine your longevity for Every job after you pass the initial initial training and probation you have your health benefits which are really great
A great place to work..
The work culture is what you make of The work culture.
I love building client relationships and helping folks with folks's financial well being.
The hardest park of the job is making sure that all procedures are followed to ensure the safety and well being of our clients and fellow employees.
Fun and easy going place.
"Very nice company, with great values and goals."
"Company is trying to find new and innovative ways to do business, but not all of new and innovative ways to do business hep making job easy and productive."
Great place to work!.
"I love the environment and the people, just not the best fit for the moment."
the environment is great and the benefits are exceptional and perfect for a full time employee.
Good Company.
Good company great opportunity to advance as long as you do your job.
your not micromanaged there and you have good managers there who have positive things to bring to your advancement & help you and look forward to do so.
Wish I had not left.
Good company!
My job at this bank.
"I work in the Bankruptcy department at this bank, so there's not really a typical day."
"The reason being, is because no one customer's situation is the same."
"However, every day is a learning experience."
"Overall, I find joy in assisting customers in getting there life on track, post bankruptcy."
High paced call center.
The company The company itself is great!!
Amazing benefits.
The hours are horrible and posting out takes forever.
Working from home is an option but you have to pay for the internet and phone.
You are like a desk jockey and can hardly get up.
The attendance policy is harsh.
Flexible but behind the curve..
Pay is lower than the industry.
Horrible management.
Open environment was forced without consulting teams or a consulting firm leads to everyone getting sick.
No privacy.
Lockers like you are 12.
Incompetent managers who don't support agile practices.
Terrible.
"The organization and management are absolutely awful here, HR does absolutely nothing literally so worthless I am not sure why HR even have an HR dept since HR let low end managers make low end managers's own rules set even over the this bank policies put into place."
Even when meeting goals you are constantly threatened about your job and needing to do better even as top performers.
No encouragement whatsoever only negativity.
"this bank, great company to work for.  "
this bank is an awesome bank to work for.
this bank truly car about this bank's employees.
this bank take the time to understand their employees's unique situation.
By allowing flexible working schedules and work from home options.
Great Employer.
I have been with this bank since 2016
and I absolutely love this bank.
Looking for something to do over night or even part time.
I am hoping to find something that
Conservative company.
i had a good an overall good experience working for this bank.
this bank cared about quality of life.
My direct manager was available to help facilitate success
A good learning experience.
Positive customer interactions.
Good management..
I enjoyed working for this bank.
It was valuable learning about banking procedures.
The work atmosphere was relaxed.
I left to pursue other job fields.
Diverse Company.  
this bank was a very diverse company to work for.
The management was very involved and part of the team.
My ability to work from home was a nice benefit to have.
Glad I am gone.
Lots of favortism.
Micromanaged.
Expectations are not realistic.
Raises are tiny.
Negative environment overall.
Every minute of your working day has to be accounted for and measured.
Big brother is watching closely....
A place where you can meet awesome people.
A day in the life at A place where you can meet awesome people.
consists of assisting clients with clients's financial needs.
Supervising and coaching teller team to be the best that teller team can be.
every location is different so get a fill for the manager.
Some location * will leave unknown* but in Georgia is like working in Wayward Pines (look it up)
Too much is left in the gray area as managers discretion.
There were times we worked through the entire day with no lunch.
Ive worked numerous times by myself as a teller which is definitely a security risk.
Great Job over all..
It was a great job overall.
Not particularly easy or hard.
Customers could be challenging.
The team at the branch was the best part of it all.
Would have stayed longer if it wasn't for a personal change.
Relaxed environment.
The experienced bankers on UC's campus can become a little hostile when there is someone new and threatening around.
"But, overall UC's campus's not a bad place to work given you know the right people."
Nice work environment.
Great company to work for.
"Although there was tremendous amount of stress for trying to achieve monthly and quarterly quota's, interactions with customers and my coworkers was a good experience."
The overall environment made everything much more enjoyable.
Excellent benefits upward mobility and many avenues to take within the company.
Great.
Salary was okay
but not as competitive as other places.
The offered an option to work from home on occasion.
My manager was fantastic.
Most knowledgeable and willing to help without procrastinating.
this bank got too big and lost sight of the customer.
Was a good place until changes in leadership.
There is a lot of talk about taking care of the client and employee but somewhere from the top down it was lost.
"Fun workplace, the atmosphere is inviting."
"I love this bank, unfit my time has come to an end with the company."
I am a Competitive worker so for the company to get rid of commission is totally unacceptable.
Average Level Company.
Nothing significant to comment.
Company culture is good and internal security program is robust.
Various lines of businesses have good levels of executive leadership.
Lower level management not as competent.
Decent.
New software package makes work miserable while they try to figured out how to fix New software package.
Management is slow to make changes that can improve the job because there's so much corporate red tape Management have to get through to make even small changes.
Low pay and little chance for advancement.
After 3 years at this bank you are no longer eligible for the management training program.
So if management is your goal maybe look elsewhere.
They only health insurance offered is a high deductible plan which is still around $100 a week/$200 a paycheck for a single person
Bad management is what drives employees away..
Working for this bank was great until the last 6 months of my 11 yrs with the company I had the worst manager.
I was placed with a management team that did not want to be there so that spread and everyone in the branch left.
My last day there I was escorted out as if I was being terminated not resigning.
Prior to that I enjoyed working for this bank and bled blue and orange.
Salary.
Benefits are great.
I worked there for four years and have only made 1K more.
"Obviously, with no performance issues that would deny a raise."
It's a big company.
You are just a number.
Productive Work Environment.  
this bank offers a productive work environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement.
There are constantly jobs being posted in other department of this bank looking to recruit from within this bank.
Not recommended apply with caution.  
"this bank advertise no banking experience necessary but once in training that changes, jobs are given to people with banking background."
Horrible training.
Fast Paced.
Very busy.
Accolades given to the team time and time again but the raises don't match the performance.
Stated that it is merit based
but it is not.
Often times punished for speaking up and the manager has favorites.
Making it obvious.
Diverse with room to grow..  this bank Financial services has a diverse work culture with a frequently changing environment.
this bank Financial services strongly encourages work balance with personal and professional.
My management was very active in growth and enrichment.
Work Place Culture.  
this bank is a great company that places a large emphasis on employee satisfaction and customer service.
Management is constantly identifying ways to improve employee engagement.
decent company.
"not bad to work for, and work life balance is nice."
"The biggest problem with this bank is the slow salaries that are offered to employees and the location move from center city to eastwick pa,"
High expectations and fair.
Good environment if you are an achiever.
Heavy emphasis on sales performance.
"Goal always go higher, which given the limited territory, can continue annually."
To many Chiefs.
"I truly enjoyed the customer's that I worked with at this bank, However the Management that I worked under were less than great."
Manger's's hardly ever in branch and when Manger's were Manger's were unapproachable.
"Everything I learned was either through research on company intranet, Branch support hotline or through coworker's who have been there a long time."
Manger's's would say something to your face and turn and talk to someone else and bad mouth you.
Then you had employee's who would try to take charge of something when employee's who would try to take charge of something when they had no idea what was going on had no idea what was going on.
this bank Cares.  
this bank is a company that truly cares about this bank's employees and customers.
The pay is competitive and The pay is always room to advance in whatever area of this bank that you choose.
Big Brother.
Everything is monitored.
"phone calls, computer activity, email activity, every minute detail."
Understandable to a point - but daunting none-the-less...
Working with this bank.
It is a nice experience and I am glad to work there
but I feel like I need a change in pace.
A typical day is trying to get your number of files done to make sure your not behind.
Work life balance has been rapidly declining.
The job description does not line up with the job requirements.
this bank went through a career development change a few years back.
"The title of the new position was company created, and does not line up with a normal work title."
This makes it difficult to apply for jobs outside of this bank.
There has been significant reduction of staff lately.
Mostly in small amounts with no communication to keep employees in the dark with what is occurring.
"this bank promotes work life balance, however has been slowly removing flex work arrangements."
Merit increase remain extremely low around a 1% cap rate.
Culture.  
this bank for many employee levels allows flexiblw work arrangements.
This is swapped for the need to have to work most nights due to many meeting during working hours for the 1LOD risk areas.
"However, the culture is casual and collaborative so the extra work is usually worth the effort."
Flexible work arrangement benefits rescinded.
Some departments have taken away and/or limited flexible work arrangement benefits that has lead to a mass exit of longtime employees which has severely affected morale
Great place to work.
If I had not had a car wreck and had to leave I would still be workimg for this bank.
"Great training, great perks."
"Caring supervisors, great chances for advancement."
Great Experience with the Experiential team.
Absolutely loved this job had lots of awesome perks and benefits.
Management was absolutely amazing very helpful.
got to go to a lot of exciting environments and test out my skills as a salesperson also learned a lot about marketing.
Review.
I have been loyal to this bank since March 2005.
"this bank has been a good place to work, however this bank make it very hard to cross over into some of the desired departments such as Human Resources."
Good place to work.
"We had a meeting in the am to discuses work for the day, Once the day got started the management had a few meetings and offered little help...……………….."
IT appears to be a nice org to work in within this bank.
We get to do hackathons and other interesting things and this bank is evolving to match current tech.
Not sure what other orgs or customer-facing roles are like.
Beware.
Company makes you bug customers to death on the teller line and will threaten to fire you if you don't click buttons and disposition to every client sales.
If you make a mistake like I did not knowing you made a mistake Company are not behind you as an employer and will fire you so Company don't have to deal with a mistake.
Management do nothing but hang in Management's office all day and play on Management's phones and computers.
Productive.  
this bank is a great place to work.
I'll recommend this company to anyone.
this company are family oriented and flexible.
Over time and shift premiums are offered
Do not work for this company.
I was recently let go for something stupid.
The management is awful and very unprofessional.
You are not allowed to go to the bathroom and The management watch your every move.
You are just another body in a seat.
The goals The management have for calls are very hard to accomplish.
A lot of calls I received were elderly customers and you practically had to push elderly customers off the phone while being nice.
Not to mention being called names by angry customers on a constant basis.
The management does not care if you have any sort of sickness.
Training was a nightmare and we sat in a classroom for 3 weeks.
One of the most important things you learn at the last minute.
Also the material you learn in the classroom doesn't even get used while you're on the call or are told that the material you learn in the classroom is incorrect.
this company do not reimburse you if you work from home.
The management would also pick favorites as well.
Review.  
this bank is a grind.
Up to 300 calls a day with only a minimal break.
The management there is a joke and The management there will be quick to replace you............................
worse place I have ever worked at.
folks were not very pleasant to be around and not helpful at all.
Not somewhere I would recommend anyone to work.
folks micromanage all folks's employees from bottom to top.
Production.
Good Company to work for and very good people to work with.
Management could be better with monitoring staff assignments.
I enjoyed working there too.
productive and team work.
Its a great company to work for and a knowledgable place to learn from.
this bank company give free training lessons to this bank company's employees to teach its employees how to provide a well being financial services.
this bank Teller.
8:15-5:30pm is a typical work day schedule with an hour lunch.
"You learn something new every single day, great customers and co workers."
Can be very fast paced and sometimes challenging.
"Part time has a more flexible schedule, but managers are very understanding and try to have a good work-life balance."
Busy.
"Great company, but the structure of the company is constantly changing."
The policies and procedures change with each loan.
The management team is easy to work with & the staff is very pleasant.
Collborative Work Environment.
Friendly yet professional work environment.
Everyone is willing to help and willingly communicated.
Wasn't there long but got the impression that there isn't much opportunity for advancement.
great place to work.  
"this bank is a great to work, pay is not competitive but the work equals the pay."
"not too diverse, has great core values that I love but was loosely followed by everybody including management."
na.  this bank is a great company to work for and provides a lot of opportunity for those who seek a lot of opportunity.
The compensation could've been better but overall I had a great experience working and growing with this bank.
Super competitive.
Super competitive environment - lots of goals that are very hard to reach in current living area; mandated team meetings and difficult to build camaraderie when forced.
Cashier.
Cashier is a good place to work.
People are friendly and are willing to help for the most part.
There is room to grow if you put the time in.
Peers are friendly depending on branch.
great work place.
"Very relax business environment , dress code."
very supportive mangers and team.
upper managements surprise visits to motivate employees .
Great benefits.
Not bad.
Doesn't count where it matters though..
They did not fully describe benefits and did not fully pay out bonuses and such that were due me.
This ruined the other good things there were about the place.
Always room for change and growth.  
this bank is a good place to work.
Start in an entry level position and move up.
A lot of different opportunities in this bank to move around if you don't enjoy your role.
Management in my area is good.
Limited on branches in the Florida market
very friendly working place.
in my two years working experience I had a wonderful time.
my manager was one of the best person I ever worked for.
this bank was home for me.
every day I looked forward to work at this bank.
Ok company.
"Good place to work, promotion is who you know not what you know."
All federal holidays off and good vacation and sick leave.
Navigating management can be tricky
this bank.  
this bank is a good place to work.
The management on the Mortgage side is very responsive and helpful.
The management on the Mortgage side provide all the support you need to be successful.
Typical Day.
Every morning starts with a quick start to leverage what we plan to achieve.
"From the moment we open the branch, clients are ready for us to process clients's transactions and provide clients with solutions for clients's every day money management needs."
Plenty of Learning Opportunities - Limited Advancement.
Daily Tasks are often so plentiful that you can't keep up with the pace.
"Between 20+ File Prep Assignments, 2 new closing files per day, as well as a processing pipeline to manage."
"If you can't multi task, then this position is not for you."
It was a pleasant place to work..
It was a pleasant place to work from what I can remember.
I learn a lot about the banking industry and wouldn't mind working there or in the banking industry again.
Not A Healthy Work Enviroment.
I was a personal banker for this bank full time.
"The sales goals are impossible, with even the top performers in my branch struggling to even come close to even the top performers in my branch's numbers."
"The training is very minimal and management is reluctant to help, even though banking is a highly regulated industry."
I was verbally abused by my manager on several occasions but was just told that that's how my manager was and to just deal with it.
"On a typically week, you would be making around 60 cold calls to try and get people to make an appointment to come into my branch."
Investments was a big focus for this bank but this bank struggled to find referrals for an FA who would not even speak to the ones this bank could refer over.
I would not recommend starting your banking career with this bank.
Solid employer.
Various locations available across United States.. Is a solid employer.
Various locations available across United States.
Continual learning environment.
Pursues continual process improvement techniques.
Great benefits.
Entry level career starter.
Banking industry was fun to work for with incredible benefits and job opportunities.
Management was incredible and level of responsibilities was appropriate.
Good place to build a career.
"You have an opportunity to work with some very smart and driven people, it is an overall collaborative environment with great culture surrounding each position"
Very rude and unprofessional management.
"First day there supvervisor immediately was very rude, ignorant and very unprofessional."
"The atmosphere was noticeably tense when supvervisor was around, the other supvervisor there was very pleasant and professional."
The pay was good.
I cant say much about the benefits since i was only there for a few days before leaving.
This was the job i wanted but I refused to work in such a hostile environment.
Wouldn't mind going back if the management was different.
Good opportunities but pay is lacking.  
this bank is a great place to start a career but you may have to leave and come back to get paid fairly.
"While this bank like to promote from within, it's more to save on paying market value for the job then waiting to put the right person in the right position."
It was fun at times with all the activites.
the bank were open inside supermarkets.
So the bank was open 364 days a year.
the hardest part of the job was the hours.
Customer interaction was great.
"Activities with customers such as trivia contests, birthdays, give away days"
Decent.  
"this bank is a decent bank to work for this bank are growing more and this bank have lots of room for advancement , the way could be better but over all a good company that moving forward"
My this bank Operations Experience.
I worked third shift it was good for my schedule at the time.
"Very team oriented, always something fun to do."
My manager was great as a person and management skills.
the pay is good and overtime is always available to pick up.
must be consistent with your work and hit your marks
Laid back work environment with consistent busy days.  
this bank is a nice place to work.
As a teller you're able to relax a little in between customers while not having too much down time that things get boring.
Very agressive sale goals.
A very agressive sales centered culture.
"The bank however, does value and stresses a well balanced job work/life balance."
While the pay is average if you are able to meet your sales goals the incentive pay is very attractuve.
"The bank too, values good customer service inspite of The bank's agreesive sales goals."
this bank Loss Mitigation.
"The company is a great company, however in the department I was in, there was not much support in career development and job/life balance was non-existent."
Raises are non existant..
"Promotions are not available because the managers that are there, stay- the managers that are there've not moved on in 18 years, which means there is no way for you to move up because the managers that are there've not moved out."
Would come back.
Great experience and culture.
Provided strong training experience and provide the why behind everything.
Was equipped within months.
Customer experience being top priority.
Unattainable Goals.
Goals are set where at 100% production you still aren't able to hit goal.
Asked to where the hat of many other roles.
Virtually no support or training.
Tons of micro management.
Great Place to Work.  
this bank is a great place to work.
I feel like management actually cares about me.
management are open to and willing to help me accomplish my career goals.
"this bank is not overly stressful, but fast paced."
Fun place to work.
A typical day at this bank is sitting in front of your computer in your cubicle taking calls from an automated call queue.
The management is great and really cares for The management's employees.
The workplace culture is professional and about The management's business.
The hardest part of the job is learning how The management's systems work and learning what The management's products has to offer.
The most enjoyable part of the job is successfully helping a customer and making sure a customer are wiser when it comes to a customer's financial situations.
don't work here.
I would not recommend my worse enemy to work here.
Let me tell you if you work for a call center before and think this will be different because its a bank your wrong.
a bank ask for some high standards from there employee's but the walk in the door salary is a joke.
"You will slave out and maybe see $33,000 after your first 2 years if your lucky."
"a bank don't care about you as a employee just there customers, a bank grade your calls on 3 calls month with calls being being the best."
Now let me tell every set rep has there own way of scoring calls even know every set rep have a guide every set rep have to go by.
every set rep hear calls differently so good luck with that.
Also the adherence standard for my dept was 94% with half hour lunches.
so if you want a job with low pay short lunches and customer yelling at you because a bank is a horrible bank.
You are given 6 mins to resolve these issues and god forbid you need help..
smh don't work here
Literally the best job I have ever had!.
Pay is more than generous.
Benefits and discounts are amazing.
Management is laid back but stern as well.
Opportunities to grow and move up.
Tuition reimbursement
Be prepared for chaos.
The branch I was located in was a very busy branch.
Expect to be on your feet almost all day and deal with all sorts of customers.
The biggest problems I have faced within The branch I was located in is poor management and time management skills.
Many people have come and gone from The branch I was located in that we will be short staffed on many occasions in which we have to take on extra hours.
"Also, if there is a difference in anyone's cash drawer, everyone working that day have to stay until the mystery of the missing or extra cash has been resolved."
There were plenty of times we had fun and weren't too stressed but those times are rare.
The branch I was in was very busy so serious yet smiling faces had to always be present.
"Sales are very important there, if you're not meeting goals then you will be terminated before your year is up."
No security.
The first two months I had a great manager that always took care of a great manager that always took care of his employees and had a fair schedule for everybody's employees and had a fair schedule for everybody.
After that manager left the bank had at least 5 different managers for like a year.
"I got paid as a part time teller but, doing tasks of a teller supervisor."
Security is awful.
Regional management is unaware of a lot.
HR does is not help.
Nice people..
"I hadn't worked there in many years, but from personal experience and the type of position I held, I did enjoy the work and the people/managers I had around me."
Great Place To Work.
I really enjoy working for this bank.
this bank have always worked with my schedule as much as possible.
I am very Active outside of this bank and will need a Saturday off and this bank will accommodate when this bank can.
The stress not worth the money.
I was very eager to start at this bank.
this bank claimed to be a great place to work and cared about this bank's employees.
"Reality is my manager is rude, condescending and inexperienced."
The culture is people smile in your face and stab you in the back every chance people get.
Lack of integrity is rampant among employees and management.
Worst job experience I have ever had.
this bank is ok.  
"this bank is great, but the management in the regional I worked in was horrible."
Great people were being ley go for things that could have been coaching opportunities and kept employees that were committing acts that employees that were committing acts that they should have been fired over should have been fired over and keeping employees that were committing acts that they should have been fired over way too long.
okay.
Have been working here for a while now and they are not wiling to work with my hours to attend school because my branch is 'short staffed'.
It would be amazing if they would be a bit more flexible even if you are a full-time employee
this bank is a great place to work.  
"this bank is a great place to work, this bank has pretty good work life balance and the pay is pretty competitive for someone coming from the outside."
I do with this bank did more for those who are part-time.
My initial reception by current team members was not so great but My initial reception by current team members improved greatly cause management took action improve a. I enjoy working as a branch Associate because I like helping people and me and my customers connected pretty well.
"That was confirmed even when my new manger came, customers would declined being service at times in my absence per my new manger when I return from my short leave."
My initial reception by current team members was not so great but My initial reception by current team members improved greatly because management took action.
It was a good start in order to get my foot in the door.
"They don't allow employees to grow within the company unless you've been there for at least two years, no matter how well you exceed in the position you were currently in."
Always short staffed.
"Universal banker =teller work all day, yet expects you to make calls and achive goals."
"Always short staffed, mortgage department always short."
Terrible training yet expects for you to know policies and procedures.
Fun place to work.
"Very stressful, but has good advancement opportunities and the managers are truly their to help in that advancement."
Have great benefits and have great training to prepare you for the job you are training for
Productive and fun place.

work/life balance is good.
Salaries flat.
"I have been very fortunate to have a terrific work/life balance, due in part to my ability to work remotely."
"However, my salary hasn't budged since joining the company 6 years ago."
"I joined near the top of my salary grade, and unfortunately the scale has not moved during my time here."
"Bonuses have decreased annually while health care costs have risen, resulting in net pay decreases or flat salary annually."
this bank Work Day.
"Start the morning off by checking voicemails and emails and then pull reports to balance the day and tackle the most important jobs for the day, return all calls and verify loan information to customers."
Good pay and hours.
This was a great paying job with great hours.
I had an 10 minute commute on foot.
Conveniently located in the business center of Wilmington.
I would reccomend
Wonderful Job.
Working for this bank was an great opportunity it helped me learn the banking field and work with wonderful people that showed you different parts of the business.
Productive and relaxed work environment.
I enjoyed the work environment at this bank.

Development of compliance reporting..
Federal fdic compliance reporting as a result of new legislation.
"Oracle data warehouse development and external tools ssrs, etc."
Good stable workplace with employees that care and engaging
"No matter what, never go to HR about any issue."
The environment is difficult.
"this bank is not known for training, so you have to learn as you go."
"If you go to HR about any issue with management, be certain that you will be included in the next round of layoffs."
And there will always be a next round of layoffs.
Good Place To Work.
It was a good place to work.
Unfortunately I had to resign due to family issues.
The were not willing to accommodate a different shift in a timely manner for me to keep my employment there.
Living the Dream.
"Being employed by this bank was the best experience ever, and I often said, it was a dream job."
I enjoyed everything about it.
I did not want to retire.
Relaxed work environment.
If you value work/life balance this bank is a great place to work.
"Compensation levels are below industry norm, but Compensation levels overcompensate by providing a slow-paced, easy to balance workload."
Ok company.
"The compensation is lower compared to other companies, especially if you're being promoted within the company."
Lots of times people get promotions without any pay increase.
Horrible experience!.
"A typical day at work you sign in, start taking clients, balance and close at the end of the day."
I learned to have a lot of patience when dealing with rude and overbearing people.
I also learned that the team that works here is definitely flawed and I wished I had taken my learning experience at a different branch/bank.
"Management was not good at all, and careless."
"The culture of the workplace just not good either, the hardest part of the job, everything it was stressful, and most enjoyed getting to go home."
Great company to work for.
Great company to work for Provides work life balance and flexible hours.
Provides career growth and learning experience.

"Coordinate efforts with technology partners (MIS, CIM, Cyber Operations) and external agencies ISO event management and risk mitigation strategies."
Support Regional Alignment initiatives and manage Regional Presidents engagement for events.
"Manage assigned tools, application, and/or third party relationships"
came off as a good culture but a good culture was fake.  
this bank had a good face game but behinds the scene the management did not care about the management's employees as much as the management showed.
You were always under a microscope and the management monitored your phone calls and what you did on your computer.
"Good Job, poor management, underpaid per industry standard."
If you're looking for higher pay within banking then mine'd stray away from this bank.
mine know other people with the same job title as mine in other banks that make 10-20k more and that's when other people with the same job title as mine in other banks that make 10-20k more first started.
great bank.
Love the products so it was easy to sell.
Aggressive goals but achievable.
Bonus structure was not great for a smaller branch.
Plenty of training.
Nice atmosphere.
Remote employee.
I really enjoyed working for this bank.
this bank are good about keeping you up to date on industry training.
Managers were great.
Team support.
Not so good with internal training.
I would still be there had it not been for layoffs.
Good Leadership.  
this bank is a well run company with good leadership at the helm.
"Typical day is intense and fast paced with a more conservative culture, but people make Typical day enjoyable."
Good place to work.
Over all a good company to work for.
They could learn from employees coming from other banking institutions or work fields and do a better job in training products and company software applications.
"Some management were absolutely amazing and I was fortunate to have two excellent managers my last few months with this bank, however some managers were very lackluster and either did not care if some managers performed some managers's job well or played favorites and did not assist in the advancement of other employees within some managers's branch."
The benefits and paid time off were wonderful and I would recommend this bank to other for career opportunities.
A Good Place to Work.
Enjoyed working for this bank Mortgage.
There was opportunity for growth in this bank Mortgage.
I feel that this bank Mortgage where very diversified and the workplace culture.
I loved working for this bank.
Love working in the call center and now that the call center is virtual I believe it will increase the talent this bank attract.
Management was awesome and the opportunity to move up was always available.
I worked from home yet I was still stressed..
Might as well not ask questions to your manager because your manager won't get back to you with a response.
I would constantly message my manager when I was having issues and I was ignored all day.
When I got sick and missed a few days from work I would call in to let your manager know about my absence.
I later received a letter in the mail that your manager assumed I 'voluntarily resigned.'
"Mind you, I had 15 days to use..... for myself."
No Review.
"Daily activities included business banking, managing sales team, coaching, mentoring, compliance and service."
"At this bank this bank used technology to help customers save money, increase efficiency, and become more profitable."
Greatly supportive culture with flexible managers.  
this bank was extremely transparent with this bank's mission as well as this bank goal.
There were many opportunities to learn and grow within this bank.
Although it was monotonous at times there are various ways to make changes from within.
Had a great working enviornment.
The company environment was fun to work for.
Great activities withing the community like grow up great were performed.
We celebrated success and coached around opportunities
Productive work place.  
this bank is a wonderful company to work for.
this bank have the greatest working environment this bank i have ever worked for in my life.
"No day is the same, you never know what to expect , or what type of customer your going to get on the phone, sometimes human beings can rude especially when it comes to human beings's money."
Its very enjoyable making a customer day.
"such as helping a customer save money, make money, find money."
Great company.
Toxic coworkers..  this bank is a great company to work for.
"It's difficult to get a job there, because this bank expect greatness."
this bank offer great benefit options.
"My management team was great, however, one of my coworkers caused a toxic, very threatening work environment."
HR was unable to come to a resolution where I would feel safe coming to work everyday.
"So, I was forced to resign."
Terrible place to work.  
this bank has to of been the worst company that I had ever worked for.
When it comes to sales this bank are worse than Wells Fargo!
this bank will find other ways to push you out if you do not meet your monthly numbers.
If you like being treated like nothing more than a number that this bank is the place for you!
"When it comes to personal issues, no matter how urgent or serious personal issues is, if personal issues does not fit business needs you will not be excused."
Take caution when accepting a job within this bank.
ok place to work.
it pays the bills but it gets mundane and management( depending on who you get) can be lousy.
your taking class from people who know people who know they don't have n=money or know they did wrong all day don't have n=money or know people who know they don't have n=money or know they did wrong all day did wrong all day.
People are screaming and cursing a lot.
Anywhere but this bank Wealth Managent/Hawthorn.
Does not practice what this bank Wealth Managent/Hawthorn preaches.
Management by intimidation.
this bank Wealth Managent/Hawthorn senior leadership inexperienced and therefore created an environment where there was 100% turnover in one group.
"Despite protestations of 'culture', at the end of the day Hawthorn senior leadership are only interested in own career."
"Do not think that if you work for a woman, as a woman you will be treated fairly."
"Women leadership are the most in fear of other strong, smart women."
this bank.
"it was okay, I didn't really like how much we were micromanaged or underpaid for all of the work this bank expected us to do."
it was truly unfair considering we couldn't even go to the bathroom without permission.
this bank Wealth Management.
Good work culture and the people are nice.
A lot of politics to get to where you want to be due to the size of this bank Wealth Management.
Pay could be better.
Seems to value outside prospects more than internal employees
Great place to work with balance for life/work schedules.
There are great teams within the organization striving to succeed with the same goals: Provide the highest level of customer services across the organization and external customers.
Overall a great company to work for.
Amazing people and very flexible with home life and company life.
Positive work environment and helpful in achieving goals overall.
Would still work there if I didn't have to move away from the footprint.
Good place to work.  
this bank is a good place to work.
The office I work for are smaller than other offices in our network so career advancement is almost nil.
The opportunities here are driven by the employee and how much you want to grow.
For senior level positions though you would have to be open to relocating.
Overall very good experience.
Got opportunity to learn a lot at my branch under managers guidance.
Lot my procedures and policies reviewed which as a customer i didn't know.
Had fun learning.
Professional work environment.  
this bank/Mortgage Department is a great place to work.
There are great co-workers and plenty of team spirit.
Management creates a pleasant work environment.
Flexible Scheduling: Ideal for stay at home mom w/ school-aged children.
All employees start at a minimum of $15/hr.
Paid on-site training.
Opportunity to work from home.
Option to have a split shift.
Pays shift differential for shifts beginning after 11am.
"There is a transition phase where you are limited on time off, overtime, shift preferences, etc."
"After transition, 15 vacation days+ 1 personal /yr."
but is pro-rated first year depending on hire date.
Option to purchase additional vacation after 2 yrs.
Opportunity to earn up to $850 in performance based incentives monthly.
Plenty of opportunity for overtime.
Must meet minimum quality assurance metrics.
The job is very fast paced.
Managers/support is not always available immediately which directly affects your AHT.
Managers are required to do 'live listening' where Managers tap into your call without your knowledge to listen in and basically 'judge' or critique your call.
This is in addition to 3 quality evaluations.
Required to remain in your position for 1 yr before eligible to move to a new role/department.
Customers can be abusive.
Interactions with other departments can be stressful.
There is a LOT of misinformation between departments and roles.
Solid Job.
"Great pay, solid hours and a very understanding work environment (in regards to your coworkers) all mixes together to create a wonderfully progressive and diverse work space."
Culture.
I have a manger that is very helpful if there are any questions.
"Each day is usually very busy, there is always some work to be done."
The company makes changes often which must be paid attention to and can make it more difficult to do your job day to day.
Extremely Stressful.
I started in June 2017 in the Whitehall call center before everyone started working from home.
I had a really cool training class though.
"Boy, the management sure does know how to get the newbies hyped up for foolishness."
"The last day of training, people started to leave."
this bank is a stressful place to work indeed.
"From the time you log in to CATCH and turn on Spirit, the calls will be back-to-back with calls regarding disputes, transactions, etc."
this bank has some terrible fees was well.
"There's a saying in this bank regarding 'Overdraft Tuesdays' when customers would notice a positive balance in customers's accounts from Friday thru Monday, then Tuesday the funds are gone."
The customer is under the impression that The customer's balance wasn't negative over the weekend.
This is just one of many issues that this bank needs to update and fix.
Too many bogus expectations there as well.
"You can have a whole week of good calls, but the audit team will find your worst call and grade you on your worst call, so the audit team won't give you your deserved bonus."
The team leads have The team leads's teams working like busy-bees so that The team leads's 'manager's' numbers can look good.
One thing that I did like was the small cafe and the self-service store in the building.
"Besides the small cafe and the self-service store in the building, it was ratchet."
Great place to work other than the branch closing.
"Great place to work, great benefits, current branch will be closing in April of this year."
"I enjoy the work and the customers, on the job training could have been better."
Traveled to Columbus for training but was taught the very basics.
Quality Company - Employee Centered.
"The company has an excellent work-life balance, culture, benefits, and growth opportunities for The company's employees."
The working environment is goal oriented across the organization with a friendly/family collaborative touch to achieve The company's objectives.
Call center is not worth it.
I worked in Call center so this is probably a biased review.
Very stressful working conditions.
Incredibly fast paced with little wiggle room for scheduling.
not Bad While It Lasted.
"worked 8 years as a service partner then 5 as an actual employee, unfortunately I was displaced and had to start over again at 55 yrs old :( vacation amounts are good especially with the 10 annual bank holidays added in"
good.
acquires and deepens the branch customer base through a variety of proactive sales and service activities.
Manages the customer experience by identifying opportunities to improve the customer's financial wellbeing.
Collaborates with ecosystem partners to grow customer's share of wallet.
Positions this bank solutions to drive new revenue and customer loyalty.
Experience.
I currently work for the Equipment Finance sector of the company.
"We were acquired by this bank, April 2017."
My negative experience is purely with the original ECN Capital management team.
this bank has been a pleasure to work with and this bank truly appreciate this bank's employees.
I count it a blessing to be employed with this bank.
Great place.
Easy work place.
Great environment.
Easy to move up.
Great employees.
Cars about employees.
Clean environment.
Fast pace.
Great for opportunities.
Family oriented
Ok.
It was OK.
Not bad not great.
Could be better.
Pay is OK.
"Compensation was OK, but made it harder and harder."
Work life balance was good though.
That has been figured out.
No comment.
"A typical day at work: Review and respond to urgent emails, regarding loan application status, process etc."
Attend team meeting.
Work on loan files to obtain approvals for mid or final review.
Manager who respected you and your ideas.
"Flexible job hours, able to work from home."
"Ideas to streamline were taken seriously to add morale and increase productivity and when reviewed, were implemented."
Great CoWorkers.
"Unfortunately due to some issues at home, led to my dismissal, however, I enjoyed working for this bank and felt that I did very well there as an individual BSSR and a team player."
"Now that I have been able to get some issues at home under control, I would definitely work for this bank again"
not enough pay for what they have you do.
"depending on the manager you end up with, you may not have any work life balance."
the person who I had to deal with was not understanding of this and it created a lot of issues
No structure.
The brand ambassador role and outbound team need a lot of work in the Charlotte market.
The day to day consists of cold dropping into businesses like Dunkin Donuts and others to try and engage and gain acquisition.
Great opportunity for advancement.
I was a bssrt and greatly enjoyed most of my time with this bank.
I learned a lot about banking products thanks to this bank's awesome education program and there were many talks of advancement potential early in my career.
Good to start off in banking.. banking helped me get into the doors of banking but there's not much opportunities to advance.
Advancing and raises are based on favoritism unfortunately
but I learned a lot.
Great culture.  
"this bank is committed to clients, employees and community."
this bank is a place that nurtures continuous improvement and offers many opportunities for everyone.
Best Company.  
this bank is one of the best companies I have worked for.
this bank have the best management I have worked with in a long time.
My manager was very nice and if I had questions My manager had the answers.
No work life balance.
This company boasts a work life balance as one of This company most important factors.
"Well, maybe if you're at the top, otherwise I have never had less of a balance in my working career."
"There is no support from management and even if you beg for 'Required' training, often the branches are too busy to schedule you for 'Required' training."
I was there for 2 years unable to complete new hire required courses!
"This company might work for you, but This company was the worst financial institution I have ever worked for."
Way too much stress!
Bad store manager.
Store manager has no knowledge of how to run a team .
Which makes this work environment poor.
Store manager expects to highly of everyone making everyone feel like they are not capable of doing their job accurately.
this bank.
I know longer work for this bank.
"The last this bank that I worked in was Peters Township in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
I enjoyed my position and had no intention on leaving this bank.
Production/work environment.
The typical day starts with 2nd day maintenance.
We go through the previous day numbers and discuss our goals for the day.
"We review all the documents that come thru our system to open/close accounts, mainly DDA and CDs."
good place to work.
"Overall good place to work, advancement is questionable Lot of internall job postings."
"Always will to help, employees very friendly and always will to help when needed."
"Management is good, always there and will to assist when needed."
Have become very micromanaged recently.
"hardest part of the job is being micromanaged, conversations with customers have become very scripted and do not develop relationships as easy."
The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork provided from the team.
"the team work well together and help each other when needed, The hardest part of the job is being micromanaged,"
Great company but depends what location.
"Location is everything with this company, you could go into a great smooth branch or you could be in a scene from Alcatraz."
Unfortunately my management was very poor.
Regional manager didn't seem to care.
Regional manager didn't allow us to speak our mind with new ideas it was either Regional manager's way or the high way.
As I said this company is great.
Ok pay and good benefits.
They could work on not making the job so demanding so employees can spend time with employees's families during holidays.
But do research on the branch you work for before being hired.
Make sure your manager isn't putting up a front in your interview.
Ask a lot of questions.
Stressful place to work for a incompetent Head Teller especially the manager always in a incompetent Head Teller's favor regardless how many violations made.
Too stressful.
"The manager I worked for never listen to my side of the story, my side of the story's always the Head Teller side."
"Come to find out later, my Manager is close to the Head Teller treated the manager like a son."
Great company to work for.  
this bank was a great company.
this bank care about this bank's employees and provide a lot of awesome benefits.
The only reason I left was because I needed a full time position and there were no openings at the time of my employment.
A great company to take advantage of your skills without offering advancement in return.
The title says it all.
I am over skilled and overworked for no advancement opportunities without sacrificing my ethical standards.
"I was consistently used as a manager when convenient for the company without the requisite pay, and continually denied advancement due to honest discourse."
Good Place For Interns and Beginners.
I started my career at this bank as an intern.
this bank has a great internship program and a great trainee program.
The management team was engaging and encouraging.
Good starting job.  
this bank is a good place to work at if you've just graduated from college.
"this bank's a great starting point in building your communication, organization and time management skills."
Rewarding but Stressful.
"Currently travel on a daily basis, Average pay, Feel like the company is focused more about meeting goals than whats best for the customer."
My Job is not hard but stressful.
Constantly selling to customers.
Tracking goals daily to make sure you are on track and reporting to upper management constantly.
to much work.  
this bank Mortgage does not pay there employees enough for the amount of work.
If you get hired through a temp agency you make more through a temp agency than you do once you are hired on.
typical bank.
"typical banking environment, fast paced at times, highly regulated requires high level of attention, cross selling required, corporate casual to corporate culture"
Being an Administrative Assistant at this bank.
I really enjoyed working at this bank.
I liked the work atmosphere and the fact that this bank's new building is one of the greenest buildings.
this bank Management.
Management is poor.
Management tend to micro-manage.
Management rarely put any directions in writing and cast blame even when following orders.
Morale is low and the opportunity to move to other departments internally is poor.
"Management put all of the right policies on paper, but rarely follow through."
Active workplace.
Build loyalty friendly customer service.
Lot of learning skiing.
Very particular about their policies and procedures lot of options to the clients relations with client
Interesting Job-high stress.
I work mostly from home.
The culture in the office is minimal as it takes a while to get to know co-workers.
The role I am in is high stress and fast paced.
I got several promotions.
I enjoyed working at this bank because I did get promoted but I didn't enjoy working in a call center environment.
You are tied to the phone for 8 hours and have to account for time when you are not talking with customers.
"Like any other call center, management will beep on your phone to find out the reason you're not taking calls."
I didn't learn anything new because i've been in a call center environment for 30 years.
Nothing has changed.
The hardest part of the job is having people yell on the phone at you every day.
Okay work enviornment.
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
Makes it hard to trust company when company are not around
Not the place for capable technical people.
The only real qualification for management is seniority.
"Because the majority of them have limited skills, all good people, being managed by all good people, leave."
"So the people who stick around and get seniority, and are the next generation of management, are pretty lackluster."
Truly capable technical people are too valuable to be allowed to leave the legacy apps Truly capable technical people have patched repeatedly and are left in place.
"Unfortunately, Senior management's's preferred solution to any project is to add more management."
Senior management's do not take the time to really know what is going on and function as a sheltered clique unto Senior management's.
Good Wrok environment.
I believe this bank is a good company to work for.
"this bank offer many competitive benefits for this bank's employees, I worked at this bank for 24 years and was given many opportunities to advance my career thru job training opportunities."
this bank takes pride in this bank's employees in wanting their employees to do their employees's best.
good job bad pay.
good job however the pay is horrible which is way a lot of people quit.
the higher ups don't really care about the people in the branch.
we have to work a lot and I mean do things that are not in your job description.
you are overworked and underpaid.
the benefits are good and vacation is cool.
the workplace balance is really hard because a lot of people quit so the branch are always under-staffed.
I have worked here for 3 years and each year my manager got fired.
"Not the best place.... Spent 16 years at this bank....to be fair, aside form the last two, it was an enjoyable experience, but the last eighteen months became far too clique oriented an very cut throat, with management unwilling to assist most of the staff...."
the rules were arbitrary and many of the favored employees flaunted many of the favored employees's position
amazing place to get trained for sales development.
I really enjoyed working at this bank and learning sales techniques for different customers.
"The knowledge I learned here is applicable in nearly every other job I have had, the competitiveness was not as fun."
Not Bad But Not Great.
"the day to day work is very easy and most days are slow, not the most exciting thing but its a good start and pays you money but so hard to move up in the company and teller is not a career."
Ridiculous and a joke for a company.
a company fired me for 'not making enough sales' AS A TELLER.
I have worked for banks for years and have never heard of such a ridiculous expectation.
"I know the real reason a company fired me, which is a form of discrimination."
"a company do not appreciate a company's employees, a company demand more than what your job entails, and a company will work you to death."
Productive work place.
I loved working in the environment.
But it could sometimes be stressful.
Management didn't make things easy to work with them at times.
Salary is great but not enough for cost of living
Bad Place to work.
Poor management!!!
They hired people who is not knowledgeable about people who is not knowledgeable about their position's position.
"For example, I already left the company and wanted to roll over my 401k to my current employer, The HR didn't even know how, The HR transferred me to wrong department and still nobody knows the answer."
Turnover is super high!!!!
Please do not waste your time here!!!!
Good job.
I was at a consolidated branch and I went for a promotion
but I feel this bank lacks in management choosing or coaching due to the coverage areas being so big and only maintained by one person.
Decent company.
Decent company to work for.
Unfortunately with most large companies there is an epidemic of 'not my job' when asking for assistance from other departments.
Great Place Ron work for.
Great Work Environment !
Very Motivating !!
Great Career.
Very Inspirational Management Team.
Promotion is a Very Big Thing at this bank !!!
So Many Careers Advanceent Opportunities
this bank Overall is a great company..  
this bank is a great company to work for.
"Everyday you learn something new, if you need help in any situation there's always someone to help you."
Whether it's the help desk or co worker.
Either way you'll get an answer.
"Incentive pay out is pretty good too, if you do your job."
Nice Company to work for.
"Nice company, good people to work with most of the time."
Customers are great!
Enjoyed working for Customers.
Management has a bit to work on.
flexible schedules are more for the employees doing work and school not so much for every day working full time employee.
Used to be amazing.
I used to love and rave about coming to work at this bank.
But then the culture really started changing.
How people are treated is so inconsistent there it truly boggles the mind.
No open communication anywhere in the company.
Everything is so compartmentalized good luck finding out what you need to know if you did not know who to go to.
"Made it impossible to advance, .5-1% raises for year end."
Even if you get exceeds expectations its not going to be more than 1.5%.
"Good place to work, but banking is changing drastically."
"Branch manager was great, upper management was not supportive."
"In the past 8 years, 4 branches will have closed in the downriver area."
Banking is just changing drastically and I expect more to close in the future.
Not a bad bank..
just the way banking is now
customer focus.
"take inbound calls, case management, customer focus, problem resolution, case management, hardest part of the job is keeping up with cases that are assigned."
bank.
"I was very lucky having the people I worked with , the people I worked with taught me about banking since I had no knowledge about banking"
I aw very appreciative of the people I worked with hiring me.
this bank.
this bank is the greatest.
this bank are company that will train you and groom you into the position you seek.
So your eagerness to learn will determine how far you grow in this bank.
"this bank take pride in customer service, while also taking care of this bank's employees."
Okay job.
The day can be crazy if people don't do your job correctly.
You will get real irritated with your peers because your peers will have this lack of drive to help people.
your peers will often transfer customers to the wrong department and do not leave any notes.
Some managers are cool and some are just lazy and don't want to help.
this bank.
Process overload no work life balance.
"Management struggles with Sr. Management, lots of ideas and no plan to get there."
Peers were great and willing to share informaltion.
this bank is a great place to work..
I have worked for bank N Bank now this bank since 1988.
A professional environment.
I have spent most of my career and have worked in many departments to expand my knowledge to build my resume in the banking industry.
valuable.
valuable experience from years of working.
opportunities available.
training provided.
feedback given.
made good friends with customers.
clean environment.
Great place to work excellent employees and great customers.  
this bank was a great place to work and excellent employees were wonderful
i learned a lot from working there and would recommend this bank.
The pay was great and the care about your wellbeing.
You get paid time off if you had to go on leave for any medical reasons and the send you cards for your birthday.
this bank was a great place ti work only reason i left was medical reasons.
Flexible work arrangement.
Ability to work from home provides flexibility.
"When providing support to customers, the ability to support from any location makes sense and is beneficial to all involved."
A good starting point.
You can learn a lot by working for a large company; however something gets lost along the way when you are only a number.
Some big companies have mastered how to make you feel valued and others just see you as a number.
Unprofessional Environment.
"The training is severely lacking, the management at the branch I worked in was unable to perform the basic necessities of the job, due to having zero banking experience when hired."
It's ok.
This job really all depends on your personal preference.
You absolutely will just kind of blend in.
"You have coachings and things, but coachings and things're not as individual as coachings and things should be."
You're so tied to schedule adherence that it's pretty much impossible to actually get to know any of your coworkers
Yes.
Trying to get more informations about my employer at the same time i am still currently working there plc bank is great enviromnet place to work in
but i am trying to make sure this the right thing to talk
Lacking in career advancing opportunities.  
this bank's foundation in PA and the northeast leaves much to be desired in terms of career advancement anywhere else.
"Management can be hit or miss, depending on the department you're in."
"Not a bad place to work, but don't expect great pay,"
"Okay, but not a high profit place.. don't expect Christmas bonuses or competative rates compared to the industry."
They let you work from home and do good deeds and are a trustworthy bank.
"A steady job, but not the place young talent wants to stay."
No career advancement and bland wages.
"Raises capped at 10%, while a new hire can get a huge amount more."
"Better to switch and get a huge jump, and then even come back."
"All Investment. Seems to be all about Investments, even when your not licensed."
All staff members talking about investments.
Call nights specific to Investments.
"There is Business Banking , consumer banking, lending, but only call night for Investments."
Wonderful place to work.
We are a small group that handles the daily weekly and monthly problems that are branches these.
We can have something as small as the light go out to something as large as a robbery at one of our branches we are on the front lines ensuring that each branch has what each branch need to open and service our customers daily.
That puts us on the front line we have to be ready to send technicians out to correct Any issues in our branch May face.
Just Another Bank.
It has been almost 10 years since I worked for this bank and yet I still remember how unhappy I was there.
The management was incompetent and often times was mean.
In the end this bank was just another bank looking to make a profit off of this bank's members.
Stay away from this bank.
Best Overall Employer.
I have never been happier to go to work.
Everyone from the recruiter to the help desk is amazingly wonderful.
Everyone from the recruiter to the help desk really is like family.
I left due to medical reasons.
"If I could have stayed, I WOULD HAVE!!!"
Hardest Part of my job.
The hardest part of my job is not having the accurate training to do my job.
No training class only to rely on your peers who have 80 + in your peers who have 80 + in their pipeline's pipeline.
Great place.
I managed a business banking center with high small business clientele.
I was able to handle the pressure of sale goals mothly and quarterly.
a business banking center with high small business clientele was very transactional branch.
salary is low.
"Branches are closing, less opportunities for growing."
openoing and closing acct.
Loan application.
coaching new employees.
follow the audit procedure.
meet the quarterly goal
this bank.
"Overall good place, pay is not the best, benefits could def be better."
But time off is pretty good.
I would recommend them but they still could use work.
Friendly enviornment.
"The environment at this bank was friendly, though the management and how business was conducted left a lot of room for improvement."
"I've learned a lot since working for this bank, and have acquired skills I can use outside of working there."
"However, it there had been moments where this bank could have done better making me feel valued."
Ok place to work to get your foot in the door.
investments was a good position to learn the ropes of this bank and to get in the door to move around this bank.
I enjoyed my time while I was there and moved on.
Many changes.
Relationships built with clients and colleagues is the most enjoyable part of the job.
Difficult to change from sales to operations.
Too many recent changes that are not customer-focused
Competitive Job.. I liked the atmosphere.
The future support of working at this bank was very comfortable when your bosses are very understanding of your personal business as well as your bosses while agreeing in the workplace.
Thank you.
Very nice bosses..
"Bosses are very nice, you have to be a peoples person to work at this bank."
Banking has to be easy to understand for you to make sales.
Very important to know your products.
Flexible work environment.
Employees have the option to work from home or work in the office in an open workspace.
The pay is low and benefits are below average compared to other verticals.
"I truly enjoyed working at this bank, our department worked as a team.  "
this bank is very big on employee engagement.
A great place to work if you want to get recognized for your efforts.
I would recommend working for this bank.
"this bank is a family-friendly workplace, flex hours daycare and more."
"Great place to work for training, advancement and continuing education."
Extensive training before being exposed to your job.
"Excellent benefit, an flexible working schedule."
Management was there for you to help with your job requirements and to also help with advancement.
Had attainable goals.
full of sales.
"Enjoyable job, wonderful co-workers and love assisting customers meet customers's financial goals and teaching some to budget."
Hardest part of job is their financial goals are never good enough and expectations are very stressful.
Big Corporation; family feels.
I loved working for this bank.
this bank was a company that valued customer satisfaction as well as employee satisfaction.
Managers were amazing and the customers were the best.
this bank is an okay company to work for.
I need you to apply and work for yourself and see for yourself.
At first it was great to work here but after two years I do not see any room to grow!.
A way to get one's foot in the finance door.
Working for this bank played an instrumental role in the way I approached managing financial accounts and interacting with this bank's customer base.
Many of the clients weren't sure as to what was in Many of the clients's best interest and that is where I was able to leverage my expertise to ensure Many of the clients were taken care of.
Teller experience was great..
"Work days consist of answering phone calls, managing money and safe."
As well as satisfying customers needs and engaging with every customer who walks into this bank.
Na.
Working at this bank as just ok.
"My day consisted of new account reviews, coaching my direct reports, training employees, handling customer complaints, reviewing transactions for errors and mitigating risk."
The workplace culture was unfair and bias.
"One employee could get away with doing the exact same thing, while another was placed on corrective action for doing the exact same thing."
Horrible place to work.
"They expect you to walk around inside of Giant to gain customers as well as being a teller, and a financial adviser for a low salary."
The hours are long.
No security guards even though we handled cash.
30 minute breaks after being on your feet for 10 hours.
Upper management is only concerned about meeting sales goals.
Horrible place to work.
Great Advancement Opportunities.
Work hard and you will be rewarded with easy and quick advancement opportunities.
I've had great managers in many different departments that truly cared about your growth and development.
"As long as you express your interest in advancement, great managers in many different departments that truly cared about your growth and development will get you to where you want to go."
Great opportunities to learn different things.
This project taught me the basics of how to create a career opportunity in the Financial industry.
Great experience and learning opportunities with excellent management and team.
Decent Company to Work for.
Company is really good.
management is terrible.
Company was a great company to work for besides that.
Company was a good experience overall.
I like there workplace banking department the best
Great place to work but be on edge.
"The people you work with are great and the day to day activities keep you busy, but because it is so close with government work you have to make sure you are following all policies to the letter."
You can be let go on a moments notice because of this regardless of how good a worker you are.
It's a good place to work.
Management cares about you as a person and is willing to help you succeed.
There are lots of opportunities to advance your career and explore other careers within Management.
Loved this job!
My favorite..
"If you enjoy customer service, you will enjoy your job."
"Working at a bank, you have regular customer's you see periodically who trust you with regular customer's you see periodically who trust you with their finances's finances so you do create a bond with regular customer's you see periodically who trust you with their finances."
I worked at a pretty small branch so we quickly became like family and everyone was very supportive.
A great place to work to enter and/or advance your career in banking.  
this bank is a great place to advance your career in a number of fields.
"Having held numerous positions, I have had the opportunity to hone my sales, analytical, and management skills."
Great Place to work.
Enjoyed working there.
My specific department did not allow for any kind of advancement and the pay was not consistent with my 15+ years of experience.
working on the phones can be stressful.
The division of this bank I was previously employed is inconsistent w/ new information and not good at all when you're conversing with customer all day in a call center setting.
On how they do things especially in IRA Ops in particular is very meager which can be shameful with no defense when explaining policies and practices.
It was a great entry point for someone new to banking.
Initial training was well done and thorough.
You spent time training at job start then would weave work/training together as you start the first few months.
"The UBC position was just rolling out at the time, so there was a big push to get many employees (new/old) up to speed on being a teller/platform associate."
"Once on goal, you had to make a sales minimum to get paid your bonus."
Some were fortunate to work in busier branches than others.
They implemented a cold calling program about mid-way through my tenure to gain appointments with existing customers.
"In this type of setting, you were always trying to involve yourself with customers- so everybody was looking over their shoulder."
"Management was good and there was decent pressure to perform, not overwhelming."
Many of the best employees would leave for better positions with other banks.
"That was told to me at an early stage, and it came true for me as well."
I was grateful for the training and mentoring I received there.
the training and mentoring I received there definitely helped get my next job.
Communication and focus could be improved.
Each group ion this bank operates in a silo and there seems to be no will to change that.
"Upper management is very good, but middle management lacks vision and was not always transparent."
There is an extreme focus on resolving issues but not a focus on preventing small problems before small problems escalate.
Poor Management.
The environment at this bank did not foster teamwork or support by management.
Your personal success was viewed as a threat to management.
The pay was poor.
No advancement.
"No advancement outside of retail in my area,poor compensation for the hours worked,mandatory 6 day weeks two times a month as a manager."
Work life balance needs to be revamped.
Was in the IT Field Services Organization.
Worked with a 3rd party supplier that supplied services very similar to Bizbang.(company that I am interested in working for) The work included tracking and scheduling refresh of current inventory of PCs.
Most challenging part was locating PCs since PCs were often moved from employee to employee by users.
Most satisfying part of the role was working with the employees and helping the employees in the employees's day to day efforts.
Management was very competent
Not my cup of tea.
This job is a virtual customer care service.
It is hard to communicate via Skype.
Training is thorough but not thorough enough.
a lot of sitting.
Customers are hard to deal with and support is there but not easily accessible.
A lot of challenges in 6 months.
Management.
"Management would take sales comments and stereo type employees based on sales, without getting to know the work ethics of the employees gearing work to others to make employees appear not being able to meet goals."
N/a.  this bank is a great place to work for entry level positions.
"I have learned a great deal throughout my tenure there through coaching, development, and collaborative team efforts."
Upper management however is out of touch and does not seem to care for Upper management's employees much more than a number.
There's a great deal of micro management and conference calls.
The most enjoyable piece of this bank is servicing the clients of this bank.
Revolving Door of Financial Knowledge.
Their are so many different skills that one could obtain on both the teller side and the Sale and Service side of the banking world.
Tellers learn the importance of cash management.
Bankers learn the ins and out of products from DDA's to HELOC's.
Poor management and poor pay.
It's laughable that this bank tries to preach employee financial wellness but chooses to pay $35/k a year for a risk job and a degree.
Raises only occur if you meet all expectations and my raise was $400 added to my salary for the YEAR.
Not a livable wage.
My management team had both good and bad.
High turnover because of the poor management and poor communication.
"Management does not care about the people under Management., are defensive and take things personally."
One boss even specifically told us not to talk on our lunch break sitting at our desk because One boss was in a bad mood.
Management is constantly in meetings and never available.
My management team was great and there are a lot of great people.
People coming in from the outside have more opportunities than those within because People coming in from the outside don't have a 'meets some' rating on People coming in from the outside's reviews.
A lot of people get those meets some and can't get a raise or advance within because other departments won't interview with that on other departments's file.
Be ready for change.
Our department was constantly going they departmental changes and process changes.
Technology is a joke.
You need multiple programs to do your job and nothing works cohesively or just will not work at all sometimes.
this bank's IT is awful.
"Training was minimal, however, you have 'errors' that work against you and either screw you or those who are in Quality review."
The benefits are okay.
The best thing is the maternity leave.
"After one year, you can receive 12 weeks 100% paid and can also have a few weeks with parental leave which is 100% paid."
This was just from my specific department.
Typical Day.
Typical Day is inquiries by customers.
"You are a problem solver for many, and a familiar face for others."
"People trust you with People's hard earned money, therefore want to understand exactly what is happening (and can happen) to People's hard earned finances."
Ethics Issues.
"Toxic Masculinity encouraged, unprofessional environment."
"Toxic and highly exploitive culture in general, not a pleasant place to work."
"Most colleagues expressed feeling stressed, overworked and underpaid."
good.
Work was fine.
Management poor.
Too many supervisors and managers and Too many supervisors and managers wanted to have everything done a different way.
but it was overall
okay
Stressful!
Fast paced work environment.
The department you work in determines the culture of the work group.
Bathroom breaks are scheduled and time limited..
You can move to other work groups
Unfair.  
"this bank will only allow you to receive certain advancements that only this bank allow and barely any type of raise, but will higher someone else outside the company who could possibly be making 10k more than you just for coming from outside the company."
this bank do not help out employees for doing good in the company and advancing.
Quality company and clear vision.
Quality company with clear vision.
At every opportunity the vision for the company is shared from top to bottom and that allowed for an effective work environment
Great benefits.
"Great Benefits, Great team to work with."
Support you all throughout.
Celebrates associate achievements regularly.
Managers exudes positive attitude in the workplace.
Reviews employee standing.
Paid training.
Take the Good with the Bad.
Welcome to the Machine - Upper Executive Management is mostly Excellent and Willing to Talk 1:1 /
Deep Political Trenches and Fiefdoms in Local Banking Teams / Market President.
Watch who you align with or not with as the case may be.
Unethical expectations.
I would not recommend this bank because of the type of behaviors required by management.
"A banker job should focus on the client experience, not taking advantage of clients."
Stressful sales forced environment.
"typical work day was as any other financial institution, teller type environment, opening and/or closing of accounts, loans, customer service, healthy and clean work environment."
Excellent Company To Work For.
It was a Very Great Company to work for.
Very helpful & knowledge in growing & learning.
Support of a customer based structure to perform accurate and promptly performing financial transactions.
"• Process consumer and corporate transactions (deposit, payments, withdrawal and cash advance payment(s)."

Great Place to work with.
Shared a long standing union with this bank and worked remotely with some times flex work hours.
Allowed me to travel and have a great balanced life and will highly recommend this bank
Horrible turnover & management.
Management was weak and inconsistent.
After 33 years you would think that you would have some value with the company but that is not the case at all.
the company just don't care about the company's employees one bit.
Total contradiction of the company mission statement and what the company say the company's values are.
Employees are treated very different and very unfairly.
The benefits package is the only good thing that I can say good about the company.
Productive and fun working environment.
It was great working at this bank.
Recently this bank have adopted the Agile framework.
I have loved my days of work at this bank.
The team has been very supportive.
It was fun work environment.
Not good environment for minorities.
the environment is very segregated.
Leadership does not have a value system the support success.
"Poor moral , no integrity , no support , no training , more work given even when already at full capacity"
Beginning was great.
Everything was fine for the most part until the goals started to happen and wanted you to make high credit card goals and opening accounts as well but it was a good first job to get into banking.
Typical bank job with typical expectations.
"If you work with great people in a branch, this bank can be quite the pleasant place."
You need to be a people person as you will interact with dozens of customers every day.
Management above a branch manager can be extremely incompetent (hence my departure).
"Decent employer, with most of management being supportive.."
Most management is supportive.
"It truly depends on what area you are in, and the manager in that region."
"Work/life balance is off...but with technology, I think that's probably the norm everywhere."
The hardest part of the job was trying to incorporate teamwork.
"Operational and Sales team are very divisive, and almost seems to be encouraged to be that way."
this bank is a bad place to work.
My experience working for this bank was not the best.
The management is allowed to retaliate against the workers if the workers take disputes to upper management.
The management are falsely accused of transgressions that in turn get The management fired.
There is no viable coaching or training when something is done wrong.
Leaders were leaving the department based on how poorly other managers were acting.
All in all this bank was not a; good place to work.
busy.
very busy teams.
plenty of staying current with new standards.
lots of change across the board.
"very customer focused, the customer experience is a big priority."
productive and competitve.
Coworkers are great and all come together with having such a small staff.
Hours are great and accommodating and always room to advance career.
"Nothing to complain about with working for this bank, great company and would have stayed if I did not relocate"
workplace culture.
there was good days and bad days..
the bad out weighed the good.
In hard and challenging times the company was non supportive and understanding of timely demanding issues but expect for team members to be understanding.
The work required did not match the time it took to complete certain tasks as well as the compensation.
Great place to work..
I had incredible support from my manager and the branch offices.
this bank is a great place to work.
The hardest part of the job was the 100% commission compensation.
I left because I was recruited by Wells Fargo.
Loved the industry.
"With this job, as any customer service job, ther is an opportunity to build rapport and relationships with your customers."
This was something I loved with this job.
But if there is a harassment issue don't waste your time because HR with do nothing to help you.
I called three times over the course of two months and my problem was dismissed.
good place to work.
"very fast paced but great people to work with, cut throat hours and a stiff working hours but management is fair if you talk to them for wiggle room."
always room to advance
discipline and financial intergrity.
"good working place with more discipline , respect and values to ensure the financial well being of the customers and much more care for employees of the bank"
Good.
Great place to work fast pace customer focused.
Managers work with you if need assistance or have a emergency.
Overtime is great and you get time and a half.
Lack of decision makers..
They pay people a lot of money to run projects that are micro managed and there is too much input from people who have no knowledge of projects that are micro managed.
Second level management is usually afraid to finalize anything in fear of being second guessed.
Too many dollars are spent on salaries of people who won't make a decision---people are afraid to rock the boat.
Unable to give opinion.
Unable to give an adequate opinion at this time.
Recent market turmoil has made for unusual internal dynamics.
"Overall, a supportive environment with some ambiguity."
Needs Improvement.
"Based on some of the techniques within the business, the business need to focus on the structure of the staff and not too much on the customers, employees have a family also and would need a day off to take care of employees's personal issues."
At the time the nation's's largest home purchase mortgage lender..
At the time the nation's's largest home purchase mortgage lender.
I was able to work with some exceptional individuals in leadership here.
Some of the most important things about mentoring started with this company for me.
9-5 grind.
day to day is inbound calls.
Willing to get you your finra licenses but the day to day is monotonous and unfulfilling.
This is a position good for getting your licensees but is clearly not where you want to be for the rest of your days
teller.
It was a great place to work a good team a fun place and the customer were very nice and looked forward to seeing you on a regulars basis.
contest were great and management was excellent.
"Okay company, micro managed."
Job was eliminated - whatever.
But the company was okay.
the company micromanage everything in the branches which is okay for some but others may find difficulty with the servere lack of autonomy.
the company does care about customers and growth
but I'm not sure about the company lower level employers.
"Pay isn't great, hours aren't great, lunch isn't paid, branch stay open late and somehow I almost always ended up closing and getting home at 7pm (banker hours apparently)."
My branch never accepted snow emergencies as reason to be late despite multiple roads being closed and whitnessing a car slide off the road in front of me - literally call 911 and directed them to a car.
changes.
every job has changes however most of changes should include everyday workers ; should be better training better updates and not last minute updates.
"good place to work, definately not great.. good not bad place to work."
I recommend anyone interested in banking apply elsewhere first.
The policies and procedures alone are like reading an encyclopedia online and there is little to no support on understanding how backwards there operating systems are.
Hard to advance.
"Data driven, poor management decisions, lack of accountability."
"Very difficult to advance, depending on what tier you're hired on."
"If it isn't captured in a number, it's easily overlooked."
"Hard work and initiative will not be compensated, and recommendations, even from tenured staff (depending on level), will not, measurable, aid a competitive advantage."
Great Company.
Great company to work for.
They cared about their employees and took care of their employees.
A person could see a great career path that could be followed.
Would recommend.
excellant company.
"enjoyed working for this bank , different jobs daily not the same old routine, worked as a subcontractor for this bank and did maintenance work on the bank branches"
"great work environment, great management,.  "
"this bank is a great work environment, I enjoy going to work every day my manager makes it easy to excel at what I am doing and What to continue to grow and learn more only down side is that compensation could be better"
Predatory Capitalism.  
"this bank is not atypical within corporate America -- but this bank is certainly just as appalling and unethical as any other bank, this bank simply wields many jargon-laced smoke screens with which to shield this bank."
My manager barely acts like a human being.
"In fact, almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments) are human-like at all."
"Speaking to almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments, it's like there is not a single genuine bone in almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments's body, like the humanity has been slowly winnowed out of almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments's soul."
"I've sat in on meetings and calls where not a single direct, or useful, thing was said in two entire hours."
"this bank are attempting to turn this bank's employees into jargon-spewing monsters, too; utter automatons."
Positioning and capability statements are gross and no one - particularly not younger people - will ever be drawn in by an in-person commercial delivered by a robotic employee.
"With the heavy sales focus, we are highly incentivized to focus all of our attention to wealthy clients while ignoring the impoverished and those with genuine need."
The overdraft fees are predatory and atrocious - and this bank is content to continue to milk the elderly and physically disabled for fees that continue to make their financial life a source of stress and chaos.
I've been tempted to recommend customers like that to another bank.
"I genuinely hope that when younger people garner the reins of power from institutions like these, that the bloodsucking corporate leeches are thrown out."
"Also, voiceCX is terrible."
Please stop basing your employees confidence on the COMPLETELY arbitrary whims - more...
Fun place to work.
I loved my time at this bank.
I made a lot of great friends there that I am still in contact with even though I am four states away.
I wish I could go back but I don't think this bank will pay enough for my experience.
Great place to work.
Certain branches are easier to work at.
The branch I worked at had poor management.
Other branches I visited or assisted with were very laid back and fun work environments.
Fun place to work.
I enjoyed my time at this bank and made some lasting relationships with many people.
The environment for the most part was laid back and care free.
Management was very nice and the culture was inviting.
N/a.
My apologies
but I do not feel comfortable sharing this information in this forum.
Like any company it has its pros and cons
but I do not wish to share this information in this space.
It was my first banking job.
I Loved it here at this bank but good thing must come to an end.
"The pay rate for tellers was lower than any of the surrounding banks but i loved my job,"
Laid back environment.
I worked for this bank through the temp agency Aerotek.
I worked on a project for 3 months and was told I would have my contract extended.
a project was extended and rescinded due to lack of work.
Overwork for less pay..
They overwork you and do not pay what the job is worth.
And if you make a mistake it is not their fault.
Advancement is not so easy here.
They exploit their workers.
They will never fired you unless they have a good reason to not have to pay unemployment.
Very good when it came to working at home.
Not a bad place to work but training for new products not long enough.
Company would put you directly on the phone when you were not sure or comfortable with new product which would cause customers to become frustrated and angry.
Customers felt you did not know what you were talking about.
Great Caliber of professionals.
Duties included Branch and Client Visits along with New Prospecting Efforts in building book of business.
Great growth in Credit Underwritting and portfolio management.
Great Team Environment .
Hardest part of the Job was the juggle of multiple retail facilities.
Most enjoyable was the people I worked with.
Good place to work overall.
Upper management stressed sales too much to all positions.
This would create issues with customers and our own performance evaluations.
"Other than that, no complaints."
Nice People.
"Nice People, a decent amount of hard working individuals."
Company is open to finding a job that is of interest to you.
Salary growth is hard to achieve.
Decent benefits.
Seems fun at first....
"Unless you are in Pittsburgh, there's not much advancement."
"In Retail Bank, Retail Bank have taken away individuals''s style and techniques that make individuals' unique."
"We are all robots to Retail Bank, having to learn Retail Bank's way to sell and make calls."
It has become too much.
The sales pressure has now become too much and the fun is gone.
Too Cut throat.
"I witnessed my manager 'piggy back' off of my sales, we were required to record all of our employee referrals and after I made a referral they would approach the client and talk to the client again."
Going over the same financial products I did and then make a referral for themselves.
"Goal-oriented, consumer market."
"Provided materials, and education to further knowledge in our product and consumer needs/goals."
"Constant training on new products, marketing strategies."
Provided Benefits and
a great 401K
Delivery of documents.
Had to deliver bank documents to Philadelphia before a certain time I order to be paid accordingly.
"Once I arrived at the location , had to process and cross check for errors or concerns."
poor management and very competitive.
"Very competitive, you can get corrective action write ups a lot due to a lot of laws and regulations."
"Those who do not follow policy and procedures, spend a lot of time doing personal things are the ones that get promoted, not the ones that actually do what the ones that actually do what they are supposed to are supposed to."
Good step in the door job.
A great place to gain experience but wouldn't recommend the retail industry as a place for long term employment unless one desires to go into management then its for you.
Great place.
"This is a great place to work for the benefits and The pay, but if you're looking to advance it's almost impossible."
"The pay is great for what you do, but working to death (days days with Sundays off) can get stressful when you're missing out on family stuff."
productive.
typical work day is to process mortgage payment sort mail i learn how to process mortgage payment the management was there but not very helpful work culture was not very friendly
"fast paced, banking environment."
"Typical day at work consists of you helping clients with clients's banking needs, wasn't so bad the hardest part of the job is dealing with managements and irate customers"
"productive, positive.."
My manager was very nice.
But My manager's manager(the regional) wasn't.
"The atmosphere is pretty competitive among coworkers but as far as the company, you're expected to sell sell sell, even when there are no new customers."
"It's nonstop standing the entire time, which was unexpected since I picture platform bankers sitting behind a desk."
If you don't sell you're given constant coaching as if you're not performing well when in reality there are few chances to even sell.
Manager: The worst I ever had.. Manager in NJ my territory PA.
Without more than one hour a week Manager was telling me where I should go on appointments ect....Manager could not find Manager's way to my territory.
I should have been assigned to Scranton office.
Glad to be gone!!!
this bank.
Good Company that supports their works and offers an opportunity to have a good work life balance.
this bank offer lots of opportunity to advance and learn
Room for growth.  
this bank is definitely a company where there is room for growth.
There are a lot of opportunities in many different roles.
There are a lot of benefits for new employees coming on board from salary to PTO.
"However, for those who have been with this bank for 5, 10, 15 years those who have been with the company for 5, 10, 15 years feel that those who have been with the company for 5, 10, 15 years are being left behind and that this bank don't appreciate those who have been with the company for 5, 10, 15 years's loyalty as new employees are getting some of the same benefits new employees only received by doing new employees's time."
"Also, new employees are coming in with better pay."
Successful company with opportunities for employees to grow.  
this bank is a terrific company - performing well across the industry and affords this bank employees plenty of opportunities for career growth.
"this bank's mission is focused on the customer - for technology employees, The company's mission provides significant opportunities to grow as an employee while making banking better for the customer."
Productive and fast-paced.
"I truly enjoyed working at this bank, I would recommend anyone to apply for a job there."
this bank is a very stressed place but the managers are awesome especially all the branches I worked for.
"Great People, Culture, and Environment.  "
this bank is a great place to start a career.
The pay is a little lower than average but the experience and amount of skilled bankers and managers is worth it for early career starters.
Productive and active place that nurses growth and development.
During the time I spend at this bank I was able to learn and develop personal and professional growth that helped me achieved goal at work and personal.
Great company to work for.
Great place to work.
management is terrible.
management is a great place to work.
the hours are wonderful and the pay is good but the management they have running some of the branches are terrible.
they expect the bankers to do the bankers's job but are not a good role model in that aspect.
Excellent place to work.
Great management team.
Well inducted training crew.
Customer ervice is exceptional and team building instilled.
Would recommend this company for anyone wanting to go into the financial sector.
Customer service is difficult especially at branch level.  
"this bank is not very much fun to work for at the branch level, this position has become very sales orientated meaning that only numbers and calls matter."
Work life balance leaves much to be desired by working long hours with little pay.
"While coworkers are fun you must stay at this position in order to move up, but once your year is up, you can only move up one career level with usually no bonus."
this bank.
Overall a good place to work but very limited advancement for investments but lots of advancement for retail positions.
Very good continued education and never leave without an answer for clients
Poor leadership and a declining culture.
Change in leadership have resulted in a decline in culture.
"Managers are no longer empowered to make decisions, as this is all run from the top of the house."
"If the CEO doesn't think there are enough cars in the garage, no one can work from home nay more."
"Trying to act like a big bank, but still running a big bank like a local bank."
"If you are not in Pittsburgh, forget about it..."
nice place to work.
I would still be there if my position was not eliminated.
I got along great with my manager and the rest of the staff.
I learned how to be a better supervisor through the wonderful coaching of my manager.
Fast paced work environment.
Fast paced work environment with excellent benefits and great opportunity for advancement.
Enjoyed working for this company for the five years I was employed.
Excellent place to work.
Excellent place to work.
Great work life balance.
Fantastic organization with a lot of quality teams and management.
Highly recommend to anyone who applies there.
not applicable.  
this bank was ok.
the managers i worked for were very nice and most employees there were always willing to help you if needed.
just didn't like being on phones all day and every minute was crucial to be on phones.
Pushed to Sell!
Unrealistic Expectations.
My manager was very nice.
But My manager's manager(the regional) wasn't.
"The atmosphere is pretty competitive among coworkers but as far as the company, you're expected to sell sell sell, even when there are no new customers."
"It's nonstop standing the entire time, which was unexpected since I picture platform bankers sitting behind a desk."
If you don't sell you're given constant coaching as if you're not performing well when in reality there are few chances to even sell.
"Good people, but work life balance is a struggle.  "
"this bank is a good place to work; however, the work life balance is not so great."
Management constantly stresses completing the plan over ensuring the wellness of Management's employees.
this bank is a great company to start a career in the financial services field.
"However in my experience, this bank was not there when my manager abuse me in many ways, Even though i reported it this bank didn't do anything."
Management needs to me reviewed.
ok.
"it was ok for the most part , stressful and fast paced just about everyday , so you would have to enjoy that type of work ."
workplace culture was cool
New Challenges for Employees.
One of the best things about working at this bank is the opportunity for employees to take on new challenges.
"the opportunity for employees to take on new challenges engages employees to search out opportunities to help improve not only employees, but this bank as well."
personal banker.
If you are looking for a long career with the ability to grow within the same company than this bank is the place for you.
great benefits and great vacation time.
Worked with customers to meet customers's banking goals and needs .
Work the phones and greet customers with a friendly helping smile
Normal Workplace.
"At my branch, was a normal job, as in most banks there is pressure for sales, but my experience there was pleasant."
customers and coworkers are very friendly
Productive family oriented fun environment.
Very enjoyable company to work for.
Everyone got along and helped each other out.
Customer's loved our friendly service.
All of the employees got along and worked well together.
We loved problem solving and coming up with satisfactory resolutions to achieve high customer satisfaction.
We all kept up to date with the latest technologies and marketing and sales strategies to increase our profits.
Flexible work from home schedule..
Very relaxed yet sometimes fast paced environment.
Extremely nice people to work with.
I have not seen much interdepartmental movement so not sure about promoting from within.
Stressful and not a friendly enviorment.
Working condition is getting worst every year at this bank.
Too much pressure for making sales.
Expectations of job requirements is overwhelming in addition to my regular job responsibilites.
No overtime pay
"Good, stable company."
Company has good benefits and fair compensation.
"Departments tend to be under staffed, partly due to turnover."
"Overall work environment is good, and employees are helpful and collaborative."
Great Environment.
I really loved my position.
The only reason I left was I wanted to utilize my insurance licenses.
I loved the team I belonged to everyone always willing to help each other.
It was greart and then I knew it was time to leave..
I held three difference positions at this bank.
"Management, Wealth Management and Business Banking and loved this bank the most."
this bank was challenged and had a super boss.
Hm.
If you work there i will say everyone seems nice but they are not.
The moment they can they will start rumors or talk badly to you not only amongst themselves but to customers.
Great.
Great place to work.
But really banking is changing so much.
The pressure is way more than what The pressure use to be.
Other than that.
Great work life balance and great benefits.
Collaborative working environment with questionable leadership.  
this bank has a strong culture of inclusion and collaboration.
"However, the lack of process and reliance on relationships as a means of getting business done is ineffective post merger with bank N. Leadership direction is unclear and often plagued with lack of prioritization."
Collaborative bend has created a culture of decision (or more accurately indecision) by committee.
"Roles and responsibilities are not always clear, decision makers hard to identify."
"this bank is not nimble or fast-paced, slowed somewhat by regulatory requirements but otherwise by self-imposed bureaucracy."
"People are nice, willing to help - but slow to provide constructive feedback."
this bank rates high for me personally due to work-life balance with flexibility options to meet both professional and personal needs.
great place to work!.  
this bank always treated me fairly and let me explore my ideas.
this bank listened to my thought and tried this bank's best within this bank's guidelines to help the employees be successful.
Avoid this place.
So when I worked for this place in the begining it seemed ok but for your training this place send you far and the travel is a nightmare then policy and procedure seemed to change daily so forget what you learned cause it will change without notice which makes you look stupid helping the customers.
this place say this place want to do whats right for the client when the sales goals are pushed on the client so much that you are then forced to do whats not right for the client just to get the client off your back and to still have a job.
Turn over was so high and management has favorites that when management continuously do bad management keep letting it happen.
Don't expect a raise ever if your surveys aren't a perfect 5 and you must meet your ridiculous sales goals as well.
"No room to advance and running around for nothing and don't believe banker hours when you hear it, no such thing."
Long hours and then the BM would keep you after hours and also expect you to do events and reach out as well so no work life balance whatsoever.
I say keep looking and don't bother with this place just keep clear of this place.
I loved working for this bank.
I ended up in a different office where I didn't fit in as well.
But this bank is a wonderful place to work.
this bank offer lots of help and benefits.
Stagnant and demanding work place with constantly changing expectations.
Expectations and requirements frequently changing.
Staffing not conducive to a successful work environment.
"Do your job and do your job well, tomorrow new things will be added."
Frustrating environment where the customer is always right even when the customer scream at you and treat you poorly.
"Professional workplace environment, lacking in employee compensation."
"At this position i would handle anywhere from 35-55 loan applications, assigned directly to me."
I would reach out every few days to try to move anywhere from 35-55 loan applications forward towards closing.
"The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing metrics our bonuses and performance was based on, and the lack of communication from management."
"However, the most enjoyable part was the hours and the environment."
"It was a very relaxed, friendly, fun environment that let you work at your own pace."
"Direct managers were great, upper management was the issue within our department."
Great place to work.
"Great training program, benefits, and management team."
The pay could be better but that is really the only downfall.
Overall a really enjoyable place to work.
Good People Bad Management.
Overall there are a lot of good people at this bank.
Some of the higher up management doesn't have a grasp of what is actually going on.
"Some of the higher up management 'sell' Some of the higher up management's new products to higher management, and bring in outside workers from prior employment to push Some of the higher up management's new products along."
It's not allowing current employees a chance to learn and grow.
Can be fun when your co workers knows the meaning of teamwork.
"I've learned that working in a bank doesn't mean glamorous, customers can still be unpredictable, 50-50 ratio of rudeness."
Some customer can be really friendly.
Enteractive with co-workers and clients.
I enjoy banking for the company and assisting the customer.
I work as a teller and CSR on the floor.
When I asset the customers account and see that a product would benefit the customers I would explain how a product would benefit the customers as well as the company.
Great starting 9-5 job!.
I worked for this bank as a teller.
"I learned how to manage multiple tasks at once, answer phone calls, keep up with policy changes, work with others on tasks, customer service, etc."
I've learned a lot that can stat-stuff my resume for other career opportunities.
You also have multiple ways to earn extra money through incentives.
"However, being on the frontline and having to keep up with everything I just mentioned can be a real headache at times."
Multiple scenarios and tasks can be thrown at you all at once.
"The hardest thing for me was learning policy and procedure just for policy and procedure to change as soon as you get used to policy and procedure, then having to explain that to a customer."
"Overall, I loved my time there at this bank."
(This review is through the perspective of a young adult with no kids and real responsibilities.)
Freindly and competitive..
During my 16 years with this bank I felt respected for my years of experience and knowledge of the wealth management/trust business and enjoyed interacting with my co-workers on complex issues.
Although competitive due to sales goals the atmosphere was always friendly.
There were several department head changes during my time but fortunately several department head changes were all highly qualified individuals who knew not to micro-managers an already qualified team..
Great work enviroment.
Loved working for this company this company made it enjoyable to come to work people are very friendly and helpful.
this company's compensation made sense to the amount of work associated with the job role.
Bad management.
The management teams were very mean and rude to employees.
The management teams did not follow the hand book as The management teams were supposed to.
The management teams had more time to take pictures of employees outfits than to manage the pipelines for employees.
bank.
"A Tough spot to work for, management plays favorites, no room for advancement unless you are best friends with the manager."
Lots of work and not team work to get the job done.
Daily routine is set but no room for change.
"Lots of inexperienced or poor managers, politics & antiquated, slow technology & manual processes."
I've worked in several different areas and all have many inconsistent & cumbersome manual processes.
"And project-related decisions take too long due to the need for multiple levels of management input and approval & key stakeholders don't attend status meetings or read minutes, so r unfamiliar with all the issues & either take weeks to give a final decision or make a rushed decision not taking the necessary time to understand the complexity or consequences of key stakeholders's decisions."
PMs r too inexperienced to demand stakeholder attendance.
If you speak truth to power (e.g there's no way this work can be done properly in the time given)
"u will be shunned, criticized by your manager for being negative & not being a 'team player' & will be written up on your annual review."
Systemic dysfunction at its worst!
Managers love to play Monday night quarterback when something goes wrong never recognizing (or admitting) that Managers made the final go ahead decision.
"No support for fresh new ideas or alternative solutions, which is so typical of a large bureaucratic bank."
"After u start working there, even when u make or exceed expectations, annual increases don't keep up with cost of living."
"With the keyword being EXPECTATIONS; even when u improve year to year, they will slightly tweek their expectations so as to not give too many 'exceeds' or 'greatly exceeds' ratings as mgr."
"r limited to only a small % of employees that can be rated 'exceeds' or 'greatly exceeds', so only only their buddies & sycophants's buddies & sycophants get that rating."
It's a shame as NCB was such a better and more efficient place to work.
Great benefits.
Management culture differs between departments and divisions.
Big emphasis in TCOE to outsource all possible positions.
"After 22 years of service and survival of three acquisitions and one previous outsourcing of entire location in Kalamazoo, Michigan I needed to relocate to be close to my immediate family."
Great place to work.
This is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.
Management will back you as much as Management can and will help you grow in the company.
Good sense of work-life balance as well.
productive and infromative workoplace.
At this bank i was able to procure better knowledge and experience the business world.
I was also able to get more experience working with people from different backgrounds.
Horrible.  
this bank was a horrible place to work.
"The management was rude, condescending and there was minimal training before you were graded and chastised for your poor performance."
"The pay was far too low for the amount of responsibility employees were given ($11/hr but handling upwards of $300,000 in cash daily)."
"Employees are expected to sell products but never given any training on what this bank has to offer or how products work, yet you are expected to meet daily, monthly, and quarterly sales goals."
"Employees are paid commission, but you have to work for this bank for at least 6 months before commission is paid out, and commission is paid out a quarter behind, so you won't see any commission for nearly a year."
"this bank does regular and mandatory performance reviews and goal setting, but no options for advancement are ever given and no raises are ever given."
"You are given 15 PTO days and 6 separate sick days, but there are stringent guidelines on how PTO can be used and you can only take one full week off per year and can only take 2 long weekends (because you have to work Saturdays in banking)."
"It is absolutely unbearable, and I would NEVER work here again."
Compensation is Too Low.
"Unfortunately, this bank is known for not compensating well and this has been the case with me."
this bank has not been generous with either salary increases or bonuses for the past few years.
this bank mortage.  
this bank mortage was a stressful job and felt that you were just another number in the company.
management only cares about how many loans you close a month even though you did not have all of the customer's information needed
typical office job talking to people all day stuck in a cubicle.
Typical day at work consisted of coming in logging into your computer and taking phone calls all day.
i learned how to service credit and debit card accounts.
i didn't really like management being management fired me over a rumor that wasn't true.
hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers.
most enjoyable part was working on Sunday being it was really slow on Sunday.
Was much much better when it was Midland Loan Services.
I enjoyed working for Midland Loan Services.
"After Midland Loan Services took over, it became merely a mundane job."
"No longer bonuses for non-salary positions, very few raises, no day after Thanksgiving off, no vending machines on each floor."
"Workload basically doubled to the point you were afraid to take a lunch, let alone a vacation or even half a sick day or you would come back to a boat load of emails."
Pay was significantly lower compared to the competitors in the area.
this bank people you work with are nice.
It is hard to sell products when the traffic in the branches is slow and you see the same customers almost every day and this bank expects you to sell all the time to stressful
Stressful atmosphere.
"Good company , low pay , no ability to grow within ."
Poor management .
Some types of favoritism and discrimination as well .
High stress for sales only .
Good place to work.
"Answer calls from customers about customers's checking and savings, fees, atm's and deposits."
I learned the difference between a bank and a credit union Management was great the help you to become successful The culture is diversified The hardest part was the upset customer when there would not be anything that could be done to correct an issue.
The best part was being able to correct any issue
company is restructuring.
Growing pains and previous reputation for mortgage lending hinder personal growth.
there is good potential for future earnings providing the mortgage loan officer can be self sufficient.
this bank is going downhill.
"Technology is outdated, don't appreciate employees ."
this bank are always bragging about how much money this bank make but give employees no raise .. just a poor company over the years
productive.
Team atmosphere at the branches I worked in.
Overall positive experience and working environment.
Management is very willing to give employees opportunity to advance.
Great Place To Work..
this bank is one of the best places to work.
"this bank provides you with a great culture, good compensation, work life balance, and gives you a challenge."
I have enjoyed my time working for this bank and look forward to many more years to come.
Productive days.
"• Trained and assisted all new hires in all aspects of duties i.e. performance, attendance, and company policies."
• Prepared crew weekly schedules; opened and closed facility according to established procedures.
• Underwrite conforming and non-conforming loans for secondary market investors and maintained the portfolio loans.
•
Mentored and assessed trainees and give feed back to management coach
"Great company to work for.. Helping clients with clients's financial needs, referrals to other line of business partners ."
Coaching staff and being coached .Great carrier path.
Great training and training on every level .
"Great benefits , good salary."
Fun workplace.
Enjoyed Working there.
Learned some new skills.
Great place to learn new technology especially for fresh graduates.
Pretty relaxed and professional environment
Terrible for working parents or anyone else really.
"There are some things that are positive, like the maternity leave."
You can literally take off 4 months to have a baby.
"The problem is after you have a baby, any time you may need is dependent on your manager/department."
"There are not set rules or policies as far as how to take OA time, leaving early,vacation days, etc."
"So, if you have to leave an hour early to take that new baby to the doctor, you better dam well have OA time or you are S.O.L. And don't even think about having a disabled child, because when those last minute things pop up, as those last minute things absolutely will, you either need to take OT time or FMLA that you won't get paid for."
"Even if your department has over time on a weekly basis, there is no making up unless it's 'scheduled'."
Unless that is your are one of the special employees whose rules don't pertain to you; then you're ok.
"Also, they won't train you for you're position and if you make a mistake, they then want to write you up and threaten your job."
You can ask just about any employee at this bank and just about any employee at this bank will tell you the training is deplorable.
Throughout the entire company.
"Plus, don't think you'll be able to move around based on the merit of your work, work ethic, performance because it's all about who you know."
"If you don't know someone in a department, you more than likely won't even get a shot, especially if a department's a supervisor position."
"They have to interview people for legal reasons, but what you don't know is they already have someone in mind for a department, so they are just wasting your time."
I have a literally been turned down for a job the hiring manager - more...
Good place to work.
Everyone is always friendly and willing to coach you.
There is a huge push towards sales.
So that made me uncomfortable at times.
For I am not much of a pushy person.
Relaxed and collaborative workplace with gracious managers.
"This position was a relaxed, entry-level title."
Management was made up of a collection of managers that oversaw a collection of managers that oversaw their own team's own team.
My manager and my team were all very nice people that cared about work-life balance.
"this bank offered up to 3 weeks paid vacation, in addition to 6 occasional absences and one personal day that you could take throughout the year."
"The pay started at 12 an hour when I first came in, but changed to 15 an hour as this bank upped this bank's minimum wage."
"Overall, I saw that employees and managers were all very happy and content with what this bank had to offer."
"However, living in Pittsburgh is very stressful and expensive, so it's not for everyone."
"I would recommend this bank to anyone that likes a quiet, independent work environment."
Don't expect to get out of your chair very much while working This position.
The only big downside that I saw is that you have to really work hard in order to ever progress.
Managers don't want you to move up.
"I am sad to leave, but only did so that I could go part-time somewhere else and resume my education."
"Great place to work, new management, more meetings.  "
this bank has been a great place to work for the past 5 years.
"There have been many changes over the past 5 years which has resulted in more meetings, more processes and more stuff that takes us away from our clients."
this bank use to treat us like adults and now it is going towards constant monitoring and oversight.
"Great Place to Work, Very Corporate.  "
"this bank has excellent benefit options, a lot of resources to learn from and to ask questions to."
this bank have a pension plan and 401K (with a % match) and this bank had just bumped Minimum wage when I was leaving.
"A typical day in Document Imaging was busy but enjoyable, the team I worked with was full of nice and delightful people."
"The experience would probably change widely with different managers, of which there are many, but I like all of the managers that I met and worked with."
The only Negative was how corporate this bank could be.
Timed task reconciliation (you timed yourself and you had to calculate your production at the end of EVERY DAY) was stressful and could leave you feeling like you under-preformed on a day that you worked your butt off.
"Often in daily morning production reviews the sub-par numbers would be the only thing noticed, not the workload or the numbers in the green."
"Overall though, if you can get past the numbers, this bank was a great place to work."
"Relaxed atmosphere, not micro managed, excellent training and acknowledgements relating to exceptional job performance."
My supervisor is someone I would hope everyone had the chance to have as a boss.
"I have worked for 30 years and the last 5 years before I left, were the happiest I have ever been working for someone."
It's a call center so it's demanding.
I just feel there is no room to grow or improve even if you can move up in the company the company keep your pay at a lateral move.
What is the point in taking a position 2 paygrades higher if your pay remains the same.
best place I ever worked at.
"Excellent atmosphere with ability to grow and develop, challenging yet supportive."
Wealth of on line classes and courses to learn.
Well run organization.
Good benefits.
"Poor management, long working hours."
Some of the customers can very unfriendly.
"Stressful working environment, unpaid one hour lunch and you spend one hour each day working longer."
Good benefits
but that's about it.
Some weeks you are required to work 6 days a week.
Very low pay for this type of job.
Avoid this place.
Was lured here and found management to be extremely unprofessional and biased towards certain people.
this place is a sweat shop - burn 'em and churn 'em is what management do.
No room for advancement - had the carrot dangled with regards to the yearly bonus - never received the carrot dangled with regards to the yearly bonus.
this place borders on psychological torture.
Worked my hardest - total lack of direction within the technology area - don't get me wrong - there are some good people here - and some good people go through it as well.
management torture you with this 90 day probation period - this 90 day probation period's nothing more than a hazing.
management should be reported to the state.
Great Experience.
Learn multiple roles and duties and job exposure.
allow you to be places in leadership and recognition.
Focus on customer experiences and traditional banking within the communities.
"Good Company to work for, each day is a good day at this bank.."
"The team is great to work with, and The team always have things to keep you busy."
"Each day is an enjoyable day, I always enjoyed going to work for this bank."
Great upbeat people and management is terrific.
Don't work here.
You walk in every day not knowing if it's goig to be your last.
"The management sucks, and The management're not supportive of you."
This company is very discriminatory and will choose This company's favorites.
Decent place to work.
"Though it can sometimes be taxing or stressful to keep track of everything that you need to do, overall it was a decent place to work."
"Nights, weekends, and holidays off are a great perk."
"In addition to that, you get great benefits."
"Didn't really like calling customers to try to sell customers on meetings, to then try to sell customers on products or services."
The sales goals tended to make things somewhat stressful.
"Other than that, everything else was pretty great."
"Great benefits, hours, perks, and pay."
"lack of communication, bad management."
"lack of communication, bad management, over working hours with no outcome, great benefits."
empty promises about next positions.
lack of keeping employees
na.
I enjoyed working with the people at this company.
It has always been a pleasure to serve other and i was grateful to have the opportunity to be apart of a great team.
Great working teammates.
Company is focused on customers.
Company provides state of the art technology to assist Company's customers with its customers's banking.
Company does a great job making Company motto of ease confidence and achievement in assisting Company diverse business and personal client.
Good company making progress
Good people overall.
Good people make a good company.
Sometimes people get lost in the business.
Automation is taking over which concerns me about people.
The bank is very involved in communities The bank is currently present.
Good place to work.
Over all good place to work.
"Offers a good place to eat and lovely landscape, Good people, not too much chance to get to know anyone due to heavy call flow"
No real challenges - The Manager didn't pay attention to the team.
The Manager was an senior manager stuck in the management's ways.
Referred to the Administrative Assistant as 'Secretary'.
"At the risk of sounding sour, It was a great place to work unless you had to communicate with the boss."
There were RARELY EVER positive conversations.
Just putting out fires or helping the management of a jam because the management didn't want to take the time to do the management's job.
The culture was good except for the management...
Best part of the day was leaving.
The Manager also choose to ignore the enormous leadership development initiative set forth by our company leader.
'Strange' to say the least.
I believe the enormous leadership development initiative set forth by our company leader was looked upon as time not well spent so the enormous leadership development initiative set forth by our company leader DID NOT happen.
Managers only manage - Leaders only lead.
Position Review.  
this bank was an easy job nothing was hard.
this bank was not for me.
this bank was not what I expected.
this bank didn't challenge me.
I moved on to something that had more to offer to me and my family.
Poor Job Experience.
Unfair personnel.
Unfair Rules.
Favoritism among employees.
Unfair treatment among employees.
No one worked as a team.
A typical day was not challenging not a learning experience for Job Advancement.
There wasn't any enjoyable part of the job.
Good Vacation Time.
Have earned 4 weeks of vacation Need more leadership when it comes to helping employees advance in employees's career.
Everyone seems to be out for themselves in most departments.
It's hard to grow once you hit a certain level and there's no help or direction on moving forward.
this bank puts this bank's employees at high risk and has high turnover because of it..  
"this bank doesn't retain employees because of the staffing, training, and the no exceptions for mistakes."
"After this bank my termination me, I have had nothing but issues with my termination."
this bank put the wrong month and date which caused my health benefits to be put on hold until this bank corrected it as well as my pay and vacation pay.
I left this bank on September 19th and this bank had entered August 20th.
As of Tuesday October 10th I was supposed to have everything corrected and have my paper work overnighted didn't receive my paper work until October 12th after calling and asking where my paper work was.
"I have had to call HR, ERIC, HEALTH/ 401 K department at least once if not twice a week to follow up what HR, ERIC, HEALTH/ 401 K department were doing to fix this."
Not a place I would recommend or ever go back to work for and plan on pulling all my accounts and going to a different bank.
Too much micromanagement.
A typical day consists of assisting clients in the branch and by phone.
You are required to report to your manager your activities for the day before you leave.
teller.
Learned a lot because this was my first banking position.
Day went fast due to high traffic of customers.
Management most were good & helpful.
Liked all associates I worked with.
Project Coordinator working Remote.
Typical Day: Use Skype for most of the communications .
Assist Project Managers with Project Managers's assigned projects.
Work in Clarity to track all Project information.
Load Project Artifacts into Clarity.
Construct Project Plan in Workbench or MS Project.
Weekly Tasks:
"Cost Plans, Project Status Reports."
Quarterly Task: Quarterly Assertions.
"Meeting Agendas, Meeting Minutes for any project meeting."
Artifacts have gone through approval process.
Resource Management.
this bank had mentors for all new PMs and PCs.
That made approval process much easier and a much smoother transition that .
"People were great, but People abruptly ended the contract with the recruiting firm we were contracted through."
1 day notice.
"Not too concerned about People's contractors, which were the majority of People's project management team."
"Great people, felt under valued.."
Lots of hard work with little recognition.
Learned how to work more efficiently.
Management was mediocre.
Workplace culture was built around teamwork.
Good place to work through college.
HR made it impossible for a current this bank employee to get a better paying job upon graduation from college because the pay jump was too great.
"HR kept people from moving up, which increased people's turnover rates."
Great Company.
Lots of exposure to different roles.
I have learned how to do more out of branch work and sales.
The workplace culture is good they do care about your opinion however management tends to micromanage.
Hardest part of job is hitting incentive with lower salary.
Most enjoyable part of job is knowing that you could eventually transition into another role.
it was an ok place to work.
it was an ok place to work.
I worked on the first floor at firstside with no windows.
half hour lunch.
"two 15 minute breaks, the department I worked in closed."
the separation agreement was good.
Great Place.
I was employed with this bank for about 4 years and would have loved to continue to grow within this bank and advance but something happened and I was not able to.
However I recommend this bank as a great place to work.
I had a great time working for this bank as a BSSR..
"A typical work day at this bank starts at 8.15 am with a short meeting planning the day, and this bank are busy with an inflow of clients until five pm."
I learn a lot in public relation and client center services.
"I excelled in customer service, had a great management who listens to employees and has built a great team."
The most enjoyable part of the job clients being satisfied with my services.
Senior banker.
It depends on where you work but in retail banking it was the worst when they changed regaional management.
I would really think about if you like long hours and being over worked
Great Company.
Overall 9 out 10 rating.
Some policies need some work and that is why this employer only got a 9.
"Otherwise, great employer."
Would recommend this employer to anyone.
Great.
I have enjoyed working at this bank!
I get to work with all kinds of different people on a daily basis.
I enjoy being able to do more than just one thing at the job.
Flexible Work Environment.  
"this bank has policies that allow Work From Home for certain situations that benefit this bank, although in the last few months this seems to be somewhat changing."
"N/a. For personal reasons, I do not wish to review this job or company at this time."
Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
your understanding in this matter is sincerely appreciated.
Low Pay for same job at other banks.
"Great culture, decent work life balance, but overall pay compared to the job requirements is very low."
Difference in pay for others varies very drastically.
Review.
Global PMI moderated for a fifth consecutive month to Global PMI's lowest level in nearly two years.
"Although Global PMI remains above the neutral rate of 50, distinguishing economic growth and contraction, recent dollar strength and continued trade uncertainty could weigh on manufacturing."
good people.
I worked for 2 managers who were the best I have had.
Still friends with 2 managers who were the best I have had and would walk through fire for 2 managers who were the best I have had.
Upper management had no clue what Upper management were doing
not a fund workplace no longer a family atmosphere.  
this bank is a not a good place to bank nor is this bank a good place to be employed.
they changed there systems over for their loans and caused all kinds of complications with their customers.
the higher ups were not available lots of management took vacation at that time and had the Escalations and Loans teams work through the issue.
The Training for the new program was not adequate and no one knew what to do.
It took months to try and get out of the mess and there are still isses.
Good place to work.
Typical day at work consists of analyzing customers financial data to qualify customers for a loan modification or help with a short sale.
Management style is hands off and the workplace culture can be stressful at times but rewarding when you are able to help a customer retain a customer's home or close a short sale for a customer.
Quick pace.
I really did not like working here.
The branch I worked at was very busy because of the businesses in the area.
I typical come in and get my cash box.
I worked in the drive thru
so it would be at least 3 cars waiting for me.
I learned that I didn't like counting money as much as I thought I did.
My coworkers was really nice.
Most of My coworkers got along.
My manager was pretty cool as well but definitely was about business first.
Certyain locations were good.
"As a teller I handled basic transactions, withdrawals, deposits, recommended new accounts, and other products."
"I built many relationships with the clients, who would wait for me to deal with the clients, who would wait for me to deal with their transactions and accounts's transactions and accounts."
Great place.
"Don't intend on leaving unless, something much better is presented in front of me."
Very nice place to work.
"They do have expectations, but I was always one to have goals and to want to reach goals."
The bank does have changes from time to time and I believe The bank do keep up with the competitors.
If I do ever switch institutions in my career idk if I will ever close my account there.
Great company overall.
But you do need to understand The bank do have goals and expect you to serve the customers by meeting goals.
Worst place I have ever worked!!.
They were not flexible in an emergency.
Too many people there like to stir the pot and create a hostile environment.
I will never and would never recommend anyone to EVER work there.
They work you to death and pay you horribly.
Management was worthless as well.
"Any conversation you had privately with the manager, never stayed quite because the manager always went and talked about Any conversation you had privately with the manager with everyone else."
"Horrible, horrible, horrible plavce to work."
this bank.
Great company to work for.
The associates are very friendly and everyone works really well together.
"The benefits are great but the pay varies, it really depends on where you are located."
Some area's pay a lot less than others do.
great workplace friendly people.  
this bank was a great workplace wigth friendly people at the forefront of the company.
this bank back office functions were a little iffy at times but at the end of the day got the job done.
in my role with this bank this bank is very sales driven and not customer focused
Very difficult Job Inviroment.
Most people had hours where there tour stated in the am and ended after dark.
It is impossible to have a life outside of work with hours where there tour stated in the am and ended after dark.
The managers are Phony.
Great place to start.
"As a part-time employee, I was able to gain extensive knowledge of daily banking routines such as balancing drawers, analyzing accounts, and offering products and services to clients."
There is some stress involved when it comes to reaching individual goals but working as a team can help tremendously in enjoying the experience.
Competitive.
The staff was always involved in contests for bonuses or recognition.
The staff were very mean to each other and would purposely steal each other's accounts and sales.
Culture & Career Growth.
"In my opinion, more career growth opportunities are presented to employees in the home office of Pittsburgh."
The organization is so large that at times it is difficult to align resource needs to all the projects/programs that are approved for the year.
This creates confusion on priorities for The organization.
Culture change.
"Micromanagement and no work life balance, cultural shift to a more confrontational environment."
"Department morale is low, more verbal and written warnings are given."
Great atmosphere at the branch office.
Cannot elaborate on how it is to work now since it has been years since I left the company.
"However, benefits were competitive and management was always supportive."
this bank.
The hardest thing about working in a branch is that every branch entirely depends on every branch's manager.
"If the manager is out of sorts, the entire branch will be as well."
"I have worked in several branches with both good, attentive managers and also extremely poor, callas managers."
"Every workplace will have Every workplace's issues, and professionalism should always come first."
You should never see your manager and teller lead arguing over how to do lunches and yelling in front of customers threatening to quit the job.
"I have seen fantastic, helpful managers make sure that every employee knows how to do every employee's job and willingly answer any question every employee have."
I have seen managers treat employees like employees're stupid for asking a question.
The job culture and what this bank represents is a wonderful product and theme.
this bank truly do want to do good by the customer and expect this bank's employees to always do the right thing.
"As long as you've done your research into a branch, you can have an amazing work experience and enjoy coming to work everyday to see your friends/co-workers."
high turnover low pay.
"low pay for region but great job security, job turnover high which is why.. they love promoting from within but will never pay an internal pro,otion as much as an external hire."
My Experince.
Overall this bank is an great place to work.
I think that as an existing manager there should be better pay when you move up with in the company.
The offer job advancement however you are paid way less then someone coming in new to the company
Fair Workplace.
After spending 11 years at this bank I enjoyed my duties and my coworkers.
"I was grandfathered in to continue to participate in the pension plan, a 401k with matching was also offered."
"Health benefits were much better in the past, however still glad to have Health benefits."
Overall its a decent workplace.
There are several lines of business in banking and it takes time to find the right position to feel comfortable in and excel in with the right leadership and management backing you.
This is my opinion and experience only.
Going Nowhere Fast.
"I was excited about this bank when I 1st came, but quickly found out that this bank was a revolving door going to nowhere."
"The Comp plan sucks, the System sucks, and the chance to truly get paid on your hard work sucks."
"I'm sorry, if I'm selling refinances for $500,000 or better I should get more than $500."
It take forever for Loans to fund too.
"The underwriters are lazy, the management is spread too thin, and the moral is worse than the set of Michael Jacksons Thriller."
Heck at least the Zombies get to dance.
The trainers don't even know the answer to vital questions and do not truly prepare employees to be successful after employees leave training.
MLO's made less than the Mail Clerks!
Slap in the face and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time.
When I started it was 105 MLO's on the floor and when I left it was only 35.
"Don't waste your time, you'll just be looking for another place to work and that's sad because this bank're suppose to be a top 10 Bank."
It's like getting all dressed up with no place to go!
"Last thing, It's not fun seeing people scared that people are going to lose people's jobs."
I wish some of these CEO's's could spend time with some of these CEO's's employees and see why you need to treat your front line better.
Its a good job to have.  
this bank is a good place to work if you find yourself in a position where you need immediate employment.
There is no real structure in place for advancement however my direct supervisor was good at explaining how my direct supervisor could help me.
However if a mistake is made your manager is not the one you are to speak to and your manager have no desire to keep you once you make one mistake.
"Lead all branch business and activities, including the loan and balance sheet and sales performance."
"A typical day at work is supporting neighborhood businesses, helping people improve people's financial wealth and volunteering our time and expertise."
I ensure other team members achieve other team members's goals as we grow the business and leading by example.
To be well-organized with the ability to multi-task and prioritize.
The enjoyable part is when as a team we help customers reach customers's goals.
There are also many activities our team is involved in our neighborhood to make our jobs more fun and relaxing.
good friendly work culture.
"good friendly work culture, most jobs are rewarding and flexible."
Some of the entry level jobs are micro managed.
It has been difficult to transfer to a equal level job once laid off.
Great Workplace.
"Great culture, awesome benefits (3 weeks vacation starting, 4 weeks by year 5 of tenure, dads get 6 weeks paternity leave with the birth of a child), good stability."
this bank.
The people were easy to work with.
The hours were not my favorite.
Job was interesting.
Had to do a few steps rather then just sitting and doing one thing.
this bank is a great company..
I would definitely recommend this bank as a place of employment to my friends and family.
this bank provides the tools and resources to successfully perform the tasks given.
They don't know how to treat their employees.
Management is horrible.
Always short staffed and long hours.
They don't care about the employees expect for making sure that there is no line.
No work life balance at all.
Overall Experience.
"I have enjoyed being employed with this bank, I have been employed with this bank for 6 years, have a flexible schedule, great management, open door to reach all management levels."
this bank has been like home for me I have much respect for all of my co-workers and hope that I'm able to find another great home due to restructuring of this bank.
Professional fun opportunities.
Professional and ethically.
Management very helpful and professional.
Training is good at the class room and hand on.
Room to grow within the company.
Team work
Decent place to start.
Goals are unattainable and constantly changing.
"The company does a great job of paying top producers in incentive, but salaries are very low."
Management only cares about widgets not what the client actually needs.
Overall.
This is a good business with really good benefits and employee development.
Really helped development me as an employee.
I would recommend working here to a friend.
Great first grown up job.
This job has been great for me because This job has allowed me to experience working full time with a company that values a company that values their workers's workers.
I feel there is little advancement opportunity in the location that I reside in.
I also will be getting my bachelors degree in May of 2019 so I definitely looking for a pay increase.
"The customer's always right, even though you're explaining the policy."
They do not have their employee's backs.
The customer is always right.
"You can explain policy and procedure till you're blue in the face, have the customer ask to speak to a supervisor who explains the same thing you did, and you're in trouble because the customer wanted to hear the same thing you did from a supervisor."
One of the worst jobs I've ever had.
this bank Branch life is extremly stressful but the overall company is great.
There are no excuses for being short staffed
and you are asked to 'do what it takes' to get your job done.
"Between employees leave of absences, mandatory vacations, and turnover, I frequently work at night or early morning to just stay a float."
It's a repetitive but not constant problem.
Great Benefits.
I enjoy working for this bank.
I have gain a lot of knowledge in banking and process improvement.
this bank offer a lot of great benefits overall.
"However, more action need to be taken when handling advancement and job placement."
"Diverse, Engaging, Challenging."
"Unlike other banking institutions or just other companies period, this bank really strives to provide this bank's employees with work/life balance."
this bank also strives to give this bank's employees the opportunities to achieve its employees's best.
The teams that you are a part of for the most part really work well together and have great collaboration.
People from many diverse backgrounds allows you to grow as a professional and encourages you to think outside of the box.
Non friendly environment.
Good reports at the time to work with.
Come in work with bankers to complete loans.
Bankers were okay to work with.
Some managers were not friendly with even a good morning.
Culture was divided
ok company.
"somewhat ok bank to work for, very disorganized back office and support staff minimal opportunity for advancement if not nonexistent, rather confusing work place culture"
Average Company.
This company did not offer enough full time positions at the time I worked there.
I was unable to remain with This company on a part time basis.
I left This company to look for a full time job with benefits.
Fast-pace experience.
"Friendly atmosphere, teaching and learning was acquired."
The company cared about employees and treated employees well.
Not much for advancement but paid more.
Bad employee experience.
bad company to work for.
Poor Management.
Micro manage employees.
poor technology.
"too focused on numbers, and promote people without merit."
Very bad experience.
Fast paced work environment.
Business is high energy and expectations to succeed is very important in this field.
Looking for opportunities with every customer to build stronger relationship.
Micromanage.
Since the new management went in to place we are extremely micromanaged.
We see no longer a person but a number.
They act as if we see robots.
The moral of the team is at an all time low.
All in all a good place to start.
Not the best job in the world ( i work in the collections department) but benefits are great and pay is good.
Paid sick days (6 a year) and vacation (15 days plus one personally day.. which is basically the same thing).
Managers are hit or miss however I've worked under three in the collections department and three in the department have been wonderful and supportive..
the higher up the later of management the less management care about the little guy.
If you do your job well and put in your time you can move to other departments that are less stress and better pay.
All in all a great place to start in a corporate environment.
Management is sub par.  
this bank is struggling to meet satisfactory ratings with the OCC.
As a result the risk program is under constant revamping.
Changes occur so frequently it's nearly impossible to keep up.
Not enough staff to handle existing workloads.
Great Company to work for.
I love working for this bank its a great company to work for this bank's sales oriented but is not hard to do.
The management team i had was great and the training is all paid for.
The benefits are great the hours are set i cant say anything bad.
The only thing i will recommend is if you work in banking you have to move to other branches or other banks if you want to move up advancement within this bank is difficult.
Great place to work.  
this bank is a company that provides excellent benefits and work/life balance.
The compensation is fair and management really cares about management's employees.
I came into this bank with absolutely no experience with banking and this bank gave me all of the tools I needed to learn and excel at my position.
Productive.
Great place to work.
Typical day at work start at 8am and work hard until 6pm.
The only bad thing is they have yearly layoffs they call reduction of force.
I wish they would consider the work one does before just laying off good people.
Decent pay but absolutely awful management.
Upper management has no clue the day to day.
Often worked till 7pm or later despite branch closing at 5 because in branch manager couldn't finish Upper management's daily tasks.
Would be forced to take random conference calls during peak hours despite heavy traffic.
Turnover is so high other bankers have no clue how to perform other bankers's job and management is not willing to train.
Often asked to do unethical things.
Good workplace.
If you like data entry and sitting for prolonged periods then the job can be rewarding.
A typical day is logging in and begin to enter data into database.
Teller Lead.
I was hired for a lead teller role with no background experience in banking.
The branch was a large and very fast paced with little down time to solidify skills.
Management at The branch was very relaxed and didn' t always provide support.
Nice place to work.
Nice environment to work in.
Management cares about Management's employees and helps their employees overcome any issues and succeed.
Friendly co
#NAME?
Great job.
I enjoyed the many facets of this bank.
The relationships built there are for a lifetime.
The relationships built there encourage you to find the best job possible within this bank.
Workplace Culture.
The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and bank customers as friends.
There were challenging people in both areas but were definitely in the minority number wise.
Work life balance.
Great!
They have a great work life balance and want to improve you skillsnas you advance in newer positions.
this bank is a great place to work.
I am trying to get out of the financial industry.
"Fun place to work, flexible hours and in-depth training."
"Great place to work, flexible work schedule, tuition reimbursement, and incentive plan."
Offers in-depth training.
Would like to see increase in the tuition reimbursement amount.
Would be a better place to work if employees were compensated accordingly..  this bank is a great place to work and learn but the pay does not justify the work load.
There are hundreds of employees who leave hundreds of employees who leave their positions with this bank because opportunity elsewhere presents itself in form of same work load but significantly higher pay's positions with this bank because opportunity elsewhere presents opportunity elsewhere in form of same work load but significantly higher pay.
"Management is okay, culture is fine as long as the team meshes well together."
this bank career advancement not as good as I had hoped.  
this bank says in all of this bank's internal publications that this bank are trying to give control to the employee to advance the employee's careers.
"However at the this bank help desk, there is a very limited number of paths to advance your career."
"It is possible, but not easy and not very much support is provided by management."
decent work experience as long as you are accurate and quick.
The pay was better at Midland Loan Services is better than State .
"The first half of the first year was enjoyable but as the months go by, the expectations rise and there is less room for error."
There is some teaching but often the individual is left to figure out issues on the individual's own.
The department had a lot of procedures in place but sometimes it was hard to follow and there was some inconsistencies among different senior employees so it made it harder to know what to do in certain instances.
"Still, there were trainings and meetings to aid and address the the errors."
Best Employer.  
this bank was probably the best employer I worked for.
I worked in the Leadership College of the newly formed Corporate University.
I was afforded the opportunity to assist other this bank lines of business with employee development activities and there were always new challenges.
I would never have left this bank if it wasn't 911 and how the world changed that day.
I have a very good Supervisor and the team I worked with was very professional.
My time with this bank was okay.
My time with this bank was okay.
The environment was very stressful and the employees were not happy in the employees's positions which affected the moral.
The starting salary was very low and chances for advancement within the department were low.
Great people to work with.  
this bank is a good company to work for.
My co-workers were like family.
Used to have a lot of incentives for the employees but have currently discontinued a lot of incentives for the employees.
Very high expectations and low salary.
I thought I would be at this bank until I retire.
Not after I realized that I have hardly rec any raises in the last 4 years.
The job is very stressful and very high expectations.
Nice place to work.
During my tenure with this bank i enjoyed working with my branch teams.
"I performed in many capacities from teller, customer service, sales, cold calling via phone."
Not a fair place to work.
"In the Dallas contractor office in Plano, They cancelled the contract and fired over 20 PMs for something that 3 developers did on 3 developers's laptops, very unfair!"
summary.  
this bank is a great place to work.
"There are definitely heavy volume times, but the team always finds a way to get the work done."
I do feel as volumes increase that this bank should take a better look at staffing appropriately to handle the increases in volume and additional products being launched that also bring in additional volume to the Line of Business.
Not a fun place to work.
"Overall the views and what the company stands for is great, however I never experienced the company treating the company's own employees with a high level of respect, I say some even disrespect others."
workday.
"gave room for advancement , had daily meetings and updates, received monthly bonuses,had immediate access to a supervisor if needed."
the hardest part of the job like any other customer service is dealing with irate customers.has the freedom of working from home.
Great place to work.
I started there as a teller and got promoted to an onboarding manager within 11 months.
the only reason of relocating was they do not promote anyone before their 1 year of employment is completed.
Good.
"Teamwork, integrity and quality of life are just some of the values that our employees demonstrate every day, whether working with peers, listening to customers or volunteering in the community through the various programs and initiatives that our employees invests in."
Great place to work.
"Professionals, synergy and teamwork abounds here."
It's a great place to work ad would still be there if not for some unfortunate behavior of others.
Would go back in a second.
good work environment.
Everyone is willing to help out.
Good environment where I feel welcome and accepted.
Job is sometimes challenging but in a good way.
Room for growth is good.
great company.  
this bank is very employee driven this bank go above and beyond for this bank's employees.
this bank really care about family and this bank thrive for excellence.
I honestly love working for this bank.
The hardest part would definitely learning all the different procedures.
this bank Mortgage - Not a fit for me.  
"this bank Mortgage has great benefits; Health, dental, vision, HSA, 401k, vacation time and sick pay."
The mortgage industry can be very stressful.
"After an annual review, the raise was very minimal and less than 2% when meeting all expectations."
"Management lacks communication, micromanaging has significantly increased."
The required 'minimum' for the daily job is highly unobtainable.
"The amount of knowledge that is expected to perform the daily job, in addition to the stress of the nature of the position, blinded management, and the lack of compensation I feel is incredibly unfair."
"Morale is very low, I will admit, each person is accountable to uplift each person and others, but this bank Mortgage puts full responsibility of this on this bank Mortgage's employees, There are no, to maybe very tiny attempts from a 'corporation' to value a 'corporation''s employees."
poor work vs life balance.
I was told when I took this position that I would be required to work every other Saturday.
I was scheduled to work every Saturday for the duration of my employment.
The training was inconsistent.
The management was inconsistent.
management.  
this bank offers a good work/life balance.
The folks working at this bank are good people and try hard.
"Overall, not a bad place to work - pay is not overly competitve with rest of industry."
Low pay for the level of responsibility.
Low pay for the level of responsibility.
"You were second in charge after the branch manager, shouldn't the pay reflect that?"
the branch manager made the workplace very toxic.
Unfinished.
I worked in the corporate office downtown and as never able to get to the real point of me being hired.
"I had editing their level four policy with a mentor but wasn't able to interview managers to figure out procedures, write procedures, and then create a document that would be used to train people."
The powers that be saw that a red flag from an audit had been fixed and decided to let all the temp employees go.
"all the temp employees shouldn't have included me because the others were data entry, and yet I was let go, as well."
"We were placed in an old server room in the very center of the floor, so an old server room in the very center of the floor was closed off and freezing."
We were given leave to do whatever we wanted throughout the day as long as we got the immediate responsibilities done.
I didn't feel like a proper employee of the corporate office downtown because of being both isolated and almost alienated.
Summary.
A very nice group of professionals.
A very nice group of professionals. was not what I expected after being hired.
The support training that I needed was not available and took to long to materialize.
It's a numbers game..  
this bank will teach you about the 'conversation' but in reality it is a waste of time with constant double entry of information and debriefs that might as well not use a computer.
The incentives are a joke and upper management pretend to say upper management aren't this bank.
"However, the constant nick-picking and lobby engagement doesn't allow upper management to do upper management's job properly."
"For a conservative bank, a conservative bank act surprised when 70% of the credit card apps get declined and you punish your loyal clients and reward the ones that don't manage the ones that don't manage their funds properly's funds properly."
You don't get paid all that well and the retention is horrible.
This is why this bank offers 'bonuses' to try to keep you to stay on for just one more year as this bank suck your will to survive.
Marketing & tools lacking.
products don't meet all client segmentations and are not competitive in the market place.
client website offers a good tools for clients but like many firms client website is a widget environment.
Customer Service has very little flexibility.
You are clocked with everything you do on the computer.
Every second you're not 'auto in' Customer Service subtract that from your schedule adherence.
Realistically you have about 30 minutes to be out of adherence.
Customer Service really stress being in adherence.
Although you cant just end a call when you want so one long complicated call could easily put you out of adherence.
"You have two 15 minute breaks, but again a call can easily go all the way through two 15 minute breaks."
You then have to decide whether to take two 15 minute breaks and risk not being in adherence for the day.
So you could realistically be taking calls for 4 hours straight if you have a call that takes up your whole break.
"Got to go to the bathroom, thats going to be counted against your schedule adherence if you cant hold it until your lunch or regular break."
"Hardest part of the job is having talks with customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance, and customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance are only calling in because customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance don't understand why customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance have over a hundred dollars in Overdraft fees."
"We are supposed to educated customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance on how to prevent that from happening, and offer solutions for the future, but most of customer who have no money, no concept of personal finance just want to argue and want over a hundred dollars in Overdraft fees refunded."
"Best part, there is an employee appreciation week with games, food , and you get to interact with the upper management."
"Also, there are some really nice people and sweet old ladies that call in, but some really nice people and sweet old ladies that call ins not the majority of the calls unfortunately."
"Overall, its a great way to get your foot in the door to a great company, and can really help you get experience for your resume - more..."
What I Learned.
I learned I am not a salesperson.
This is a very competitive sales role and this bank expects you to wring referrals and account/investment openings from nowhere.
"Sell, sell, sell."
"Well I am more for protecting my customers' well-being so I tried to give my customers' good advice, not up-sell my customers' at every turn."
Therefore I could not get transferred/promoted and got the minimal raise at the start of the year.
'Okay' Position.
If you want good work/life balance do not work in a this bank in-store setting.
You will work weekends and holidays.
The bonus structure is based on credits and you get paid one percent for each of credits.
The salary is significantly lower than most banks and credit unions.
"Loved my co-workers, did not like certain manager."
I did not like certain manager and I got stuck working with certain manager for the last 3-4 months of my employment with certain manager.
This was after I was transferred from a branch that I loved without any say so from me.
Ability to work Remote.
Management is good.
Bonuses are not as easy to obtain as explained but if in the right situation Bonuses are obtainable.
I love being able to work from home and have the ability to start work at 9am.
No overtime is a blessing and a curse.
Great culture for a commercial bank environment.  
this bank is a great Bank to work for and this bank are much more people centric than other commercial banks.
Management takes a keen interest in your development and advancement.
Regional Leadership/ Work Culture.  
this bank has the potential to be a great place work.
"However, in the past 2 years there's been an extreme lack of leadership resulting in a very high level of turnover."
"I mastered many skills, and enjoyed the opportunity to grow client relationships, but the focus changed in to a more micro managed, sales oriented environment, where the branch manager's had little lead way to make judgment decisions in the best interest of the team, or clients."
The Region's Leaders don't care about the branch employee's.
"There were many days The Region's Leaders would enter the branch, and not speak to the staff."
"That in itself makes one feel unappreciated, and devalued."
"A main reason for the increase, and loss of many valued, tenor employees due to the ability to break down the regions morale."
The benefits are okay along with the chance to earn incentive bonus.
Communication which is one of this bank's core values was almost nonexistent.
"Sometime new hires aren't given a fair chance at proper training, and advancement depends on who you are, Overall this bank is a good company when led by consistent, strong, management."
Loyal employees create loyal client relationships.
Great place to work..  
this bank is an awesome place to work especially for someone fresh out of high school.
this bank pay well for a first time job and in general for that matter.
There is plenty of room for advancement and every manager I've had has pushed me to advance.
"The reason I don't want to work there is that it's not in my line of work, I'm just tired of doing something I didn't go to school to do."
not great.
a lot about this bank is ideal as far as pay and nice facility and decent work/life balance but pay and nice facility and decent work/life balance only goes so far.
management and up do not seem to care.
you are just a number.
and this bank has poor ethics when it comes to politics
A good place to work but needs some work.  
"this bank is a nice place to work, this bank is a large company however, if you are placed in a slower branch it may be difficult for you to advance in your career"
Team work.
Good knowledge of the various process happening in the bank environment.
Effective communication skills and inter-personal skills.
Efficiently handled various bank teller tasks and received best teller award for various bank teller tasks..
Handled various accounting transactions and reconciliation tasks.
Provided account status data whenever requires and handled phone enquiries.
Informed customers about various bank products
Enjoyable job but not the pay..
Below average pay structure in comparison to similar companies in the area.
The work/life balance will differ from one department to the next as well.
normal.
good company and good benefits .
great culture .
would recommend as employer .
good company to work for moms .
needs to increase moms's salaries .
normal
Financial Services Company.
"Great benefits, unreasonable goals, normal work week 40+ hours, outside business development required, management is aggressive and older, culture of coaching, job is very stressful"
Csr.
Very stressful work environment never feel settled in but if you happened to make to a year if youve done everything they demand you do get an opportunity to move to better hours or different departments
Great Company.
Great opportunity for advancement and room to grow within many different lines of businesses.
Work life balance is a priority in most departments.
Flexible work arrangements
Tremendous growth opportunity.
When I was hired I was able to be promoted within a year.
I was able to go to several different areas within the bank to grow my career.
the bank have a great process to follow to enable you to be promoted.
Very dependable.  
this bank had the usual opportunities of working for a large corporation.
Banks are very unstable with mergers and job security.
Banks required a high level of responsibility with very low salary compensation.
"Productive,pleasent people.  "
this bank overall is a nice place to work.
I do not enjoy the sales aspect of my position that seems to be overtaking the customer service quality .
"The work life balance is very unbalanced, as we are not allowed a full day off and work six days a week."
Great work envoirnment.
One of the best jobs I had ever had.
This company gives you everything you could ask for.
"Benefits, Work/Life, Competitive compensation."
The biggest issue This company have is with MANAGEMENT.
"One bad manager can taint an entire experience, and that tends to happen quite often in This company, as Managers are often quickly replaced and/or rotated."
"Consistent management is key to running a good business, and This company fails to find good managers."
Very bad work environment.
"Waiting on customer, processing all customer's banking needs."
Management was not flexible with you for your family life.
Working for a bank is a very strict work environment.
The sales goals are the hardest part of the job.
The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
Great Place.
In my top two favorite companies to work for.
This company had great benefits and was very reasonable with the amount of work.
I felt very fulfilled.
great place tp work.
"productive workplace , sales goal needs to be met quarterly."
"always need to refer products to patners , all great benefits 401k and eye and dental ."
they also have pension plan.
The bank is a great place to work with good hours and no overtime required.
Ok Place to work.
I learned a lot about the mortgage business and all the different forms associated with Mortgages.
"took all classes that was required, met my goals as required."
Loan Support Analyst I. Process payments to borrower's loans who are in Loss Mitigation.
Remove loans where signed documents or no payment have not been received.
this bank offers employees to volunteer to assist preschool students is fun and develops the community.
Salary.
Two major issues with this bank are; low salary and lack of career advancement.
"If you live in Pittsburgh, PA where the headquarters is located you have a better chance of advancing your career."
"However, if you are located in Philadelphia then this bank is only an experience mill to help you gain experience for other financial companies."
"Even if you have a bachelors degree and try to advance from an Analyst I to an Associate I or II your application will be denied, mainly due to this bank mainly wanting to hire from the outside and keep salaries low."
"Personally I like my current job, but my talents are being wasted and management are only interested in making management look good."
So if you are a newly graduated undergrad this bank is a good start to get your foot into the financial door and nothing more.
Great place to work.  
"this bank is a great place to work, the management team is wonderful and very helpful."
The most enjoyable part is your always happy coming into work.
Everyday you learn something new.
Love it.
Working here has allowed me to grow within my skill set and experience that I've gained within my career.
Taking the leap to come back to retail banking and excel has been amazing.
I do not want to leave
but I cannot find a job i like.
I enjoy working I used to love my job until my job turned to sales.
and all what we do is pushing products to the clients.
I wish I can find a back office job or accounting job there .
I feel bad to leave after 22 years
Do not concider working here.
This is a sales position.
"They are very competitive with their goals; however, the salary sucks."
They pay the least of all banks and they will negotiate.
Competetive if you are willing to put the work in.
As with all Organizations there is pros and cons.
"As long as you are dedicated and have the desire to be a Top Performer, the Company is pretty fair in recognizing and awarding your hard work."
As with most Branch Manager positions you are responsible for anything and everything.
the Company can be more mindful in providing faster and modern technologies to help balance all the spinning plates.
"FTE and Staffing allocations are slim which can be a challenge in meeting your Customer Service, Production and Coaching/Development of your Team."
"Also, the Branch Manger is the primarily the Business Banker as well so getting out and prospecting to execute on Business Calls can be tricky if you are not fully staffed and have the right Team in place."
Super fun place to work.
Being apart of Legends at this bank arts center was really fun.
I get to listen or watch a concert while working and making sure the guest had a good time.
"Even though, this bank arts center is an outdoor venue, I didn't mind."
The company is very diversified and hires people from different demographic groups..
Good place to work but lots of sales pressure and no clear career path for branch staff.
The tools for work are great and The company is big and solid.
Company overpromised and underdelivered.
Would not like to work there again.
Very little support.
"Loans took way to long to underwrite, process and fund."
Little help from management.
Worked long hours with little or no results after being top producer with Wells Fargo
fun workplace with amenities.
it was fun because you never knew when this bank would honor the company with little gifts or look at the monthly calendar and see when this bank would have bagel and banana day.
The hardest part was telling the customers that the customers's account had been overdrawn and fees were incurred.
"Good Company, Hire The Wrong People."
"Job was good,Coworkers were great Management was not good."
Expected us to reach goals with limited assistance and would get Coworkers blame for coming up short on bank goals even when we met our individual goals.
Good place to work.  
this bank really lives the work/life balance culture.
"this bank do provide an environment where you are in charge of you own destiny, however that may be due to the large workload/span of control being put on the management team so that the management team cannot allocate any time to this activity."
Compensation process is flawed.
Great place to work..
I enjoyed my time with this bank.
this bank is a well established bank where the company is not in a constant state of reorganization.
Roles are well defined and management has a clear direction and expectation.
Employees do not matter.
It was very frustrating working at this bank.
Anytime a customer got upset or had a disagreement it automatically became a customer's fault.
"I've been called out my name, cursed out, etc yet every time I was the one who got written up."
The manager was never available to help us nor did The manager ever stick up for The manager's employees.
I just had to accept that no one cares about me as an individual.
I'm just another employee that is replaceable.
After my new manager came in the job was no longer enjoyable.
I cried everyday before coming in just because it was a depressing atmosphere.
Very good place.
Amazing experiences working there.
Nice workplace.
Very educating experience.
Very good work life balance.
Allows you to move up according to your potential.
Good company to work for but management is terrible..  
this bank is a great place to work but it is hard to move upward in your field.
There are limited positions availble.
At my 2 year mark I asked for a raise or even insight on some job opportunities and I was turned down on both after being praised for all the great work I've done.
"It might be just my manager, but I definitely does not look good upon this bank."
stressful work life.
they didn't care about your future at this bank they just need to make sure you got your numbers by any means possible.
management always popped up unannounced and then my manager would always act like a completely different person.
Great for young adult.
No room for growth at all.
This job is good for someone that is young and still lives with someone that is young and still lives with their parents's parents.
While there it was fine.
I needed more.
Management seems to not wont you to better yourself
Customer Service.  
this bank is a great bank as a customer.
this bank offer all the things retail banking customers are looking for.
"As an employee, this bank were great to work for except for compensation."
We once had a meeting where the Regional VP was talking about different levels of accounts.
"the Regional VP said 'who doesn't have at least $2,000 direct deposits per month in their checking account' (helps avoid monthly fees) and everyone in the training meeting raised everyone in the training meeting's hand was like 'everyone in the training meeting don't even come close to $2,000/month in direct deposits'."
Showed how out of touch management was from this bank's customer facing employees.
"I believe this bank recently increased this bank's minimum wage, but when I was there, their minimum wage was below $10/hr."
"this bank offer tons of incentives for referrals, but you were lucky to get one or two per day due to the emergence of online banking and most people making the switch from traditional means."
Overall great company.
Just don't work here if you are the only source of income in your family (more of a supplemental income position or for mom's re-entering the workforce).
Not Good.
A lot of BS and little opportunity.
Management is a revolving door.
ive nothing more to say.
i am just trying to get get out of this screen.
how much more do i have to write?
Buen ambiente laboral.
"Recepecion de materia prima, realizacion de certificados, inspeccion de lineas de produccion, producto terminado, encargada del manejo de personal de las lineas de produccion, cumplimiento de bpm y 5´s , control de docuemtos del area de calidad, muestreo de producto terminado y superficies inertes y vivas para su analisis microbiologico, control y destruccion de this bank , entre otras actividades..."
bank teller.
typical bank teller position.
I would count cash and make deposits for clients.
I would also make product recommendations to make our clients money work better for our clients.
hours and the pay great.
hours were great along with the pay.
You got quarterly bonuses depending on your performance.
There is a lot of room for advancement.
There is always someone available for help.
Great Work Environment.
"I truly enjoyed the culture an work environment, teams worked cohesively together and supported one another."
Management recognized those who achieved and exceeded expectations.
Working with this bank.  
this bank is a company that believes in providing excellent service to the customer.
I have learned different processes and procedures that have helped me to grow within this bank.
The management staff is very supportive in your growth and are very knowledgeable.
At this bank The management staff believe that the environment should be pleasant and professional.
The hardest part of the job is understanding the needs of the customer and how your products relate to the customer.
The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team that has great communication skills and the day to day interactions with the people we are helping.
High pressure unrealistic expectations.  
this bank can be a great place to work depending on your manager.
Too many managers don't follow the guidelines set for Too many managers which results in a high pressure environment with unrealistic expectations.
If you are not in a sales role you will probably enjoy your job.
Good Work Environment.
The work environment at this bank is exceptional.
The manner in which the management team treats the employees is great and there is always someone willing to help.
this bank.
Great company to work for with great people!
Fantastic junior analyst training program with lots of opportunities to advance and move laterally within business units within this bank.
"Big spending in technology, but bad people management."
I found bad people management to be a closed set of people that hogged the limelight and never give credit to a closed set of people that hogged the limelight and never give credit to their teams's teams.
It looks like every person is for every person and intense power struggle is in play most of the time.
Lack of career advancement.
Lack of management & structure from Upper management; Sale driven.
go above and beyond for Sale driven.'s clients.
Poor internal communication.
Lack of empathy
Expectations of each individual employee are a little high.
"In some instances, little to no training is available."
Too many meetings; inconsistencies; communication is poor.
There is a lot of room for opportunity within the area that I work in.
I did not like the company culture.
I was in an accelerated college program that did not properly train the new employees.
an accelerated college program that did not properly train the new employees was rushed and not effectively facilitated.
an accelerated college program that did not properly train the new employees was a bad experience.
Customer Service.
"work and home balance, benefits were good, like the vacation perks and professional growth."
i would recommended this bank for someone who is starting banking for the first time.
Hard work low pay.
They have made it so one position covers them all.
One employee is responsible for all branch jobs.
"Being a teller, being a loan officer, being a customer service representative, being a notary, etc."
"There were very few days that I got more than a half hour lunch, would work at least 3 weekends a month but it was very offten over a month before I would get a weekend off."
They rely heavily on gallop surveys for performance reviews.
Where you may get one review a month but have hundreds or thousands of interactions the one review determines everything.
So if it was your one 'off' interaction a month that's all that matters.
The pay was not worth the job at all.
unstable working environment.
"salaries are not bad, the commission is not good and the working environment is not stable at all, always changes in management."
very sales and product pushy
Work/Life Balance.
"The company is great if you're interested in getting your foot through the door for banking; however, the commission is only if you get a certain threshold of accounts."
The in-store branches have almost no life/work balance and have made the goals more difficult for the branch.
My senior staff members have been with The company around 2 years and My senior staff members make around the same salary as I do when I've been there roughly 8 months.
The company's a great learning experience as well as a good place to start if you're interested in banking.
Excellent training.
"Excellent career training,coaching and overall culture."
"There is almost a zero error tolerance, so that would keep you on your toes(which to me was a positive)."
"However, we were always short staffed partly because the low pay always led to a high level of turnover."
always changing enviroment.
If you are looking for a long career with the ability to grow within the same company than this bank is the place for you.
great benefits and great vacation time.
just be aware there is a lot of turn over in the branch setting and you will get new coworkers often.
for sure a sales environment.
be prepared to meet certain behavior based goals.
Horrible culture.
"While working for this bank, those of us on that call were expected to be independent and not need those of us on that call's managers; then when those of us on that call had an issue with a client, those of us on that call were taken to task for not getting our managers involved."
"Prior to the integration between this bank and this bank , this bank was a fantastic place to be."
"Very collaborative, and our managers were very supportive."
"At the beginning, it was similar with this bank."
"Then they decided to do away with those of us on that call's division, hired in a manager whose job it was to get rid of those of us on that call."
a manager whose job it was to get rid of us made life and work difficult at best in what I believe was an effort to get those of those of us on that call a manager whose job it was to get rid of us didn't like to quit on those of us on that call's own.
"a manager whose job it was to get rid of us clearly played favorites, and a manager whose job it was to get rid of us made coming to work a stressful event."
"Then they called those of us on that call into a conference call and said those of those of us on that call on a conference call no longer had jobs; literally those of us on that call IMed with each other saying, 'whoa, wait, did those of us on that call just get fired??'"
"Later those of us on that call discovered if those of us on that call wanted those of us on that call's full severance, those of us on that call had to train those of us on that call's replacements from the outsourcing place."
those of us on that call had to finish those of us on that call's work plus take on more projects.
It was pure slave labor to get those of us on that call to leave without those of us on that call's severance.
I hope no one ever has to work for the two in charge again.
Worked There For Many Years.
Excellent company to advance your career.
IT management is very understanding.
Environment is at times stressful but these days all IT jobs have some stress.
Horrible.
"I was there for 16 years and when I left people who were just hired was making what I was making,."
"The lack of life balance, Why work mandatory every other weekend, Just plan selfish"
"Productive , great benefits."
I believe certain branches give u a better opportunity to advance as well as more fairness between employees.
I guess different branches have better business relationship rather than inappropriate relationship
Good place to work if you don't work for in-store.
"VERY, very heavy sales focus to the point that the customer's wellbeing is placed behind in-store's production quotas."
"If you work for the in-store, you have NO work/life balance as your hours Monday-Friday are 10:30AM-7:45PM, Saturday 10:30AM-6:45PM, and Sunday 10:30AM-3PM and you are only guaranteed off 3 holidays every year - New Year's Day, Christmas Day, and Thanksgiving Day."
The quality of people that in-store hires for in-store's in-store is low so customer retention is non-existent (unless in-store bribe you with yearly stay-on bonuses).
in-store often hire people who are unequipped to handle banking and end up leaving due to stress.
"If you are good at your job, in-store try to pigeon-hole you into staying in the in-store realm forever even if you were promised in-store as a stepping stone to moving on to traditional or universal banking."
"in-store will cheat you out of a promotion even if you were only 1,000 revenue credits short of goal and your colleagues aren't even hitting your colleagues's minimum set goals... but your colleagues still get paid similarly to you when the in-store pay scale is already below average."
in-store tell you to just keep busting your butt to make commission at the expense of giving you a better yearly salary.
Management often sucks.
Management'll look the blind eye to unethical practices as long as unethical practices meet sales goals.
The stress should never be that high.
In-store managers have no real power and therefore employees can manipulate managers easily as it's nearly impossible to fire someone even if they no call/no show.
"If you don't make your quota, it's like the whole world fell - more..."
Comfortable place to work.  
this bank is a great place to have and maintain a comfortable career.
"There are development opportunities, and other education benefits that make it nice for someone starting out in a technical space (model dev, analytics, automation), however if you are in these areas and what to work with new tech, this bank is not the place to be for long."
Work Relationship.
I think it is a good company I think it is the people in place who hurts other people and force other people to leave.
this bank bought out Flagstar and Flagstar made a lot of changes and elimated jobs.
Productive work place.
This is a work place where things get done but it can be very difficult at times depending on the task.
Although this is so things still get done by the end of the day.
Consistent training.
The value of consistent training on company systems was a valuable tool for job advancement.
Job advancement opportunities from within the company strengthened workplace culture.
Productive and energentic place to work.
"A typical day is working with the computer on all aspects of office work...letters, emails, typing, helping clients either in person or by phone."
Was replied on a lot to help maintain business was operating correctly as well as all equipment.
Position eliminated after 6.5 years without a warning?.
Management was not very forthcoming in eliminating my position.
No warnings at all for a person near retirement age?
Where is the compassion and consideration?
"Gave everything I had and begged for more work, only to be shown the door."
stupid bank.
god.
they still use mainframes.
and case insensitive passwords.
i guess if they didn't get money from the federal reserve this would be an unsustainable business model.
Great working environment.
I really liked working at this bank and worked there for 21 years.
I left for an increase in pay but the job did not work out.
I would go back to this bank if there is an opening for my qualifications.
Great job...but.
"I loved my job with this bank, but was unfortunately displaced after 27 years of employment after an acquisition."
this bank were not helpful at finding me a new opportunity within this bank.
"Wonderful, upbeat place to work..  "
this bank is a great place to grow.
There are many opportunities.
Management focuses on each person's growth on an individual basis.
this bank appreciates this bank employees.
"this bank defiantly makes sure this bank's employees are comfortable with it's employees's work, and also provides many tools for success, as well as live support."
Excellent place to work for.
Typical day was steady Friday's were fast paced.
Great management to work for.
Professional environment and enjoyed meeting and taking care of my clients.
The hardest part of the job not being able to help every customer.
Great hours for family.
Great Work environment.
"A typical day consists of reviewing credit, and reviewing income documents to insure I have everything I need to have the underwriter review and decision the application."
I was able to work at home two days a week and I like my team.
The hardest part of the job is making sure I look/verify as many deals to completion to maintain department goals because you can't control what documents you receive even if I clearly noted what I was looking for.
The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work independently and having the option to work at home.
Excellent place to work.
Great place to work!
Staff and employees are the best.
Family oriented company.
"Tuition reimbursement program, volunteerism is encouraged."
Plenty of opportunities to advance to other positions.
Every day you learn something new.  
this bank has treated me well for 5 years!
There are always opportunities to advance within this bank.
You do have to built for the job as you will deal with customers money.
"Some conversations will be difficult, some you have made a friend by the end of the call."
"this bank has paid well enough to take care of my bills even when I was part time, still in college."
The customer care center is a great place to work!
this bank Retail.  
this bank has mixed review.
From what I witnessed.
It depends on what area you work in to your happiness.
My side has been mostly retail.
I would not recommend retail.
I am not sure if the upper level management in our region even understands how a team environment works.
I believe a team environment are the main issue.
receiving monthly bonuses for required stats.
"A day in the life of this bank consisted of taking approximately 50-75 calls a day, also having a meeting once a day with your manager."
fasted paced work environment.
The hardest part of the job was servicing escalated calls.
"There were times when contests got you different incentives and also received bonuses for work well done, which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
They are fine.
Company was good.
Vacation time was good.
Very comparable to other banks in the area.
They seem to be a few steps behind when it comes to its competitors and the processes that they use.
Great to work for.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
Conservative bank.
Main issue being products are not very competitive.
Customers/clients can usually find better deals elsewhere.
"good company, unreasonable expectations."
"the benefits offered, flexibility, and direct supervisors are all great, very nice work environment and location."
Very career advancement focused.
The downside would be the expectations placed by upper management and the customers the customers themselves.
"In general people don't call a call center because everything is ok, and the expectation for volume of calls taken and time spent taking calls was absurd."
Learning experience in a variety of jobs.
Customer Service - meeting customer needs.
Variety of jobs: Experience.
Opportunity to grow in the company.
"Learning experience in finances, loans, checking and savings accounts, IRA's, Investments and more"
hard to get ahead.
"Personally, my job is very stressful in a fast paced environment with very little consistency in work load."
Department management is very good.
I have learned a lot about a number of bank products from my job.
The workplace culture is pretty good as far as teamwork is concerned but many people do not like the job my job.
Great company.
Love working for this bank..
Pay is lower end due to using Pittsburgh standards (I worked remotely) but great organization.
Working was simple..
Log on and do the work assigned..
Culture was solid... no micromanagement of any sort..
Great overall.
Challenging and rewarding.
Data entry clerk was a 3rd shift job which was the hardest part of the job.
I didn't mind the long sitting times and starring at the computer to key in the information.
Good place to work..  
this bank was very competitive in this bank's price on all products.
Focused on only a few industry types which limited this bank's revenue stream.
Works well as a team and immediate supervisor was always accessible.
"Great work-life balance, backwards IT department."
"Depending on your department, your experience may vary."
this bank has incredible work-life balance.
"I rarely work an hour over 40 hours per week, and work-from-home was pretty flexible."
Vacation policies are reasonable.
"However, this bank develops software as if software is 1990."
Do not go work for this bank if you want to work on anything cutting-edge.
Attempts to advise management and change the IT culture are ineffective -- no amount of APIFests is going to fix the fundamental problems with IT dinosaurs making enterprise-level decisions.
"Pay is mediocre, but somewhat compensated for by incredible work-life balance."
Excellent Place to wrk.
"Loved working here, was able to put my degree to work immediately and was offer a higher salary prior to graduation based solely on education."
healthy competitions between departments.
team building exercises knew how to make working there a fun friendly yet professional environment.
this bank.
Not my favorite place to work.
I did work part-time so I didn't get very many benefits.
In my training class I was the only part time person there.
Being part time I never had to be in charge of the ATM
Enjoy working with a diversity of clients.
"I enjoyed my 5 years with this bank and learned so much, much recommended."
"If I didn't moved home location, I would of continue with this bank."
Made a lot of friends and have a lot of references from all of the branch managers.
meh.
"management sucks, but management is what you make it with incentives."
"Flexible Hours, and often there are raises."
Do not mistake their push for sales goals for an interest in your career advancement
fun place to work.
"a typical work day, you get here open the branch everyone gets settled, we have a daily morning meeting, ive learned a lot that benefits you not only at this bank but else where"
Good place to work.
It is a good place to work and a place that you can retire from.
"It takes a while to get familiar with the culture, but once you do, the culture flows well."
The work life balance is a huge part of the culture.
overall great no advancement though.
overall great no advancement though.
"retail is great, but unless you live in corporate office area then there are no advancement opportunitites but retail and everyone is fighting for those"
Great place to work but has a tendency to establish guilt by association.
During my time there I was seemingly being groomed for a FT requisition.
"Once it was evident the 'Application Manager' determined I was aligned with a 'Troubled' employee, I was 'lumped' in with a 'Troubled' employee and after being extended 3 times on a contract, and told there was a requisition for which I was earmarked, ultimately my contract was ended due to 'budget'."
wonderful.
Very good company to work for in banking.
The company takes good care of the employees.
The company is great if you want to advance in The company.
"the management is very good, the training is good."
The company advocated for The company's employees and makes you feel good about working for the employees.
Review Summary.  
this bank Investments was a great place to work.
Great culture however this bank Investments were limited in how this bank Investments could help clients.
My managers were great but My managers's power to make decisions was very limited.
this bank Investments was definitely a place that gave you the tools to succeed if you wanted to put in the work.
easy room to grow.
"If you go in and do your job, they will easily move you up."
"They say you have to wait a year; but I moved up in 6 months, and again in another 6 months."
"Being at a call center can be stressful, especially inn a banking environment where people blame you for people not having money."
Just smile and wave until the end of your shift and until you can get in a role where you do not have to be in front of customers.
Ups and downs.
There is not much appreciation for customer service employees.
"If you are looking for a place where you can Advance, a place where you can Advance may not be the place if you do not have a schedule that accommodates your work and home life."
You will see people come in after you and get placed in your desired shift.
The way to survive at a place where you can Advance is to become friends with management and hang out and party.
On other hand there are lots of carry-ins and if you work full time you do get great benefits
caught up in DOJ ruling for licensing.
"I am currently updating my resume as I am now employed at Huntington Bank in Fishers, IN."
"Huntington Bank in Fishers, IN required Huntington Bank in Fishers, IN's licensed bankers to have series 65 to maintain their licensed bankers's jobs back in 2015, when I failed to pass series 65 I was out of a job."
"I worked at 5/3 for 24 months doing series 65 then Huntington Bank in Fishers, IN interpreted DOJ law differently in 2017 and stopped paying commission basically , so now at Huntington where I can still utilize my investment license in a banking arena."
Emotionally Exhausting.
If you get hired as a teller you will be very prepared to start your job.
The training is amazing and they do not let you on your own until you feel prepared.
Very high sales goals which are stressful.
Also management was AWFUL.
Felt like being in high school
and I was not in the cool kid crowd.
"Pay Is good, vacation days are nice too."
"If you like high stressful sales goals, and feeling belittled every day this is the job for you!"
Customer Service Rep was the worst job you could have at this bank..
Terrible Job.
Terrible hours.
Customers were always rude and disrespectful.
Half of the time this bank did something to screw the customer.
The other half were customers who just didn't know how to manage money and took money out on you because customers who just didn't know how to manage money and took it out on you because they were broke were broke.
Productive and fun place to work..
I worked for this bank for about two years.
this bank have many departments.
Its a fast pace working environment.
I loved my team my team pushed each other and my team were always encouraging to one another.
Good Company.
Great Company-
"Great Benefits, great vision."
The company is growing and is very well place in the market.
Enjoyed working for The company Big Bank with the Small Bank feel
Emphasis on work-life balance and career development..
Professional culture with emphasis on work-life balance.
Emphasis on career development and allowed for classroom training when applicable to job functions.
was a productive place to work for.
if it had not turned into just another sales position it would have continued to be a great place to work for.
we were not looking out for our clients best interest but pretending to act like we were
Nice place to work.
"It's a lovely place to work, I was fortunate with the regional manager I had at the time."
the regional manager I had at the time wanted growth and the regional manager I had at the time is so genuine.
The pressure was mild.
Productive and good place to work.  
this bank prides this bank on great customer service and strive to be the best.
this bank take customer privacy very seriously and are always looking for ways to improve.
A decent place to start out.  
"this bank is a good company, but the role I took Ithis reason overqualified for."
For this reason the work became incredibly monotonous.
"Great company, competitive pay, but I'm kicking myself for taking the role I did."
this bank.
I started when this bank was bank N. this bank had numerous management changes that caused a lot to leave this bank.
I on the other hand welcomed numerous management changes that caused a lot to leave the company and flourished.
Productive and interesting work.
Overall this bank is a good place to work.
this bank provide a career path and incentives to continue on a career path.
The work environment has open workstation are to foster collaborative working environment however can be distracting to some.
Faced paced mortgage company.
The company had a major growth pattern during my time working there.
My manager was wonderful and consistent during both daily work and company change.
relaxed.
typical night go in encode the checks into system process all checking coming in and out had you work fast and short hours that's how we receive bonus
not enjoyed working there.
Work environment was not very good.
"At times, the training was not sufficient and there was no flexibility for good work-life balance."
Some of my colleagues were not supportive at all an there was a lot of politics involved.
The work environment didn't allow me much flexibility and the exact job description was not made clear at the time of he interview.
this bank Teller.
"I loved this position, I was only part time so I didn't receive benefits or paid time off."
this bank Teller was very good to this bank Teller's employees.
All my supervisors were great.
this position taught me many skills.
Resume attached explains many skills in detail.
I had great employees that I worked with..
The colleagues that I was surrounded by helped me achieve success.
I was excited to come in to work everyday and work with my colleagues as well as with my clients that I built long lasting relationships with.
Awesome.
Great company to work for.
Been there for over 8 years and have learned a lot.
"Company really focuses on Company's employees and the customers, very happy to be a part of Company."
N/a. Typical day at work is reaching out to customers and/or waiting on customers from the lobby to make sure customers's financial needs are taken care of.
Management -- depends on the manager.
Hardest part of the job -- when you cannot solve a customers problem because a customers problem is beyond your control.
Most enjoyable -- when you do solve a customers issue or problem and customers continue to contact you for future needs
Work Opinion.
Working at this bank was a great experience.
"My typical day is to Assist may Manager , Loan Officers and Loan Officer Assistant."
"Printing/emailing reports ,appraisals daily."
Provide essential administrative support for Market Managers within this bank's Mortgage Origination division.
Primary point-of-contact for customer service and interdepartmental inquiries within the branch.
Assist senior management in all areas throughout the branch.
"Prepare and reconcile management reports, maintain employee time sheets and vacation schedules, and perform other administrative functions as needed."
"On-board new staff including but not limited to training on systems, interacting with IT and procuring sign-on, ordering marketing collateral."
Most enjoyable part of my job is creating a positive work environment .
My First Job.
This company really helped me learn about my field and what it is that I would be doing on a daily basis.
The management was really nice and pleasant to work for.
Work Environment.
"A typical work day, would be chatting with two customers at a time."
"Helping two customers with any and all questions about two customers's checking, savings, credit card and loan accounts."
"I have learned to show empathy, use active listening and reading, always be willing to help at any means."
"The workplace culture is relaxed, fast paced."
"The hardest part of the job, would be not to be able to assist customers with customers's needs."
The most enjoyable part would be the 'thank you for helping from the customers and co workers.
Branch Manager review.
Overall organization focused on doing whats right by the customer and key drivers are clients financial needs.
"Mostly all targets are revenue based, but some levels of leadership measure a tick mark."
Poor management as of lately.
"This job started out very well and promising, with my intention to move up and to different areas of the company."
"However, the past 6 months have shown inept management and an unwillingness to follow through on promised work from home time, due to extenuating personal circumstances."
"As I have no confidence in current management and feel incredibly disrespected in a variety of ways, I cannot recommend working here and am looking for another job."
High turn-around rate.
I noticed that no one rarely stays long at the this bank call center.
Out of 19 employees in my training class in June 2017
", only 2 people remain."
The employees in the this bank call center will all be working from home by the end of 2018.
wouldn't recommend.
wouldn't recommend.
schedule was too much.
hated the environment .
worked some days 12 hrs. had to wear uniform.
I would not recommend to anyone else.
poor work life balance
Ok.
"Like the company, loved my director!"
"Not a lot of room for advancement in Solutions Role, May end up doing multiple jobs with the lowest salary ranking."
environment.  
this bank was a great place.
The only thing that could have been better was the pay.
Overall the benefits were great.
It was the mortgage industry therefore job stability was a concern
this bank.
The instution had really great people.
management is what kept me for the time I was there.
great team work.
the pay was too little.
I would not go back unless they increased the pay
Good people to work with.
Not a bad place.
Good hard working people.
"Enjoyed working multiple partners, both internal and external."
Provided quality customer service in the business banking industry.
Enjoyed working there..
I enjoyed working at this bank.
"Fast pace very busy, Time goes by face during peak time."
Hard to move around in company.

"Additionally, my team streamlined identity management processes in the whole organization."
Good place.
Great place to work i recommend it to anyone who wants to work good vacation time and flexibility.
Awsome place to be.
One hundred thumbs up.
Never had any issues
Great atmosphere.
Great atmosphere to work.
The department was a fun place.
The department was busy/stressful at times but The department didn't get too overwhelming.
"If you like variety, you'll like variety here."
Micromanaged.
"Loved the job besides a few aspects, good for someone who can sit all day."
Great opportunities to move forward.
Must be able to meet all goals and standards.
Beware!.
DON'T DO IT!!!
The main reason I took this job was because this job was a work from home position.
But this job's AWFUL!
Their turnover rate is ridiculously high & I see why!
The training is so poor The training's not even funny.
You're basically in a room with a 'trainer' who sits on a 'trainer' who sits on her phone all day's phone all day.
You just do web based learning & tutorials to cover this bank in the case that you completely screw up an account.
That way they can say well you as the employee were given the correct tools to avoid this from happening.
The pay is TERRIBLE!
They give you a 10% differential during training & once you go home a 10% differential's a 12%...which believe me isn't worth the stress this job brings on.
"You have to endure being tethered to a phone all day like a dog on a leash taking back to back to back calls, expect to take at least 70 calls a day."
The calls come in so quick you can't even take a sip of water!
"You have to deal with people wanting to check people's balance, wonder where people's checks are, yell at you because people overdrafted people's account & there's nothing you can do to help people."
"There's no particular way on how to handle a call, it's all up to your discretion which I think is terrible."
A customer can get three different answers from three different people.
"There's not even consistency with the training, it's all based on what mentor you work with & how you will be told to perform your job."
"One consistency is don't hang up on customers or use foul language, other than that- figure it out!"
Their point of reference once you go home is to utilize the intranet or reach out to peer support via a telephone - more...
Great place to work.
The company gives you tools to succeed.
The company promote from within.
"The company offer great benefits, especially to new parents."
Great training.
A lot of opportunity for growth.
Was hired for a different position than i was placed in.
I was hired for one position and after being hired I was placed in a different position.
I was hired under false pretenses and my rate of pay was not what I was told my rate of pay was going to be either.
On top of that I was put off work for a couple days by a doctor due to injury and was informed that I would either be at work or be fired.
Doctor note or not.
I would not recommend the department I was in..  this bank is not a company I would recommend anyone to apply to in the Loss Mitigation department.
Management did not have the tools to effectively manage this bank.
So so.
Lack of structure was a large drawback.
Managers did not know how to lead nor Managers's own roles and responsibilities.
It was a relief to leave the organization.
Fun and great atmosphere..
I loved working for this bank the staff and management we all great people and fun to work with.
Great benefits and very family oriented.
I have nothing bad to say.
Great atmosphere.
Overall best place I've ever worked at.
none.
Its a great starting job for banker but i feel that banker can be more involved in the development of there employees and pay is not great at all banker pay the least from all banks
Great way to connect with people.
Working in a branch is wonderful if you enjoy meeting new people and helping others.
Especially if you work at a busy branch.
Branch employees tend to be the least paid and work the hardest.
That needs to change.
fun work place.
i enjoyed doing my job as a servant leader working as a scrum master.
i had the opportunity meeting and working with different individuals.
working as a scrum master you learn to use different soft wear.
Great place to work and develope.
Great place to work structured .
good people .
helpful .
great benefits.
pays extremely well .
trainers hands on.
I loved everything about this job just wish I could have had different hours instead of 1pm to 10pm every day.
None.
Worked there a long time ago.
Processed banking transactions.
The people were nice and I has no issues.
Left because it was a part time job.
Wanted more hours
No advancement.  
"this bank does not like to promote from within, this bank would rather hire from the outside and lay off the current employees."
this bank is not a career type of bank.
Job description not upheld.
I was told that I would be on the banker side of the Job 80% of the time and a teller 20% of the time.
In 6 months I worked on the banking side only 5 days.
The culture changes depending on department.  
"this bank looks out for management and this bank, I made several reports of retaliation on my manager with evidence, and nothing was done."
In my 5 years there I had two managers that were reported to HR by multiple members of the team multiple times and nothing was done.
I've also had amazing managers who looked out for amazing managers who looked out for their teams's teams.
"It all depends on where you are, But in general this bank seems to be a bit of a boys club."
Perosnal banker.
Good work environment - fair management practices and sales goals.
I would go back to this bank if a position was available which matched my skills.
Good company culture
Banking.
Worked with customers to meet customers's banking goals and needs .
Work the phones and greet customers with a friendly helping smile .Loved to interact with customers and help customers with customers's accounts to Acheive customers's financial goals.
Advancement opportunities are abundant.
If you're willing to relocate and make personal sacrifices then you can advance quickly.
"Piece of advice though, negotiate your salary because yearly raises are roughly 1% each year."
this bank are a technology company.
"this bank used to say this bank were a technology company, but this bank's current CEO means it."
Technology is no longer a cost center or order taker for business.
IT must be the business and drive the future.
"this bank has many IT jobs, allows most IT employees to work from home 2 days a week and allows employees out of this bank's footprint to work remotely."
"Some managers are sane, support Some managers's teams and keep the craziness in check."
Others make a mockery of this bank's value of Work/Life Balance demanding unsustainable effort.
Every technologist will say quality is sacrificed to meet dates.
Great place to work.  
this bank is a wonderful place to work.
"The benefits are great, my manager is the best one I've ever had and I do enjoy my job and colleagues."
The only reason I'm considering moving on is to move up.
Typical Corporate Structure.
Standard corporate structure in the banking industry.
Compliance training and updates are frequent.
There are numerous opportunities for growth and development.
this bank jobs.
Good job work life and balance restructure going on right now and jobs are being updated by locations experience is needed with this job training is good and location location is the key to work for this bank
not fun.
I don't think tthis place is a great place to work.
There were too many expectations for low compensation.
this bank had me doing two jobs for the pay of less then one.
No opportunity.
"i love my job, but it seems so far my opportunity to grow and i spend more money going to work and parking that what i get paid."
Even that i work with a good team i need to cover my personal finance needs.
No Management Structure.
The gentleman I was to come work for left within a few months under pressure and after that it was me training and that is about it.
"I originated a little, mostly outside of training I made calls on financial contacts in the area."
Supportive management great place to work.
I moved up to supervisor after working in mail services as a clerk.
"I was mentored, supported and trained by many people in my group and grew my confidence in my learning on the job."
I supported 7 to 2 people on my team in 5 years.
After many process changes I managed and supported my team during challenging times without missing a beat or missing any SLA's.
I coached and supported my team during time off and was always a working manager.
The most enjoyable part of my job is when I problem solved for internal and external customers to came to a happy resolution.
The hard part was coaching team members to give more than team members's job requires to help team members see how important team members were to my team and how much a difference team members made in the company.
I enjoyed working for the company.
Eh the job is ok.
Between the customers and upper management makes the job somewhat difficult highly stressful environment have seen colleagues literally in tears due to the demand of job.
started out happy then they changed.
when the new CEO took over the company really started to decline in supporting the company's employees it was a sad day when i had to chose to leave I feel I had devoted so much time and effort to a company that let me down
good place with benefits.
"the benefits and pay are great, and the flexible work arrangements are awesome, but that also leads to a lack in office culture."
i never get to see the people i work directly with
Overall.
Overall it was a great place to work.
"Co-workers were great, but some management were helpless."
Had many opportunities to move into new positions and succeed.
Its not for everyone.
"The call center, customer service industry is rapidly growing and pays well."
"The hours are very fixed, but there is always opportunity for OT hours."
"The hardest part of the job is not taking things personal, high stress, and fast paced."
"If you're a slow learner, the job isn't for you."
There isn't much room for upward mobility.
"The incentives that are given for meeting metrics, in my opinion make the work place culture disingenuous."
"Most likely, you'll be working from home."
Most of the on-site call centers are closing.
"I do feel that the job strengthened my communication skills, and my ability to effectively multi task."
very faced pace.
"Typical day was answering multiple phone calls, having to help customers with customers's credit cards, questions and problems."
The management wasn't supportive.
Very critical of your phone calls and how you handled customers.
Financial Analyst.
 Reviewed credit applications and assessed risk of individual and commercial clients.
"Upheld regulatory guidelines to guard against fraud and money laundering, and protected customers by stopping suspicious wire transfers."
Increased productivity level of branch by 60% by reaching out to customers with tailor-made solutions.
Go in and work not any options.
This is a good starting point
"but, I have so many years of escalated customer service experience!"
I'm talented and focused on getting the job done with or without help!
Productive events and seminars about this bank benefits.
"I was in charge of finding onsite, and holding seminars and presentations in front of decision makers and employees explaining about this bank benefits provided to decision makers and employees."
Sales culture..
Very good structure of rules and procedures.
Training is excellent.
On going education is excellent.
Sales goals are unreasonable.
"Customer service goals are priority, but sales pressure contradicts the service."
Ok place to work.
It was a decent place to work.
They managed by micro managing every aspect of your day.
It took so much time to make sure you following managements layers of reporting that you never got a chance to actually sell.
Boring place to work.
Just bad management.
Does not appreciate the employees that works at night.
Benefits are good.
Very strict on the quality of work and the productivity.
Nice pay but BRUTAL culture.
"Grateful for the experience,but this bank is trying to catch up with other National Banks and lacks the necessary sales platform needed to do so."
"this bank is still many years behind in innovation of bank software, user friendly online banking, and internal processes especially around investments."
"Jobs are threatened on a daily basis, and employees as a result live in constant fear...even if employees are making employees's sales goals."
"Was great, now ok place to work."
"When I started in 2004, it was a great place to work, slowly over the years, especially since 2013, things changed."
"New leadership from other banks, lack of promotions from within, hiring people from outside the bank."
this bank review.
Overall this bank has given me opportunities to move forward but only up to a certain point.
My salary has been adjusted competitively once but hasn't changed since.
Very competitive and sales driven environment.
Very Poor Pay.
Even though I spent 6 years working for this company I would not recommend anyone working for this company.
My last annual raise was .05 cents.
The turn over rate on branch managers was horrible.
this bank's is an excellent organization to lead to an accomplished career.
this bank's is an excellent organization to lead to an accomplished career.
Management is very supportive in promoting staff internally.
Customer are always welcomed when Customer enter the branches.
Everyone (customers and employees) speak highly of this bank's's culture.
Low pay and always fell short of their 'expectations'.
"From sales goals to customer service scores, it was nearly impossible to get a 'meets expectations' score on the annual performance review."
The worst is the customer service scores.
"Customers are called anonymously by Gallup, and if the customer service scores are not nearly perfect, then the branch doesn't get the branch's incentive payout."
"And furthermore, the employee that received the lower score is placed on an 'action plan'."
Action plans were common; an overshadow over every stressed employee that every stressed employee's job was always on the line.
Instore location.
"I worked inside of a supermarket which was a little unusual for me however, I was able to succeed and show my worth to the company."
I would recommend working for the company to anyone who needs a job living on the bare minimum.
Awesome benefits.
"At this bank employees are offered awesome pay and benefits, along with 3 weeks vacation time."
"Unfortunately, I was not trained properly and management was not willing to help me learn."
"Sadly, it was just not a good fit for me."
nice place to work.  
"this bank is a wonderful place of work, this bank pay fair, but commission wise is not that good."
"I used to work in an in-store location, hours very convenience"
but management took most of weekend off
this bank.
The work environment was always great and the people I worked with were easy to get along with.
I traveled from branch to branch on a daily basis.
It was difficult to adjust to each branches different set of rules.
"Management was unable to give definite answers, always felt like Management were beating around the bush."
At times it felt as though Management was not there to support and develop you.
"The scheduling was pretty inconsistent, working Monday-Saturday and only having an hour trimmed here and there."
Instead of a half day which most would expect and some got.
"But they insist on keeping you under 40 hours, and if you did by chance get overtime there were always questions about it."
Training became too much at times.
You'd finish one set of training and be assigned more to do.
Sometimes you were required to travel for training.
"The incentive was quarterly, and sometimes felt like you weren't given enough opportunity to achieve The incentive."
In my time there I learned a lot about the financial industry.
Overall a good place to work.
Loved my customers.
My manager was fantastic.
My manager Really supported the staff daily and in career advancement.
"Co-workers were absolutely great to work with, however, I did find it to have a clique."
Did not enjoy having to push the products onto customers.
"Also, every week having to call customers to arrange for appointments so that customers could push the products, when it was not in job description."
Great place to start your career.
Typical day at work includes a fair amount of customer contact and reaching out to customers.
I learned a fair amount about the financial industry working with this bank.
They do not allow you a chance to grow within company.
The training is very intensive and expect you to know the position perfectly after only seeing the position once.
They don't give you chance to do great within company.
Good.
SOlid company that is growing quickly.
Culture is very collegial and team oriented.
Work life balance is emphasized and shows.
Regional president model works.
A professional work environment.
"A great opportunity to take initiative and implement strategies to grow the business, improve client experience and reduce risk to the organization.."
"Its a growing division with excellent operating leverage, There is strong leadership at all levels of the business and its created a great reputation in the industry."
I was a Part-Time Teller.
"When this bank took over this bank, it was a change for us all."
"But, when the change of management began, the change of management was not easy."
During the last year working at this bank I had a very bad experience that made me loss confidence in working with the 'branch' I was assigned to.
Management Issues.
You are in so many meetings you have no time to do actual work yet they don't want you charging overtime.
Management does not communicate with each other well and therefore are unable to throttle information down to employees effectively.
Project managers are brought in brand new to the company and changed mid-project and there seems to be virtually no turnover.
Not as great as it used to be..
Job in the branches is now more like telemarketing position.
Have to make outbound calls to try and get customers back in the branch for 'financial well being checkup' i.e. come in so we can sell you stuff.
Turnover is big issue.
All branches are constantly under-staffed but no let up on sales goals.
Solid company but not much growth opportunity in comunity development.
The CDB team is pretty flat with no room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.
Very rewarding work in a very visible and flexible environment.
Expect pay to be less then competitors.
Good culture and opportunities for advancement.
"Overall, this bank has a solid work culture and has opportunities for advancement."
"Monthly goals are followed and will lead to advancement which, can be a positive or negative depending on your working style."
Credit card specialist.
"Great job, great benefits, great pay."
Hard to sit at a desk for 8 hrs a day for me.
Meant a lot of great people there.
Management was great with any questions.
It's okay.
It's okay working there.
It would be nice to receive more money for what we do.
The culture is nice.
The benefits are nice.
I like the supervisors there.
Review Summary.
"I can not review, I still work here currently."
I would not want this posted as many of my colleagues are on LinkedIn.
I could loose my job due to LinkedIn's social media policy.
It's alright.
Management differs heavily between branches.
There are a handful of managers who are willing to work with individuals to seek advancement.
"Most however, either dislike interviewing or are too comfortable with their over inflated bonuses to be willing to risk helping you get promoted and in the process loosing some of that incentive with the new hire."
The claim they pride themselves on promoting from within but as with most banks you will quickly find that they outside hire often.
The only normal internal promotions are within branches when there is again zero risk to the branch manager and the branch manager's bonus.
"Employee culture is excellent, work life balance is very good and the compensation is fair."
The retirement benefits are the most generous portion of the package.
That being said until the internal talent development culture sees a massive shift this bank is at best a great stepping stone on the way to where you want to be.
That is unless you are an outside hire.
Diverse and accommodating environment with room to grow and opportunity to learn..  
this bank has offers employees ample opportunities to learn and develop into roles best suited for employees to succeed.
this bank promotes healthy work-life balance and a sense of camaraderie between management and staff.
long hours not enough pay.
"I worked over 9 hours a day, sometimes 10. is too much work for what I get paid."
"the people I worked with are very nice team but the day is very long, is a 10 hour shift."
Great place to work.  
this bank prides this bank on being inclusive and diverse.
The people that work there are great people.
"Friendly, supportive, kind and helpful."
Depending on the position it can be very stressful.
The pay is good and the benefits aren't bad.
It ok.  
this bank is a nice place to work that all I have I was a contractor and I came in and did my job every day and the people are a good group of people to work with.
Great place to work.
Hard to get paid enough to want to continue.. I worked at this bank for four years learning all I could to advance.
But it seemed on some fronts that it was hard to get ahead unless you knew someone in the ranks.
Sometimes the work is hard when you are dealing with rude clients.
I've had days where clients made me furious and used clients's entitlement to look down on what I did there.
But there were a lot of great times too.
There are some clients who make what you do worth while.
"However, considering all that is required to do the job safely the pay isn't worth it."
Especially if you are working as a teller.
I did the BSSR position and MORE for two years with no pay increase and very little hope of advancement considering the efforts I went through to help bring my branch to greater heights.
"Company is great, RM not so much."
"Overall, Company is a good company to work for."
"However, the regional manager has made it very hard to want to come to work anymore!"
Company've lost a lot of great employees in Company's region due to the regional manager.
"Of course, anywhere you go, not every manager is going to be a great one, but Company is the WORST RM I have ever worked for!"
Far worse than when I worked for Wells Fargo.
"If you want to work for Wells Fargo, I would recommend doing it outside of our region!"
loved it.
Great place to work.
offers good benefits and an onsite daycare where the fees are taking out of your paycheck.
There are plenty of opportunities for advancement within the dept and outside of the dept.
Managers will help you move up
Good company to work for.
"Would recommend to a friend, good company to work for."
"Good work life balance, benefit options were on par with peers."
Company stressed Company's core values a lot and really lived by their core values.
okay.
I am a new employee.
I don't have to much negative to say about this bank.
I was recommended to come over from a competitor.
It is the same everywhere I feel.
Terrible...do not apply!.
"Lack of organization, bad leadership, outdated technology and processes."
Do not recommend working for this lack luster bank.
Terrible terrible terrible
"Old Systems, poor management,."
Very difficult place to work.
"Poor management, excessive politics and infighting."
The computer systems are 'pre-historic' - and have not been updated in over 20 years.
"A task that would take 5 mins in a modern bank like Wells Fargo or BOA, takes hours here."
Wells Fargo or BOA fire Wells Fargo or BOA's employees for absolutely stupid reasons - thereby blemishing their employees's records.
Avoid working for Wells Fargo or BOA.
"Diversified financial services company with major businesses in retail, commercial, retirement and investment management..  "
this bank is an interesting place work at.
"As this bank keep adding acquisitions, the challenges to get the data organized and integrated was getting bigger and bigger."
For anyone who works there has to be prepared to deal with a diverse data environment.
"Good company, bad management."
"A place where the jobs were poorly defined and little management help in establishing features, timelines, or application requirements."
Even project managers had little idea of scope or project requirements and frequently changed project requirements within a couple weeks of project deadlines.
workplace culture.
The culture here is very open to diversity and inclusion.
Along with development of employees to move ahead and be promoted.
The team environment leads to successful teams vs. individual contributions.
Productive.
This was a fun place to work and was at the beginning of my mortgage experience learned a lot.
Enjoyed working with my team great team leader.
"Obtained my experience with interacting with loan officers, title companies etc."
Professional Organization with caring employees that take pride in caring employees that take pride in their community involvement's community involvement.  
this bank is a good company with good people.
Some of the working groups within this bank have opportunities to advance and grow.
Other groups are stagnant or reducing in size and have very limited opportunities.
professionally grow up here.
learn about new field.
professionally grow up here.
learn about new field.
"WE are using a six flag system, doing every month a new field by ' my learning ' classes on line."
grow professionally every day.
I only worked there a very short time.
"I only worked for this bank for a very short time quite a while ago, so I do not feel comfortable providing a review of this bank as an employer."
this bank was a good place for me to start my career and start to learn what I did and did not want in a job.
Wonderful staff who actually care about the work they do and how much the work they do affects peoples lives..
Good health benefits -Friendly and helpful employees/management.
Good work life balance.
Great opportunities for advancement.
Over time available.
Many reward and incentive programs along with good benefits.
I don't recommend taking a position as a Financial Advisor at this bank.
I worked in the and was completely mislead about the position I was hired for.
They tell you that you will be busy all the time with daily appointments set by the branches.
The turnover rate for new employees in that Segment is 100% annually.
So the branches don't setup appointments with the branches's clients because the branches know you will not be there long.
That would have been good to know
productive work environment.  
this bank is a company with a lot of room for advancement.
Good benefits and pay.
Paid holidays and vacations.
Fun work environment.
Helpful support from co workers.
Great company!.
Only reason i left was because i was offered something much higher pay.
Great company and great management!
"I always felt like i had a home there and besides the one, i regret leaving."
Working at this bank.
Everyone enjoys helping you to find the answers you need.
"There is a need for more investment into the masses of the team as locally, there are not a lot of opportunities for the team to gather and social mix with each other."
Competitive Workplace and Environment.  
this bank is a ever-changing banking environment that leaves much room for growth opportunities.
"this bank is still young while also well established which can cause difficulty, yet this bank provides a unique template for learning and gaining experience."
A good place to start your career.
The best part of the job were my co-workers.
my co-workers were family.
As for the workplace culture.
"It was fast pace and you had job quota numbers to reach on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis."
This made for a stressful work environment.
Times are changing.
More goals are being implemented.
Manager only wants 1 teller behind the teller line regardless of how busy the branch is.
Environment is getting bad due to micro-managing.
Rewarding and innovative place to work.  
this bank is always ahead of the curve when it comes to tech savvy products and services.
Very competitive benefits package which includes 401k matching and one of the loan remaining companies which offers a pension plan.
Time well spent.
Received a ton of useful training that will help me advance in my career throughout my life.
my career just won't be at this bank.
The pay was light and the structure a mess.
BSSA/Manager.
The company overall has many opportunities for community involvement if presented to you by upper management.
I worked there through many changes throughout The company.
As The company shifted so did the management.
The work environments were stressful.
The days were long and the staffing was short.
If you didn't email the proper chain and save those emails to back up what you needed help with or to keep abreast on the expectations no one stood up if there was a fire within the branch.
Loss prevention should be more hands on in training staff properly.
After the Wells Fargo scandal we were told to back off selling.
Once the heat died down the pressure was on.
You felt like your job was on the line every day.
Rather being meeting sales goals or being an octopus by doing your job and everyone else's.
There's no team work or comradery in The company.
If your not a puppet you don't matter.
Lacking upward mobility.
Working there is equivalent to watching paint dry.
Adequate training is very seldom.
Employee turnover is rare and you'd probably have better luck working for a temp agency.
this bank ok.
Ups and downs at this bank.
Compensation good.
this bank micro-manage this bank's management staffs and don't allow sense to dictate.
"At Bank Of America the management staff was allowed to run the management staff's branch as the management staff needed, not so at this bank."
Good company.  
this bank is a very good IT bank.
this bank stress on maintaining a very balance work life culture.
Managers as well as people are very friendly and helpful in day today activity.
Field Examination.
Standard testing and analyzation of books and records of this bankBC clients.
The process allows you to work in various industries with a quick learning process of how each business operates.
"Managing various personalities, in an effort to create a relaxing atmosphere for customers to keep the flow of information at a quick pace."
Interesting place to work.
"Coming from a larger financial institution, this bank falls behind in technology and training."
There is no guided training and there are countless systems that should be consolidated into one go ease.
Good Company if you're Good.
Great Company to work for if you are committed to your work.
"Sometimes there are managers who are not necessarily the best breed out there and will make you quit your position - like any corporate; tons of bureaucracy and pay structures changes way too much,"
"it was ok, people were nice but the atmosphere was to conservative."
I worked at a small branch so is was vary slow all the time.
"the training they give you is a joke, they don't teach you half the stuff you need to know."
over all good.
my branch manager was the nicest boss ever!
the goals were alright the products were easy to learn.
every branch is different.
this one was very catty.
but i loved my branch manager and this bank so this bank's a good place to work
Moderate Risk Financial Institution Traditionally Known to Value Its Employees.
Good 'community bank' feel with stability of a large institution.
Does the right things for customers and most of the time for its employees as well.
"Mid-management lacks leadership and mentorship skills, mostly are top operators that needed an avenue for higher pay."
Improved management training needed.
Overall a good and stable company for high performers and low performers alike.
"Not an 'up or out' company, if you are a low performer, just stick to your lane and you'll have a happy and long career."
Top performers are well rewarded but need to remain nimble to align self with the most current and relevant leaders to survive.
Very lax work environment.
Friendly workforce that is very tolerant.
Appreciates diversity.
Remote and flex work schedule friendly / encouraged.
Acceptable benefits structures.
Stressful goal environment.
"I was found by a recruiter through the company, and was very excited to start."
"Offered benefit right away, and acceptable pay."
Remberced for any travel expenses and mileage used for work and training.
the company provide lots of trainings as well.
"Be ware, SO MANY GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS."
Be prepared to be HOUNDED if you are even A LITTLE behind on goal.
"If a client doesn't not want a sale, YOU WILL get the backlash because management assumes you are not selling a sale right."
the company also promote life and family but if you are full time you can work a 6 day week!
30 minute lunches (not long enough)
"You have to use paid time to be off, you can't just take off and it makes work life balance hard."
not a good bank for customer or employee.
Worked in a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door.
"On top of that, this bank does everything in it's power to keep customers out of a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door because this bank cheapest checking account requires customers to do all customers's business through the ATM or customers will receive a monthly fee."
"this bank does not do right by this bank's tellers; this bank do most of the work in a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door, assume all the liability (any bad check will cost you your job), and are expected to reach unrealistic sales goals on a skeleton staff."
"Go into a this bank, it will be empty but for one or two tellers max and their drive thru lines will most likely be shut down as well."
Also I've never seen a company more intent on cramming social justice warrior nonsense down the throats of their employees on a weekly basis as this bank.
They will bombard you with emails and on the internal webpage pushing this agenda and are quick to fire any employee who even slightly objects to their 'shared vision' on these issues.
Great Job.
Good place to work.
this bank cares about employees.
Great benefits.
Issues with outsourced Human Resources but other than outsourced Human Resources I enjoy working for this bank.
A lot of opportunities.
Branch Banking.
Retail banking is a great way to start a career.
The industry is changing into a more digital service while business banking remains the same.
I suggest learning business banking to grow into banking in general.
Good company.  
this bank was a great company to work for.
"When there, I was severely underpaid."
"However, as I understand it now this bank does a much better job with compensation."
I was fired because they said I falsified records.
In actuality I was giving to many fees back.
It was said I recorded wrg.
Reasons for giving fees.
This particular incidence I was told by a manager that they did not even find the incident that was brought forward.
They owed me money for consults and referrals I never received and 2 was before I was fired the referral protocols were changed
Great job if you don't mind working..  
this bank is a good company to work for depending on position.
Work life balance is tested throughout this bank.
Pay doesn't match the work load.
"Besides those reasons, this bank is a good bank to start a financial career."
I don't personally recommend.
On the whole it is a great company.
I truly love some of the things we represent.
There is a great set of programs we are involved in.
However the management isn't worth it.
Other banks pay much more.
Numbers driven company!.
To work at this bank you must be a robotic numbers driven person.
this bank is more concerned with numbers than with recognizing and developing this bank's employee's skills and abilities.
The managers do not believe in taking your ideas to better this bank so you must be a person that likes to only take direction and not use your brain to pitch in.
Demanding. come in early to do night drop and balance ATM(s) clean area by doors opening at 9 am Assist clients in various needs.
Exchanging with others to cover Lobby for Lobby Engagement practices (if you had proper employees to allow this) Take a lunch making sure line and desks are covered.
After lunch repeat the morning activities along with anything you may have to follow up on after having your conversations with clients and determining needs.
"then balance drawer, and card machine and unjam the ATM make sure all security measures are maintained at ALL times."
this bank is focused on making $.
At times this bank's not a bad place to work for.
Other times you better watch your back because this bank will terminate jobs right and left if this bank can get away with it.
Worked for over 20 years in customer service and sales worst company environment.
Extreme sales pressure.
No matter how good with sales and customer service sales and customer service is never good enough!!
You can be a 5 Star employee and never appreciated!!
Under staffed and poorly managed from the branch to the regional sector.
Corporate and retail struggle.
"I've had great experiences and not so great experiences, company lacks consistency from the top to bottom, in retrospect communication wasn't always clear."
enjoyable job.
"Well organized , enjoyed my time here, fixed schedule, incentives, good management, good culture, self developed , organized company overall, good benefits 3 vacation weeks"
OK Company.
"OK Company is an okay company to work for, turnover rate is getting high because OK Company under pay OK Company's employees."
"Benefits are okay, work hours are okay, job security is high because OK Company work with you."
Very good place to work at.
Very good place to work at.
"Enjoyable, fun and quite place to work, very good people, coworkers and managers."
Always trying to help.
"Team work, hours are very good."
"productive, very goal driven without having enough customers."
they are always changing the rules & making exceptions.
Management is good but tends to do everything leaving the rest of the team with barely any customers to make goals.
Good place to work.
"Good place to work, good people."
Great benefits stayed busy learned a lot during the time that I worked there.
A great place to grown and retire from.
Fun workplace with opportunities to grow.
Great company to work for.
Management is always willing to coach and assist to achieve great results.
Team approach is encouraged.
The best part of the job is to help customers to achieve financial well being.
Great place to work.
"Nice place to work, good people, Treat employees well, even if salary is less than market."
"Many long term employees, showing the positive atmosphere."
The downside is that it can be hard to move up the ladder once you are in.
Difficult work/life balance.
"Expected to work well over 40 hours a week as a salaried employee, but docked pay repeatedly if hours don't add up to 40."
Repeatedly forced to come in 6 days a week even if goals were met.
not good.
I was misled about this position and the people currently doing this position are not being led by effective management.
the people currently doing this job are free to do what the people currently doing this job want and the people currently doing this job's results are self reported.
"Great Company, but if you're not a minority you'll be gone quickly."
Read above.
Pretty simple.
"Pretty much if you came into work and did your job, that's all that was expected of you."
"However, if you are a minority, you will get promoted fairly quickly as Great Company prides Great Company on Diversity - Diversity's one of Great Company's core principles."
"Good place, still needs to modernize."
"Great place in terms of values, still needs to catch up to the future."
"Some culture still resilient from 80;s and 90's, despite company growth."
"If you manage to get a good package and a good team, a great place to be"
Fast paced environment.
"As a branch manager, the sales pressure is very high."
Mandatory conference calls up to 4 times a day to ensure one meets sales goals.
You are expected to pass the sales pressure on to the team members.
A second scandal is about to happen.
Frequent change in leadership at operation level.
Hired by a group and then transferred to another group without any leadership and never had any interaction with the head to whom I reported.
Looks the head to whom I reported wanted to have the head to whom I reported's own people and created a frustrating environment to quit .
Love being able to work remotely.
I love the flexibility and ability to work remotely.
Not many opportunities for advancement in the Tampa area.
Low pay.
Bonus structure changing.
Need to provide better pay and opportunities to advance.
Retired Employee.

management here are very big on sales and have a very low error tolerance policy.

Following the company core values.
Pros:Good work/life balance.
Great company for working moms.
Flexible schedule.
Cons: Low pay.
Few opportunities for advancement.
High deductible health insurance.
Good Company.
Good Company to work for.
I entered the bank as an entry level collector and have been able to work my way up and into the Underwriting Department.
I currently verify income for the underwriters which help the underwriters determine the outcome for loan applications.
"Good benefits, work life balance is a priority to the company and the company have a decent 401k matching percentage are reasons to stick around."
I have made some wonderful friends around the office over the last 10 years and have felt very secure in my job.
Productive work environment..  
this bank is a fine company to work for.
The work atmosphere is quiet the office is a 'green' building
so it's hard to hear.
Management is awesome.
The hardest part of the job is the job's always changing.
Dream job.
"My work day usually revolved around running various reports, helping the loan officers get the loan officers's loans entered, resolving any issues surrounding their loans, marketing efforts, expense reports, travel arrangements, calendaring, meeting coordination and general administrative assistance to the Market Manager/Regional Manager."
Productive Workplace.  
"this bank gave you plenty of opportunity to learn the job and succeed in the job, sending you to training classes and training online during employment."
Amazing place to start a career!.
"Was amazing, I have nothing bad to say about the place, I moved back to NY and still use this bank as my bank, this bank are just the best at what this bank do."
"Unfortunately i had to move, and there's no this bank's out here."
The last several years in this firm have represented a great deal of change in systems and management.
A typical day at work might involve calendaring and problem solving for various managers and team members.
It can be exciting and challenging to reach the correct party for solutions of the upgraded systems.
"The workplace culture is spoken of very favorable by management, but the talk and the walk of the organization are not always in sync."
I enjoy working with my team members.
ups and downs.
decent company to work for.
advancement is possible but it takes a while for them to consider you.
"its a job, if you do your job then its easy."
Decent incentive.
Great place to work.
I enjoy my tenure at this bank
but I feel I have no further opportunity..  
this bank is a Great Workplace and I thought I would retire from this bank.
In the last 7 years here in Florida I learned and had an awesome experience in Weston.
I love my clients and my clients are very loyal to me.
I feel as though every time I try to advance there is always an obstacle.
I have given my entire life to this bank and thought with my excellent track record this bank would help me advance my career sooner rather than later!
work place.
"Goal oriented, many tasks to complete in short time."
"Many functions, great customer service, fast learning requirements."
Answering and making daily goals sales phone calls.
Typical big corporation mentalilty.  
"this bank maintains that this bank cares for this bank's employees, when all this bank really cares about is sales, sales, sales."
"this bank push this bank's employees to the point of burn out, then look for reasons to terminate your employment."
"this bank does not take into account local management opinions, or knowledge of this bank's direct employees performance."
"When this bank want to fire someone, this bank do it regardless of your immediate supervisor's opinion."
Corporate Employee Relations 'tells' Managers what to do in matters of employee terminations.
It is not a 'collaboration' as they claim.
"Those decisions come from a far away state, from a corporate level, from people who know nothing about you personally, or professionally."
Productive workplace with a great work/life balance.  
this bank is a great company to get a foot in the door with the financial industry with vast opportunity for advancement.
Unfortunately this bank do no pay this bank's employees appropriately compared to national averages.
Work/Life Balance.
Great work life balance if you are in the correct department.
This is dependent upon your manager.
this bank struggles with promoting from withing.
"Instead of investing in training for this bank's currently employees, this bank hire externally"
Great Company.  
this bank takes pride and ownership in this bank's employees.
I had one on one coaching skills that developed me into the banker that I was for this bank.
this bank cares about this bank's employees personal lives and worked with me when things came into the equation.
I am very grateful for the 4 years with this bank and the management that I had along the way.
"Good place to work, great benefit options.  "
this bank overall I think is a really great company to work for.
this bank have great benefits offered to this bank which I think are competitive with other employees.
Raises are semi-annually to yearly depending upon performance.
"this bank does not offer overtime, which allows for a healthy work/life balance."
"Full time employees are offer paid vacation plus the benefits of health, vision, dental, retirement and more"
great at first down the road not so much.
"When you are first hired on it is awesome, money wise."
But once you have been there for awhile no more raises.
Staffing is always changing and they get hired on minimum 15.00 an hour with no experience.
Poor upper management skills and training in AML department.
Management is not educated or trained to manage.
Hiring decisions are based on personal preference.
Management fails to utilize the experience and skills of the employees Management have to make decisions
Company overall does not care about employees.
My ratings are based on my feelings about the above statement.
"Management changes frequently, morale overall very low."
Corporate culture leaves a lot to be desired.
Okay work culture.
very laid back at the Brecksville office.
Slow work pace.
conservative culture.
but provides good work life balance.
good people.
small cafeteria.
no gym
Great employer.
Very busy day to day operations.
The management was great in my dept.
I worked with a great team of people.
Very great experience in learning banking.
Good place to work.
I worked at this bank when this bank merged with Midlantic Bank in the back office and enjoyed the work as the work was very challenging.
There was always something to learn and people willing to train you.
I do not have much to say.
They really needed help as far as management and co workers.
i worked at three different branches and they cut my training short
so i didn't really know much i had to learn as i went
and i only had a branch manger for the 1st month that i was there.
Comfy Retail Banking Job.
Not paid quite as high as some other banks.
Benefits may be better or at least comparable.
this bank will NEVER fire an employee for lack of sales.
Be prepared to endure a ton of micromanaged behavioral activities.
My review.
The company was okay to work for but The company didn't offer me career advancement.
The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and talking to the customers.
Opportunity to Grow.  
this bank expends a lot of money on getting this bank's new employees on board with this bank culture.
It is up to you to make the best out of the many opportunities this bank offer.
So far Im happy working for this bank.
Benefits are great if you work full time.
Nice Company.
It was a nice place to work for after they bought out bank N. Good work/life balance.
Learned a lot of new things during my time there.
Many different departments to choose from.
this bank Review Summary.
Very stressful call center environment.
From the moment you punch in your availability your phone will ring.
Very seldom do you finish a call and have a moment to regroup before the next call is coming through.
Grading of calls by quality staff is inconsistent and information given to customers is inconsistent as well.
Managers typically do not challenge scores from quality which effects the bonus you would earn.
"Some slow times, fast paced financial environment."
"I enjoyed working with the staff, the sales requirements and constant sales reminders made the job stressful."
"Also, there is a lot of on the job training."
That is very good
Great Company.

A competitive bank.
"The bank was very competitive in terms of high sales driven goals, with incentives paid accordingly."
The bank had a family atmosphere which was enjoyable and comfortable to work in
Management does not have experience in areas Management manage..
"In general benefits are fine, but Management expects excessive hours during the week, including weekends."
Promotions are difficult to get.
You have to be careful what positions you try to post for in the internal job posting system.
Job descriptions are not accurate.
Excessive internal politics.
Company is successful.
"Merit increases are low, if any, including bonuses."
Re-organizations occur often and you have nothing to say in re-assignments.
meh.
"Hired as a banker, but was never given the opportunity to be a banker."
If you are hired as a branch sales and service associate/ universal banker prepare yourself to spend 95% of your time on the teller line making only your base wage
"Fast paced, energetic technology company with a bank front end."
Equal parts exhausting and rewarding.
Long hours and very high pressure timelines with lofty expectations.
That said the rewards of being successful in this environment make it all worth it.
"Good culture, improving comp, solid product lines."
"Great place to work, undergoing some changes."
Client focused.
Strong compliance culture with excellent attention to risk management.
Improving compensation programs.

Benefits are standard for the industry.
this bank is a middle of the road bank in terms of base salary but decent quarterly bonuses.
"Busy, busy busy!!."
"Though I know I enjoyed working at this bank, it was over 10 years ago."
I remember my coworkers were extremely friendly and we used to go out to dinner together fairly often.
"The branch manager wasn't the best to work for, as The branch manager was new to The branch manager's position but the head teller was AMAZING!"
I felt like they really cared about each other here.
The hardest times were during the busiest days.
When social security checks and paychecks came out.
It was so fast paced and hard to keep up but we all pulled through together!
Fast-paced and collaborative data entry.

N/a. As a manager it is very stressful.
They expect you to get things done in 40 hours but you are given things that would take you 70 hours a week to do.
"They add stress not only to your work life, but to home life too."
Good place to start a career..
Get licensed.
It was a fun place to work as a young person out of college but it was best used as a launching pad for where I really wanted to go.
The salaries are low for the amount of revenue they generate.
Forward Thinking.

this bank micro manage and pressure you to sell.
Nothing you do seems good enough

Great Management & Leadership.  
this bank allowed me to transition into banking comfortably.
"My manager was a wonderful leader, mentor and coach."
My assistant manager who I worked closely with was patient and always available.
this bank will allow you to grow within this bank as long as you have the desire to succeed.
The downside with this bank was the requirement to send referrals to bankers from the teller side.
"Other than the need to refer products and services, this bank was a great company to work for."
It was a pleasure to work under great leadership
N/a. Love the job and the people I work definitely would recommend the job to everyone if banking is for you I say go for banking.

I love not only this company but the business as well.
"Current employee, Benefits are great."
Company with great benefits.

Pay is not worth it.

Consistent work structure with routines that allowed for expectations to be understood and met.
Branch work environment allowed for comfortable work atmosphere with associates.
Customer service based.

"To assist the management team during the day with bank traffic, so that no one employee or manager is overloaded."
Team work all day.
Communication is key.
Hardest part of the job would be working and dealing with fraud.
The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to help customers see customers's finances differently.
workplace and growth.
"job was great in management, flexibility, culture and requirements of job."
Training was given and job was an overall great job.
The only thing is job security was bad.
Low paying advancingjob.
You can advance at this bank if you can tolerate the low pay for awhile.
They're maternity leave policy is horrible.
It's stressful work for the little pay you receive.
You're constantly watched and not in a good way.
Great place to work.  
this bank was a great place to work I feel like I gained a lot of experience working there.
The people I worked with were great as well as the supervisors and the supervisors were always there to help if needed
Great Place of Employment.
"Very collaborative, fair wages, promotion prompt, willing and ready to help all who desire to advance."
Rated as number one place of employment of my resume.
Great Company.
Working with this bank was great.
I say with because this bank do whatever this bank can to include you as a part of the team rather than some this bank pay.
this bank's training is the best I've had.
The hardest part of my job was working from home and making that transition.
That type of work is for some people and not for others.
"Unfortunately, That type of work was not for me."
this bank also does not let you transition back if you find it unfitting.
"Instead, you must wait 6 months to complete all training to move."
"Great benefits, retirement, time off."
"Great place to work for someone looking to get into the financial sector, starting pay is good as well as company benefits."
time off is better than that of most entry level positions.
Not great.
"Hostile work environment, many if not all coworkers disliked each other and made thinly veiled comments about many if not all coworkers."
Manager did little to nothing to address or diffuse the situation
Bad Workplace.
The company does not care for The company's employees.
I find it hard to advance in The company.
The company always say experience matters over everything else.
It is very gossip filled culture.
"Decent job, great benefts."
I learned a lot about finance and mortgages.
"The management have difficulty stock of what The management's employees' complaints or suggestions regarding functionality of systems, but do try to accommodate The management's employees with day to day necessities."

Great work environment and management.
This job gives you every opportunity to excel in your role.
this bank's training programs are top notch.
In my experience management wanted to help you grow in your role.
Compensation could be higher.
None.
"Through face-to face interactions with customers, I had the opportunity to provide top- notch customers service handling financial transactions accurately and efficiently."
I spent my day having professional and friendly interactions with both customers and team members
Good Company.  
this bank was a good company to work for.
this bank is a company that is widespread and growing.
I was only there for six months after this bank purchased the company that I was with.
Good work place good management.
I liked working at this bank it was a exciting job dealing with all nature of people and cultures.
Dealing with Attorneys and the courts.
The co-works were always willing to help each other if needed we where a team.
needs improvement.
work was repetitive.
everyday we came in and did the exact same thing.
Nobody had fun we weren't even allowed to talk and or have conversations like other departments.
Nobody wanted to participate in the fun activities the ' enthusiastic employees' tried to push for.
The colleges either talked about you and made it comfortable or was blatantly rude and did not care.
"Other than that, yeah work was fine unless you wanted a raise or advancement."
Learning a new job.
"Assisting all customer needs, cash and deposit checks, open and close accounts, settle and replenish ATM, order and ship money, settle teller and branch settlements"
Nice people to work with.
"People are generally nice to deal with, work life balance is OK, low turn-over rate, plenty of training opportunity, company culture is OK, promotion is not easy though"
Too Long Ago.
My time at this bank was over 20 years ago.
This gap in time makes my comments about this bank no longer meaningful.
I did enjoy my time there and would recommend my time there to others.
Excellent Team Environment.
"When in the proper environment with a strong team, this job can be competitive, but collaborative and fun!"
"The universal model that this bank is shifting towards gives a great opportunity to advance sales, but can be difficult when having to focus on teller capabilities too."
"Overall, the team environment is a make or break topic as far as hitting your incentives."
Honestly a great company.
The resources and training given to employees for the opportunity to advance employees's knowledge and career is very well conducted.
The department leads and mangers are mostly really good people who want you to succeed and will work with you on whatever you care to improve upon.
a great company has a great culture inclusive of all people and backgrounds.
"nice working environment,."
My front desk receptionist position was okay.
"They wanted me to help with insurance calls on their financed equipment, but I was not fully trained and they claimed they were short staffed."
"I finally told them I did not feel comfortable making insurance calls on their financed equipment as I did not know what I was suppose to be requesting and when asked questions from agents, I really didn't know what to say."
OK bank to work for.
Pay was good.
"Management was OK, but Management didn't communicate well with us."
Too many meetings and not enough tellers to cover on busy days.
Goals were fair.
Fun and productive place to work which compensated me well.
A typical day at work for me consisted of being on the phones with my customers internal and external.
I learned about the home preservation programs which were created to assist customers with staying in customers's homes.
My Manager was extremely knowledgeable about the Mortgage loan servicing process and investor guidelines.
My manager was helpful not just to me but any departments.
The culture was diverse.
The hardest part of my job was delivering foreclosure sales to customers and the most enjoyable part of work was advising borrowers of borrowers's approval for hone retention options.
Fast-paced and demanding.
This position required a lot of research and resolution of customer issues with very structured deadlines.
This position in highly regulated to ensure customer needs were met.
"stable worplace, little room for advancement.  "
this bank is a good company to work for however there is little room for advancement.
I often did not feel valued or supported by management.
There was little recognition for exceptional performance.
Great place to work.
"I loved working at this bank, the managers were great at teaching you to be a better employee, co-workers shared best practices that would help everyone out, some managers would create a fun and competitive atmosphere, be prepared though to deal with aggressive and unfriendly customers every now and then, some managers would say terrible things over the phone"
Excellent company.
I loved working at this bank until I became disabled.
"However; there computer systems and programs were unable to allow the use of speak to type programs such as Dragon, etc. accommodations required to meet my disability requirements or reduced hours."
"Therefore, I was unable to return."
"In addition, after being LTD, there was no current job opening in my department."
customer care center.
The customer care center in Kalamazoo was an exceptional workplace.
youthful.
The customer care center in Kalamazoo is a great place to work.
I would recommend The customer care center in Kalamazoo to others looking for a position in banking.
Job security is good.
Is a good place to work.
The chance for advancement is great if you are willing to work hard.
Great benefit which is hard to find these days.
Hardest part of the job is doing straight data entry for 8 to 9 hours a day.
Good place to work.
I would recommend this bank to any and everyone.
A great environment to work in.
"Great benefits- 401K, pension, healthcare ect."
Management guides you without micro managing.
Customer Service Representative.
"Inbound calls 70-100 calls per day Service customers and resolve issues Multitasking is in high demand in this positionThe hardest part can be dealing with irate customers constantly (it can be very mentally draining)Always room for advancement or working in a different departmentThe company hires internally first The pay is good to start- plenty of opportunity for raises Incentive bonuses departmentThe company receive benefits at a discounted rate I gave a 3, because frontline agents can be borderline verbally abused by customers-- departmentThe company cannot disconnect the line30 minute lunches- pack your lunch to maximize your timescheduled adherence is strict, not much room for errorssometimes I feel my position is based on quantity not the quality of the work"
this bank Taught Me A Lot.
I learned so much while working at this bank.
I traveled a lot with my job.
I gained so much experience and I am grateful.
I recommend this bank for job seekers.
this bank is a great place to work.
Don't work there.
They fired me for being a Veteran.
Couldn't prove it of course.
"But that is the only reason possible as last I heard, they were still using my code."
"Additionally, they primarily hire non-Americans to write critical code that can't go more than a month before having a Sev 1 failure."
flexible with school scheduke.  
"this bank is a good place to work while you are in school, most departments you can make your weekly schedule so it makes your weekly schedule flexible."
The breaks are short and the calls can be very stressful.
"However, the pay is pretty good."
"OK place to work, but Mgr was no help."
"Not a bad company to work for, but there was a lot of manager turnover."
"The systems were in place, but processing was not very efficient."
The regional manager resigned a few weeks prior to me and the branch manager resigned the same day I did.
Good people.
"A nice place to work, great colleagues."
The interview process was short and was offered the job within a week.
"this bank is also customer friendly, making sure that this bank's products are matched to this bank's customers financial needs."
Great place to work.
The company is a great place to work.
The company allow you to grow and advance within The company and provide continuing education.
Salary and benefits are great.
Great Company and Workplace.
Hard to move up because of all the outside hires.
"Although trained and has the abilities to do what they ask, opportunities are limited due to whatever reason."
Seems to be a bit of favoritism.
very stressful.
An average day at this bank can be very stressful.
Very high pace work load but over all the daily & at times hourly changes can be a bit much
but it was nothing that I couldn't handle.
I am a very happy and cheery person and some seem to be annoyed with that.
What I enjoyed about the job was my customers and servicing my customers to the best of my ability
Looking for new possibilities..
"I am a hard worker, with many years of experience."
I manage my team and help when needed with other teams in our department.
"Learned many different products within our department, including Export and Import Letters of Credits and documentary collections."
Looking for new possibilities.
Cool place.  
this bank has been a cool place to work.
I've been there for almost 23 years.
The only issue that I've noticed is lack of diversity in upper management.
lack of diversity in upper management and the raises aren't much to be desired.
Stressful.  
"this bank is a great job, but this bank can be extremely stressful."
"The company is very big on micromanaging, and for some job security is not certain."
There are great networking opportunities.
Don't apply for the operations specialist position.
The operations specialist/associate position was extremely stressful!!
I was being micromanaged everyday.
The operations specialist/associate position is a fast paced production environment and it would be more beneficial if the managers didn't hover over you while you're working it's ridiculous.
I would've preferred the ability to focus on doing my job.
"If you enjoy stress, your breaks and bathroom breaks timed to the last second, and micromanagement my job is for you!"
I feel so much better now that I no longer work there.
They really take care of you.  
"this bank takes great care of this bank's employees, this bank."
"However, this bank are also the lowest paying financial institution on the market."
A good place to start your banking career.  
this bank provides a very extensive training program to help build knowledge and gain an understanding of Bank Regulations.
There is limited room for advancement which makes this bank a good place to start your career.
Stressful.  
"this bank, when hiring tellers, should let interviewees know that interviewees are basically being hired to sell and telemarket."
If you reach your goals you're told to do more.
If you don't meet your goals you will be disciplined or this bank will find reasons to replace you.
Teller skills are not at the top of this bank's list of requirement.
It's all about the sales.
"Even if you get a decent immediate manager, the upper management can be brutal."
"Good company, if you're in Pittsburgh.  "
this bank is definitely a super regional bank.
"Despite this bank's numerous acquisitions and forays into the national market, this bank remain a Midwest Bank in approach."
"Croneyism exists in large measure, and senior leaders rise directly from that small corridor that exists between Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Philadelphia."
this bank's Southeast US operations never received the full attention and energy needed to succeed and will retain Their Southeast US operations's 1-2% market share perpetually.
Management Structure.
"The management structure needs some work, or at least that what seems to be the case on my department."
"Each department seems to work as Each department's own island, governed by the head of Each department."
Overall a good company to work for.
"good company to work for, pay was on a bit low side, management is understanding, people work together well, location I worked at was in suburbs, low customer flow,"
The Good and The Bad.
Some of the managers are full of ego but the others are great.
"The salary is NOT nearly enough for the amount of stress and difficult customers you have to deal with, let alone a living wage."
"Yes, the health insurance, discounts, and the few paid days off are great."
If they were to up the hourly wage to at least $16 the jobs would be worth it.
worst place i ever worked.
"After being an analyst for several years elsewhere, I made the sad mistake of going to this bank."
This was now for me several years ago and I am still scarred by the experience.
Job Shop.
Massive work area - a lot of space.
Heavy workload.
Direct manager was excellent.
Fast paced.
Disappointing customers when appraisals were not signed off on.
Working with customers
Great For Someone With A Family.
This job offers great benefits and a lot of advancement opportunities.
"The pay is great , even as a part time employee I had full time hours."
full time hours are fixed so you always know which hours your working.
Some areas are better than others.....
"There are some great aspects to working for this company -- some locations offer casual attire and some business units are permitted to WFH, with reasonable limitations when you do WFH."
You get to work with a wide array of people across locations - which is both challenging and interesting.
There is talk about 'challenging the status quo' but should you levy a challenge a challenge is often not well received.
There is frequent change of leadership with in the teams - which is disruptive and prevents continuity.
"this company do have a liberal internal job posting practice, but moving with in can be challenging."
Despite qualifications for open positions.
hiring is based more on who you know than what you know - which is extremely discouraging.
I feel there is not a gender pay gap at this company.
The pay grades and comp structure is based on the job - not who fulfills the job.
Which is a plus!
The typical work day is filled with conference calls.
"Some of which are helpful, others that are not a good use of ones time."
Health benefits are not great.
Plans have a high deductible and out of pocket expenses.
"Plans are generous with vacation time, etc."
After you meet a required time of service you can even purchase another weeks vacation.
Most managers are accommodation with Dr's appts etc.
"For those considering working here, i would ask questions during the interview process and make sure you are comfortable before you accept any offers."
"If you want to achieve a certain level, career wise, ask what you need to do etc."
Career path'ing is NOT a strong point at this company.
this company consider - more...
Bad just bad.
The company dose not give annual raises unless your perfect The company never promote from with in.
The company don't care about The company's employees I was verbally abused by my trainer and was told that's just how my trainer is and to deal with it
overall a good place to work.
"thought that the grass looked greener but was wrong, should have stayed with the organization."
Good pay with opportunity to grow from within.
Although management could use a little help management seem to be getting better
Great Place.
I have enjoyed working for this bank!
this bank are a great company to work for with tons of room to grow.
"We have a great 401K plan, and benefits."
Along with locations all over the US
valuable experience.
"counting large sums of money, depositing customer money and checks, selling credit management was very knowledgeable and helpful the workplace culture was happy and team like the hardest part of the job was business banking the most enjoyable part was the family like atmosphere"
Typical large regional bank.
"Typical large regional bank - a lot of policies and rules to follow, customer service driven, plenty of different opportunities to pursue, benefits are decent, compensation is average, results driven atmosphere"
Back Up Daycare for Employees.
The one thing I loved about this bank was there was a back up daycare at my location.
"I was able to bring my child/children to a back up daycare at my location in an emergency, such as current school being closed."
Camps in the summer was very convenient as well.
Typical Bank.
There is a lot of brown nosing in this company.
its not what you know but who you know when it comes to advancement but other than that this company's a decent company to work for.
this company stands behind this company's brand and is about giving great customer service.
if you're good with people this may be the job for you
Do not fall for this bank's promises.
Micromanagement at its best.
"All about sales and numbers at the end of the day, despite what this bank tell you."
"If you are a seasoned banker, stay away from this bank."
this bank wants inexperienced people so this bank can mold inexperienced people into what this bank think a banker should be.
this bank do not value experience.
Pay is woefully short compared to this bank's competitors.
this bank think this bank's process is the end all to be all.
"If there is a problem, this bank believe the people are a problem and not this bank's process."
Very arrogant bank.
nice people.
Nice people but very sales orientated lot of pressure to sale felt like I was attacking people everyday with the same questions and offers even if people say no it is expected to ask over and over again.
This location.. All fun and games.
"This location was all fun and games, did not take there work seriously which made my position hard as I was looking for a career and not a job."
I thought this bank was a successful company and hired people that wanted to be successful as well.
Check your personality at the door..
If you are part of the clique - you are golden.
Don't come in here trying to be an individual.
this bank is all about metrics but does little to nothing with anything this bank encounters that does not go along with the current storyline.
Good local company.
Good benefits.
I did not work with this company long enough to give any thought to a review.
this company helped prepare me for what I needed.
It's nice that this company's a local company and you have opportunities to move to all different departments.
Laid back place to work.
"Customer service focus, typical day on auto dialer taking outbound and incoming calls fast pace enviorment."
"Good culture base, enjoyable part of the job was to satisfy the customer, to reach your goals in regards to montior requirments within the calls."
"What I learned was how to handle irate callers as well as being a teamplayer, how to stay customer focus and friendly at the same time."
xcelant place to work.
I am very luck working with this bank Bless by God such a nice team my manager my coworker every body even my customers my Regional My mentors my faciliters every one.
Good place to work.
helped me learn how to problem solve with fast pace work environment.. remain confident in a fast intense work environment.
if there was any simple questions you would have to self problem solve.
very diverse workplace.
i enjoyed employee appreciation week.
"Flexible work environment, but there are trade-offs."
There are pluses and minuses to working at this bank.
"Positives - flex schedule and work from home, Negative - heavy outsourcing with sub-par quality workers, heavy process, and slow to implement."
"If you work here, expect heavy process and strict procedures, many constraints to performing your job, mass approvals needed for just about everything, and an 'over-the-top' amount of required documentation."
"The approval process is so heavy that The approval process loses the intent, i.e., approvers select 'approved' without reviewing."
"this bank tries to cut costs by outsourcing to OffShore and OnShore (non-US citizen) resources, but quality suffers."
"Cultural differences are apparent in quality of work, work ethic, and efficiency."
"Projects take an unreasonable amount of time to complete, and end up being costly."
"I wish upper management would understand that upper management are losing quality employees to less qualified, and less dedicated employees."
"The non-US contracted resources are initially less expensive, but end up costing this bank and shareholders much more."
"On the up-side, this bank tries to institute a work-life balance during the holidays, and avoids scheduling production deployments during the holidays."
The work from home option is wonderful.
"The work from home option saves on commute time, and provides a quieter environment to work."
Great workplace.
Great work place.
Great management.
Flexible schedule/hours.
Can do part time/full time.
Good for high school graduates.
Many branch locations.
Many positions available for advancement.
Worked from home.  
this bank was a part time home job that I worked from home.
I loved the clients and the job but this bank would never allow full time for that position.
I learned a lot about online banking which helped me in my personal banking.
Management changed a lot so sometimes you did not know who to call on if you needed help or had a question.
Its Ok.
"Its a typical banking environment however, moving up in the company is is not the easiest of task."
"Also, the compensation is not the best."
The area I worked in was also not the best
Part-Time Teller.
Being a teller was interesting.
You get the opportunity to know your customers who most of time are regulars of the bank you are assigned to.
"Then, you get the opportunity to be a floater - which mean you are assigned to another bank to work if needed."
Great place just wished paid more.
Enjoyed working at this bank.
Had pretty set schedule and office environment was nice.
"however, didn't like low pay and difficult to advance within your local branch."
"productive work place environment, good co-workers."
Was a great place to learn the work place environment of a large corporation.
the work place environment of a large corporation was a fast place with high demands of the people who worked there.
Very rewarding.
Enjoyed workimg in the Operations Center - back office banking..
Worked for this bank in this bank's Operations Center for roughly 11 years.
Overall a very good experience.
Management was fair and very interested in employee satisfaction.
"Seemed Management fell behind a bit technologically, but were taking steps to catch up."
Salary was very fair and health benefits were adequate.
"No career advancement, low pay, and undervalued."
"It's impossible to move up, the pay does not cover cost of living, and this company don't really care about you at all."
Every day is the same and very boring.
"If you're boring, this company is for you."
"If you're willing to just settle for a comfortable job because 'at least you'll have a job,' this company is for you, if you're looking to be broke and not take nice vacations, get a job here."
"If you like to struggle to save money, get a job here."
"If you want terrible health insurance and love medical bills, this company is just for you."
"N/a. great company for consumers, very technology advanced."
Not good pay for the amount of stress and legal things that you deal with.
Not good enough pay for the amount of work that you do
Sad to see company chang.
Used to be a great company.
a great company's not as great as before.
Low salaries and only new employees will get more money but then once only new employees are here only new employees are stuck.
Lots of cliques
this bank.
Great place to work especially when you have a family.
Pay is low for price of living.
this bank have advancement opportunities.
Sales oriented culture.
overall good
Productive place to work.
Overall people are good to work with.
A lot of red tape to get jobs accomplished.
Impossible to get raise.
Overall seem to take care of employees for long term.
A lot of 20 year and longer employees.
Review.
The job was through an agency and i was not picked up by the company.
I enjoyed working for the company but the training process was not there.
Thank you
Enjoyed working with all my co-workers.
"Was a small town bank until this bank bought a small town bank, so I knew some of the customers that came in already."
I really enjoyed working with the public nd always have.
I worked at branch level through out my career at this bank.
The branch environment is fun to work with..
"Having a good relationship with immediate managers, peers and team will make a difference ."
Employees get opportunities to learn and grow within the branch setting.
Nice place to work and learn about banking.
It was a nice place to learn about banking.
Not fast paced at all and the managers and crew were nice enough to help you out when you needed it.
The clients were also nice and most were regulars that you got to know after a while
work load.
Work load to high and not enough people to cover shifts and every thing has to be done like yesterday in this environment.
everything is in high demand and upper management don't care about new Ideal and technology that is out there.
upper management always shut down your ideals for in this company to grow and evolve.
security is so high you cant work.
Great company.
I absolutely loved working for this bank.
The only reason I left is that I was presented with an opportunity making substantially more money without the hour long commute.
Have every intention of re-applying there during my job search.
Relexed place to work for. worked in trading room sending wires to buy trades and received wires in for selling it was nice company to work for was laid off for down sizing ..
Competitive sales driven family.
Your Typical 9-5 costumer service/ Sales job.
Teaches you compassion
but it helps if you can discern the truth.
Management is active in your development and actively foster a type of workplace family culture.
The hardest part of the job is dealing with costumers but the job can also be the best.
Rhayshar Lane.
Typical day at work:
"Morning log-in, work is distributed each hour."
"What I learned: I learned a lot in this role, my training was excellent ."
Management: excellent .
culture was good.
"No hard parts to the job, just come into work, focus on my training and make sure I am not making errors."
enjoyable part is working with a supportive team
This was an entry level job..
Banking gave me the experience to enter the work force.
Training was quick with precision.
"Overall, progress and advancement was very very slow."
There were challenges and skills acquired in cash and fraud management where I performed very well and even above the call of duty.
Professional working surroundings.
Great place to work!!
Always learning new things on a day to day basis.
Friendly staff and customers.
I got to dress professionally everyday and work in a very clean environment which was a big change from my last job.
Decent workplace.
It's a good workplace.
"However, be prepared to be micromanaged."
There are constant sales goals to meet and your manager will expect you to always stay proactive to meet constant sales goals to meet.
Management.
"I worked for this bank for almost 5 yrs, the first 3 yrs were awesome"
and then I got a new manager and everything went down hill.
I saw 20-25 people come and go during that almost 2 yr period.
"I kept saying that I was going to leave, until one day they made my decision for me."
I miss the customers the most.
I now know that politics and loyalty cannot exist in a working environment.
I wish Management knew that.
this bank.
I enjoyed working for this bank.
"The training was extensive in the Loan Solutions department, but the training in the Sanction Screening department was more of a self-taught situation."
you get out what you put in.
too big.
good room for advancement if you know people.
people paid for my education but wouldn't give me a job in the field people sent me to school for.
Great Company.
Very friendly management.
Everyone seemed to get along and like to work together.
Team-lead always had my back and departments got along well.
Didn't have to be afraid to ask questions or ask for help/training.
I miss working there.
Productive and well managed company.
I loved working at this bank Financial Services.
Excellent executive management.
Good management training available and required.
Good place to develop your career.
"Collaborative, fun, hard working environment"
Customer Care Center is Cancer.
Customer care center should have been a path to other positions within the company.
"You learn a lot about banking here and deal with customer over the phone, but Customer Care Center is dead end position."
You can advance within the telephone center but outside of the telephone center it's impossible.
You are on a tight schedule as they monitor your work time on the phone.
"And when I had scheduled time off to talk with HR, HR missed my appointment twice."
"HR offered little more than, 'Oh, HR forgot.'"
I started with a training class of 30 people after 1 year there was 5 of a training class of 30 people left.
All fired or quit.
Sad.
Competitive.
"Very Competitive environment, pushed to get goals, very stressful working in a 100% commission job, finding clients to sell too, and finding the right customers."
Need Moore strategy When it comes to projects.
"Major issues surrounding operations and systems, need to invest into technology to help reduce long processes and human error."
Too many redundancies and lack of vertical alignment in compliance.
Ability to grow and learn various functions within the company.  
this bank at that time was merging with a few banks.
I worked through two acquisitions.
Work environment was great a real family oriented place to work.
My managers were involved with the community and we were kept abreast of services we could implement.
The transition became turbulent which lead to a lack in oversight of sustainability in some branches.
easy as home...
2-3 early morning call per week..
2-4 interviews per week.
"2-5 trouble shootings, including developing new environments and migration to newer versions as well week fixes for various vulnerabilities"
It's a good place to work if you're just starting..
Banking is good at this bank and working is okay.
"It's low paying and very dumbed down, but it's a good place to get your foot in the door if you plan to work elsewhere in banking."
good place to work.
meet all requirements of the job.
meets all deadlines on time.
gets along well with all peers.
detail orientated.
works well without supervision.
always on time for work and only takes off on scheduled day.
unless illness is scheduled by a doctor
Likeable.
"I worked 8 hrs a day, 40 hrs a week."
My direct supervisor was great and really helped in any way My direct supervisor could.
The pay just wanted competitive enough especially working in town and needing to pay for parking.
Changing Culture.
Moving toward a micro management culture with high pressure sales.
Limited advancement outside of retail.
Branch daily life is focused on sales activities and setting appointments with existing clients.
job.
Like transferring to they all their data and able to login's data to new computers.
Make sure they all their data and able to login all they all their data and able to login's data and able to login have access all they all their data and able to login's application.
Great people to work with
Very Friendly Work environment.  
this bank has a very friendly work environment at least in this bank's Vertical.
Managers are open to new ideas and designs which makes sense for this bank.
Good Work life balance.
Terrible Management.
I had the absolute WORST manager I think was even possible.
At one point the absolute WORST manager I think was even possible had told one of the girls that I had worked with that one of the girls that I had worked with didn't like one of the girls that I had worked with's outfit that day and that one of the girls that I had worked with looked 'like one of the girls that I had worked with belonged on a corner somewhere'.
The pay was okay.
Nothing special.
Solid Company - Direction in Retail constantly changing.
"Overall, a great organization."
"I think once we determine what direction we want to commit to in terms of the retail platform, we are going to take the retail platform to another level.."
this bank is great place to work for working mothers.  
this bank gives awesome mother's benefits and time off for new working mothers.
this bank offer a great work/life balance.
this bank offer competitive pay that is right up there with other banking institutions.
"It is just hard to move up, and hard to know what is available to you--even if you ask...at least in the market I am in."
Terrible place.
Started off ok then after being there 3 years was let go because of a 'procedure violation' but really got fired because the manager didn't like me...
Nice place to work.
It was a nice job.
"You get good training, but the teller supervisor is the real person that you should confide in as a teller with pretty much everything."
"Asking questions will save your job in a dicey situation, which you get those people who will try and pull a fast one."
this bank is known for there honesty which I liked.
Very Two-Faced.
"People would belittle others, the rules were different for each person in the departments, and there was zero consistency."
"Not a happy, healthy, or fun place to work at all."
Values and Practices.
"Values and practices that align customer needs and satisfaction as primary considerations in all business decisions, and ability to leverage that information in creating customized customer solutions."
Great Bank - Location Dependent.  
this bank is a great bank.
this bank have very smart leaders who have integrity; best of both worlds from the Wall Street banks to the Main St banks.
"Strong culture, strong products, great branch environment."
"If you live outside of the major hubs: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Charlotte, Kalamazoo then there isn't much opportunity for advancement."
"Branches at any bank aren't fun anymore and this bank is no different-bare bones staffing, not very good raises, and unrealistic expectations."
this bank doesn't pay particularly well but this bank are nicer to work for than a lot of other banks.
Poor work/life balance.
"Work 6 days most months, unless you request a Saturday off."
Very micro managed.
They wanna know what you are doing every hour of the day.
No time to focus on personal life.
When you do well and achieve your goals they want more.
depends on what branch and your management.
Overall I believe this bank is very demanding when it comes to goals.
Having works at a location that eventually turned into a 'Business Banking branch' goals doubled and sometimes seemed impossible to achieve.
"Working for this bank was great, I met a lot of great people, most of my co-workers were wonderful, it cam just be a very stressful job."
Productive & fun workplace.  
this bank has always provided me with a good challenge.
I like to keep busy and I like to know that I am doing good work on behalf of customers.
I have been employed with this bank for almost 7 years and have enjoyed every moment.
I have also enjoyed learning new things.
I am currently looking for new employment due to life style changes at home & sadly the hours that I am currently looking to work I can not work at the branch.
"I love my coworkers and my customers, I would recommend others to apply/work at this bank."
Terrible Management.
The job isn't that bad there's just a lot to know and learn but mine feel mine's experience at this bank has been tainted because of a poor manager.
The job can definitely be a high stress job due to the many things that you must look out for and the people you encounter.
"However, the pace, stress level, and atmosphere of the branch depends on the location."
"mine've worked at a branch where they see a hand full of customers for the entire 8 hours and mine've worked in a branch, such as mine, that can be very busy and almost everyone has a problem."
You are expected to provide a very high level of service to customers and you must show up at 110% to work everyday.
A good experience to have and a great resume builder but not for everyone.
Fast paced organization.
"Project was beyond deadline prior to start date, thus making Project stressful."
Project Business PMO was not organized for Project in a fashion that would lend assistance to a Consultant coming in to 'save the day'.
"Great co-workers, very unorganized."
"Co-workers at this bank are a lot of fun to work with, however the management and organization in the call center is terrible."
I have had 3 different team leads (supervisor) within 2 months time.
"People cannot keep the job, and the culture at this bank is toxic."
"Everyone is really stressed out, team leaders are incredibly demanding and sporadic."
You will deal with a lot of difficult and angry customers.
"About 20% of your call load are customers that are willing to yell to get what customers that are willing to yell to get what they want want, and you cannot help customers that are willing to yell to get what they want as much as other banks."
"this bank has a lot of restrictions and policies, hardly any leniency in the call center position."
"Pay is decent, however advancement is very limited for the amount of employees this bank have."
You have to be a superstar to go anywhere.
"Pack a lunch, because there lunch bars are incredibly expensive and close 2 hours into your shift if you work 2nd shift."
productive and fun work place.
A typical day at this bankBank was usually busy but fun at the same time.
"I enjoyed my co workers, management and the customers."
I learned that if you want to move ahead in life you have to work for it.
The hardest part of this bankBank was trying to sell products at the teller windows.
It was possible but time limits you.
Other customers wanted to do Other customers's banking and leave.
I enjoyed it because we would always have snacks and goodies at our windows.
Its a job.
Sales sales sales or how this bank puts it solutions to this bank's customers financial needs.
Be ready to have responses when customers say no and when customers say no a second time be ready to overcome that no too.
Management plays favorites and also does not lead by example.
a job will pay your bills.
If your personality is not liked you will be sure to know
Overwhelminglu stressful.
No support/training from management.
Unwillingness to hear opinions or implement change.
Unfair and unobtainable expectations.
Responsible for multiple department's work and no compensation
N/a. I Don't have an opinion of company.
I do believe that company could improve on the salary as to the amount of work expected of us daily.
I don't have any other complaints
trading spec.
Busy in trading group.
Great place to work .
Have been here 10 years and trading group are good to trading group's employees.
My team is a good group of people who work very hard.
Overall Great Company.  
this bank is a Great company for Job Seekers who have experience in Banking and Technology would be a great asset to this bank.
this bank feels fairly new and does not have solid processes as of yet.
This is ideal with candidates with Senior Experience
I enjoy being a Financial Advisor.
My days consisted of working closely with my bank partners.
One on one coaching around how to recognize an opportunity for a bank client to meet with me for a consultation.
Management was very hands on and supportive and wanted the advisors to be successful.
The hardest part of the job was to keep my bank partners focused and motivated.
"Once I received a qualified referral, I truly enjoyed understanding and learning about a bank client's financial circumstances and needs."
I looked forward to educating clients about different investment products and why what I proposed made the most sense based on clients's individual financial position..
Could be better.
"Work life balance is completely off, salary should be higher as well."
"If you don't want to sell don't do it to yourself, you will get coached until the day you quit."
Bad culture.
Bad culture took a dramatic shift to a sales first organization with little concern for employees or customers.
I understand sales are what keep the doors open but should not come a the expense of the employees or clients
Not a bad entry job.
"not a bad place to start, great training is provided but the pay is super minimal and raises are far and few in between."
"depending on your region, there is great involvement from the higher-ups."
educational place to work.
I managed a branch of 8 employees.
"my goals were set high, I found this job to be rewarding if you made your goals."
in which I did every month.
The bonus are very rewarding also.
Was good when mine started.
Then there were constant management changes and reorgs which caused an atmosphere of fear and confusion.
"mine was in technology and worked a lot with other areas and some were good, but a lot were like mine."
They have some work to do in some markets.. -
Continuous flow of clients made it easy to obtain revenue.
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
It can be the people that you work with. -
The most enjoyable part of a job was seeing how many lives I was able to change for the positive.
I don't mind giving financial help/advice to anyone who is in need.
#NAME?
"Individualistic. - Leadership eluded all confrontation, problems not solved."
Training is a self study nightmare.
"Peers are friendly, management is open to conversations with employees."
I started at this bank and the training program is ineffective.
"Four different facilitators in four weeks, no consistency in work materials and 'the new training system is coming' which doesn't benefit those in a broken training environment."
There is very little practical training on how to use systems and process banking requests.
"Overall it would be just an average 3/5 because they do offer competitive salaries and some pretty decent benefits, but the frustration at dealing with poor training cannot be ignored."
"There are some questionable wage and hour practices as well, requiring employees to be present and logged in and 'caught up' on system process and procedures while not on paid time."
Great place to work.
Take payments from Borrowers and apply to accounts.
Send out letters to Borrower for documents needed.
Called attorney to see if borrower can be put on payment plan and up date attorney on account.
Talked to borrowers to give up date on loan and answer any questions borrowers might have.
Very friendly work enviornment.  
this bank is an amazing company that looks out for this bank's employees.
this bank make sure that we have the right equipment for our jobs and are always looking for feedback from employees to further improve this bank.
The work days can be fast paced based on the clientele for that particular business day.
I've learned a lot from this position that I know I can utilize at other jobs as well.
The hardest part of the job is trying to work fast but accurate.
My coworkers would have to be the best part of the job.
We are all like a family.
it was really nice.
i had a great time this job for this company.
i learned a lot of new things and great work environment.
Overall I would recommend this job to anyone because of the room for growth
As exciting as a bank can be.
"Dailly interaction with customers, driving sales and understanding products."
Very good management process in a very conservative environment.
"While at times pushing products stressed the working environment, facilitating people with people's financial needs provided a satisfying workplace."
Good Company to Work For.
The company Good Company to Work For. is great.
"I do not have a negative thing to say about Good Company to Work For., or my original management team."
My department was split up and I was one of the unfortunate ones to get a green horn manager.
"There was little to no direction given to a green horn manager, a green horn manager made it next to impossible to do We as employees's jobs, a green horn manager got rid of a lot of people to bring passed employees from a green horn manager's old place of employment in, a green horn manager cause 4 long term employees to either quit or get fired."
bottom line....
We as employees were not protected from the new management style and were told to shape to a green horn manager's standard (which was very low) or ship out.
Excellent work/life balance.
Great place to work.
Great co-workers and management team.
Excellent benefit package.
Many bank branches thruout thecounty.
Average career advancement.
Enjoyed it.
I got out of my comfort zone of the restaurant business and enjoyed the challenge of banking hospitality.
the challenge of banking hospitality helped really refine my conflict resolution skills.
Good place to work..  
this bank is a good company with great benefits and offers a very good work life balance.
Great company for a person with a family as there are many options availale to assist.
"They practically through money, but very stressful and not for weak of heart."
"Its a great job to start out with and they allow you to branch out after 6 months of being a standard consultant job, but it just so hard to get through the day sometimes and keep to their expectations with low call times everyday or good quality"
this bank Experience.
Company overall is good but do not pay competitively.
My last manager was the worst I have ever had in my life.
"Unorganized, unprofessional and in experienced."
Good place to learn - hard to advance.
"While this position is a great job to learn different skills I feel as if too many different tasks were given, and there was not enough training on individual products."
"The phrase 'Jack of all trades, master of none' is well suited for this position."
Having a specific area of expertise would be more beneficial for achieving success and meeting goals.
A bit too much being pulled in different directions and not given ample time to fully succeed at sales
Okay Place to Work.
"The folks have been good for the most part, but I'm just looking to change roles."
this bank as a whole has treated me okay.
The whole things is right down the center of the line.
Nothing special.
Good Place.
Could have been better but good place to work my experience wasn't at all the best but the people who work there are great the environment is great and it is a good job that pays decently but not enough for the amount of work you actually do.
Upbeat Call Center.
"I've never done retail banking prior to joining this bank, but I've learned a lot in regards to the products and the the demographics of the customer who use the products."
Avoid at all cost!.
Working for this bank feelt like a punishment.
this bank expect a lot for very little pay.
Branches are run on fumes and this bank expected you to deliver great service and sell.
"Management was ineffective beyond words, too busy creating endless action plans..."
The rot definitely set in from the top.
People were fleeing in droves.
The new recruits had zero bank experience and nobody had time to train The new recruits so loads of errors and bad scores which torpedoed any bonuses.
All around bad.
The culture is toxic.
Customer Service Savvy.
"Providing account services to customers by receiving deposits and loan payments, cashing checks, issuing savings withdrawals, recording night deposits, selling cashiers check/money orders, answering questions related to financial well being and other bank services."
Look somewhere else.
Company was good until Company acquired bank
N. Everything went downhill after that.
The PCG group definitely went downhill along with the payout amounts.
Enjoyable place to work and learn at.
"I enjoy working for this bank, I have been here for over 2 year and I plan on keep it going."
I transfer to a new position which is Project administrator and I really enjoy on what I do.
Productive but non-flexible environment..
The work/life balance was an issue.
Work schedule and remote was not flexible.
Co-Workers were great.
We had a collaborative and challenging work place.
your just a number to them.
Don't expect to make a career out of your position.
They will tell you what the average is for your position but it will take you 4-5 years just to hit the average is for your position
this bank is good if you're passionate about this bank..  
this bank is a very conservative and fair company to work for.
"I very much enjoyed the interactions I had with my other coworkers and the clientele, on most days."
My favorite thing was showing people how to use the alternate forms of banking such as the mobile app or the ATM's.
"My biggest dislike of the job was how much pressure is put on the employees, even the tellers, to push products and services on the clients."
"We had sales goals to meet and we HAD to be asking the clients about credit cards, lines of credit, account upgrades and more, even if we see this client multiple times a week."
"Corporate culture, but a good one."
Job duties and your day to day will differ depending on your department and role in the company.
"Compensation is fair, with available bonuses for high performance values present to help with additional compensation."
"Training is comprehensive in most areas and aspects, with a great company culture."
Well structured breaks and excellent benefits.
Great opportunities for advancement if you have the skills and mindset for customer service and are open to coaching opportunities.
"Flexible scheduling options, and consistent support on the job is available if needed."
productive and fun.
"In the U.S., this bank is the fifth largest bank by number of branch offices, sixth largest by deposits, eighth largest by total assets,[2][3] and fourth largest in number of ATMs."
Good Corporate Workplace.
Solid workplace environment with good work life balance.
Managers genuinely cared about employee career development.
"Not as quick to change as some companies, but a solid place to work."
Great Schedule.
The schedule and location are great.
Management tries to engage employees.
The work is interesting and benfits are good for part-timers.
Enjoyable envrionment
producctive place with a lot of politics.
a typical day requires you to do a specific job function while helping others complete theres. must be done in a timely manor.
management doesn't give new hires the time new hires need for training and just hope that you will catch on quickly.
everything changes almost everyday referring to policy's and procedures.
most of the people are nice and occasionally most of the people feed you lunch
the pay is ok and there is room for growth only if someone retires or leave.
Great place to work and full of advancement.  
this bank is a great place to work.
If you love numbers and dealing with the public in a customer service atmosphere you will love this job.
this bank also offers government holidays paid off.
Good Company.  
"this bank had a small credit card portfolio that this bank managed and tried to grow without success, so this bank sold a small credit card portfolio that they managed and tried to grow without success to MBNA in an attempt to make a profit."
Work environment.
Opening for bank tellers consisted of safety check with another member of staff.
Opening and signing on.
Depositing over night drops to business accounts.
Daily activity of customers transactions.
Helping clients with maintaining clients's accounts.
The hardest part of the job is accuracy.
I loved the daily interaction with the clients.
Wonderful Work Place.
"One of the best places to work for, great pay and workplace culture is very positive and relaxed."
If you enjoy assisting customers then this job is for you.
not the best work place.
They sell you a good dream but as time goes on you start you feel like you were told a few lies.
Management is the biggest problem they all need management classes.
Great Place to work..
Company had grown fast in small amount of time.
"Excellent management, great place to work."
Company was in process of being bought out by Washington Mutual Financial
none.
"I worked for this employer in a number of function, some of a number of function were good, some overly managed."
I left the job to pursue other opportunities..........
Good Job just not for me.
Good job for someone who likes to be inside all of the time..
I quickly learned that I didn't enjoy looking at the same walls all day.
Micro management.
Good place to work.
A good place to work.
Salary is becoming more competitive.
Enjoyed the company and working for the company!
Great core values and worked hard to encourage Great core values.
Would not recommend.
I loved my job when I started with company but with recent manager changes there is a lot of turnover .
"It is a stressful environment , long days with limited staff, the sales aren't bad but you are expected to still meet sales goals when your are just trying to get clients daily needs meet in a timely manner."
It is a VERY stressful environment.
Financial services.
Balancing commercial and private accounts.
Debiting and crediting accounts accordingly.
Providing business and personal services to clients to fit clients's individual needs
Summary.
A lot of room for development but its hard to advance.
Management staff is great but there is not a lot of work life balance with the company.
the company have a lot of options but it is hard to get time off.
Why cant we fix things.
"The Help Desk is so worried about customer service, that we cannot fix things."
Monthly reviews based on our customer service skills.
The Help Desk don't care if anything gets fixed.
Stressful..
They care more about making sales calls like telemarketers then their employees.
When you work in a branch where you have the same customers all the time it is hard to sell the same customers different products.
Or offer the same customers products were the same customers receive perks and then take perks away.
You are told to do things one way by one higher up and then another way by another department.
Its conflicting.
They want you to be 10 people and pay you for 1.
"They don't want to hire more employees but blame you for customer wait time, bad surveys, drop in goals etc."
Review.
VERY poor management!
Company was taken over by this bank & too many changes.
Lack of communications!
Was promised advancement & advancement never happened.
Company made over $4 Billion dollars last year & we all received under a $0.10 cent raise!
have fired people that had been there for over 10-15 years & are now bringing in people at a LOWER pay!
"have people working there that are not working & mangers don't do ANYTHING about it, but, mangers fire, let go of people whom actually work.."
Would NEVER recommend work here!
Overall a good work environment and inclusive.
Production of client pitch books.
miscellaneous graphic design.
project management.
very fast paced.
deadlines.
diversity.
collaboration.
people are great
Very poor management.
The managers at this bank do not know how to manage The managers at this bank's people properly.
The managers at this bank have favorites that can do no wrong.
If The managers at this bank don't like you for any reason The managers at this bank will treat you poorly.
Good Atmosphere.
Peaceful work invironment.
Our manager was nice & approachable.
Sometimes fast paced but nothing overwhelming.
I enjoyed working with & getting to know the customers.
Great Company.
I loved working for this bank.
it was a great experience and I will recommend anyone to work for this bank.
this bank take care of there employees as well as there customers.
It was okay..
"At the branch I worked at, we had busy days and slow days."
"It felt like I was always out of the loop, though."
The girls were each in The girls's own clique.
"The manager seemed to have favorites, though I know The manager isn't there anymore."
"great team to work with, poor benefits and management."
Working here is a good experience in terms of the challenge of the work and the team you work with.
However this bank this bank itself is lacking in reasons to keep you as an employee.
"this bank itself's benefits offered are very weak, the salary is nothing special, and overall the competitive landscape puts this bank itself toward the bottom of major financial institutions,"
Stressful Work Environment.
The last few years were very stressful and the work needed to keep pace with the workload was excessive.
Working until 9 or 10 pm in the office and working at home until 3 am was common.
Not Worth It.
I'd never recommend any position there.
Management is very stressed and Management will pass that stress on to you.
Management wanted to increase employee benefits to encourage people to stay but a lot of people from my branch left for other banks in the short period of time that I was there.
"Stressful, Poor Management, No Room for Advancement."
I started at this bank after talking with a recruiter about advancement opportunities.
I took a lower entry position knowing that I would be completing my MBA in the near future.
The job description is misleading.
You are forced to take trainings and back up for other departments which were not included in your job position.
"No advancement has taken, even though I have over exceeded all company goals in place for my position."
I have place many different applications to different positions over the past 2 years with no avail.
It should be noted that my department has an extremely high turnover rate.
Many employees unsatisfied with the company.
Many complaints within the company from the top down.
"Upper management complains about processes, systems, overall strategy of the company."
"Managers, Bankers and tellers are mostly unsatisfied with Managers, Bankers and tellers's jobs and salary."
part-time job.
"all the time different schedule , schedule only for two weeks , work every other Saturday ,small many, no benefits on part time."
Not regular hours.
"One week 28 hours ,next week 35 hour."
We work as a team and enjoy our perks.
We strive for more..
My typical day at work is basically providing customer care in a professional caring environment.
Every day there is something else that we learn.
We share and exchange ideas in our huddles to achieve more positive results in our work load.
There is no hardest part in my job as situations and questions occurs it is my duty to learn and achieve in a positive way what the needs are.
I grow with each task.
"By doing this, it provides me with an enjoyable feeling of achieving my goals."
The benefits were fine but the work/life balance needed to be improved jpon.
The company as a whole is a great place to to work.
My department lacked growth potential and was experiencing high turn over.
The work load exceeded the staff level.
Not all of it.
From what I've hear my experience with this bank is strictly based on the department I work in.
The lack of organization and communication is astounding.
I am excited to see what the rest of this bank is like.
Great as Entry Level.
Great to get your foot in the door to banking but the salary is lower than competitors.
The bonuses are a tad better but The bonuses are taxed so heavily that it doesn't feel as worth it.
Good place.
Worked here for several years and loved the team I worked with.
the team I worked with are so tight knit as a team.
"I enjoyed this job very much and had we not moved away, would still likely be there"
All in a days work.
"A typical day of work consists of answering phones, originating applications, closing loans and assisting customers with customers's financial needs as well as customers's financial goals."
"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers obtain customers's financial goals, Especially when customers did not think customers were able to."
Good place to work overall.
I've never worked for a company that gives weekends off so that right off the bat is a positive thing for me.
You can't beat bankers hours or all the paid holidays.
"The benefits and days off are great, I think personally that for what they are asking me to do in my position that they are underpaying for what my position requires, but it's a trade off with all the benefits."
A great work life balance is something that I've always wanted in a job and now I have A great work life balance so that is a great thing.
"Displaced after 25 years of service, due to down-sizing as this bank were integrated into a larger group based out of Philadelphia, PA..  this bank is a huge company with grand ideas on employment engagement and work-life balance."
"Having been employed with a bank that was acquired thru merger into this bank, there was constant struggle in communications and creating synergies among the teams."
"Micro-managing was a constant issue with a larger group based out of Philadelphia, PA and leadership was a nightmare with inconsistencies in decision making and collaboration."
this bank.
this bank was a great place to work.
Great entry job.
the hours were great and the pay was nice.
The training was nice.
The people were great to work with.
Great company.
"Not terrible, just not for me."
Underpaid and over worked in my situation.
People were awesome though and the experience taught me a lesson which you have to be grateful for.
"Overall, if you like finance, finance's a good place to start."
"Great place to work, Great team and Great company."
Started with this company after college.
Like almost everything about this company.
I work with a great team and have a great manager.
"Each day is something new, always learning."
Lots of opportunity here.
See lots of familiar faces each day.
Fun branch to work at.
"Typical day was waiting on customers and taking loan application opening accounts, Getting loans was the hardest part getting loans approved."
Worked with tellers to make sure loans balanced and to follow all audit procedures.
Worked with business partners to obtain new business customers.
"Workplace culture was good, enjoyed my co-workers and most enjoyable my customers."
Overall work is ok.  
this bank talks out of both sided of this bank's mouths.
On one hand this bank talk about only doing what is right for the customer and on the other one this bank talk about meeting goals in specific areas.
For example this bank need more credit cards and more credit cards is the focus.
Current regional manager is not diplomatic and talks down to employees.
Does not care about work life balance.
No grace for mistakes or not meeting goals.
bank.
Working for the bank was one of the best jobs I have had.
The customers and my co workers was great and so helpful to me.
THe banking industry is also a great place to work.
Comfortable work enviorment.  
this bank BANK is a great place to work and advance your career.
The salary is way lower what other banks pay but there are opportunities of advancement in reach for all employees.
Comfortable work enviorment and structured very well.
Think twice...
Almost every weekend I was on-call.
NO career advancement within your department.
Management could be better. .
Good Place to Work.
The this bank location in Whitehall is a great place to work.
Business Casual attire.
People want to work but it's not cutthroat.
Management is supportive.
Everyone seems to enjoy being here.
Great place to get your foot in the door of finance.
"If you're starting off this is a good place, but if you have experience I wouldn't recommend it."
"Pay wasn't the best, the health benefits are terrible."
"Unhealthy work environment, but they do give a decent amount of vacation days."
Summary.
I had such high hopes when I started working for this bank.
I was told that this bank really cared about this bank's employees and understood that employees had a life outside of work.
I always tried to go above and beyond for this bank.
I was a part-time teller and was working full-time hours for a month because a teller had left.
I went out of my way to come in whenever this bank needed me to.
Finally I asked a month in advance for a day I needed off and of course this bank did not give a month in advance to me.
Even if you are part-time according to this bank this bank have to be your main priority.
"I tried to reapply and give this bank another shot, but this bank told me I wasn't a match because I told this bank the reason why I left this bank is because I needed to attend a really IMPORTANT family event and was told there is no flexibility in this bank."
"I'm glad I was told that because I don't want to go back to a bank who pretends to care, but only care about a bank who pretends to care, but only care about themselves."
"My advice to any part-time tellers is that it's okay to go above and beyond sometimes, but don't do it all the time if your going to be frustrated if any part-time tellers won't return the favor."
Other than that I really enjoyed this job.
I do still reccomend to people to work here if people have no problem making this job your top priority from friends and family.
Would never this job at another bank because of this one.
Forced sales quotas made this job miserable.
I'm not a sales person and the people I spoke with had no desire to hear a sales pitch when the people I spoke with were just trying to do the people I spoke with's banking.
this bank Finance.
Excellent company to work for.
Watch out for the manager with the high turn over ratio.
Wonderful downtown Pittsburgh location.
Very friendly employees.
Excellent equipment to work with and systems.
Wonderful place to work.
"Great company to work for, only moved on to make more money."
They tried to match but at that time they couldn't.
Corporate called when I left to let me know that I would always be welcome back.
Stressful work environment.
Working as a teller at this bank was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever worked.
"I worked at one of the busiest branches in the Washington, D.C. area."
Management didn't care how the employees felt about certain things and Management were always pushing you to produce with no incentive.
na. 8 hours a day 8-5 Monday through Friday.
60 day training program with a mentor that includes both online courses and classroom.
"quiet, slow pace position."
Try to get into the right branch.
Hard to achieve goals when your branch is in a terrible location.
I worked in an area that was considered a low to moderate income area and people were constantly rejected due to people's credit.
Also customers of the branch were on fixed incomes and weren't eligible for mortgages or any loans due to restrictions so it made it hard to achieve compensation.
Uninspiring environment.
Had to suffer a period of management right sizing the company at branch level.
It didn't take long to figure out that two financial advisors was one too many per branch.
Temporary work.
This is a stressful work environment and they only offer temporary assignments.
Overworked and underpaid is theme at this job.
"During month end which is the last week of every month, work life balance is near impossible."
Room for growth is nonexistent.
Take your time and talent elsewhere.
Productive Call Center.
"Nice benefits, co-workers."
I am currently working here.
"40 hours per week, incentives."
"Plenty of days off and floating holidays, Teledoc system is very helpful."
Enjoyed working with coworkers and helping people..
Provided routine service support to customers who initiated contact with the Customer Care Center.
"routine service support involved questions regarding products, online directions, and customers who initiated contact with the Customer Care Center's accounts."
"Communicated directly with customers, as an internal service partner, to effectively resolve issues, questions, and service requests."
I learned a lot about working with irate customers.
I did well with deescalation of irate customers.
The hardest part of my job was not being able to assist my customer on occasion.
I enjoyed working with my customers.
I loved when I could calm my customers down when my customers were upset.
fun place to work.
I enjoyed the job just wish the salary would have been more.
I would have stayed then.
If anyone applies just understand you in this area of Vrgina can not live on what they pay alone.
Good Work Environment.  
"this bank provided and good, positive work environment with solid management in place."
Employees were respected and credited for a job well done.
Facility and parking were positive.
Lower salaries in the banking industry.
Don't Do It.
If you take this job be prepared to work all the time.
"If you like to go out and enjoy youy weekend, this job is not the job for you."
You will be working pretty much every weekend except one.
Nothing impressive-
Just another Bank.
"Their corporate concept is good, A lot of poor management."
Turnover reflects this-
Turnover is super high in certain departments.
"No work-life balance, although they try to mask No work-life balance."
"Be sure to research any job posted for the actual job function, you may be deceived into a role as any job posted for the actual job function are very 'title friendly'."
"Benefits aren't very good especially if you compare with other private sector companies, You will feel it."
The culture is not very friendly in this area at least.
Very individualistic.
"The work hours are better than retail hours,"
Cut throat.
"Bonuses are paid off of sales for products, while one person may see a product does not fit the clients lifestyle, another will make the sale to profit themselves."
"Not all management agrees with this, but when numbers are concerned, Not all management will be passively aggressive to ensure that you get the sale."
Great place to work!.
Very laid back environment and plenty of opportunity to grow yourself as an authority in sales and finance.
"They have some great tools, resources and trainers that help you at every stage of you career at this bank."
this bank amg.  
this bank has a good work environment and offers good benefits.
"However, this bank's pay is not competitive to other banks or financial institutes."
this bank does not provide acceptable pay increases or bonuses.
great place to work.
"I enjoyed the company alone with staff, mangers and location."
"staff, mangers and location help me acquire an Insurance license to help customer with Annuities and further investments."
Rewards were giving for annual sales pushing new products to clients.
"Fast, competitive."
A typical workday at this bank was sitting in a cubicle for most of the day.
A 15 minute daily team huddle was completed each day.
"I have to say that I did learn a lot regarding management, teamwork and technology while working at this bank."
The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate job related difficulties to upper management.
The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers.
"this bank Consumer Loan Center-if you get the chance, take the job."
"Jobs there are limited...if you get the chance, take the job."
This is primarily clerical & data entry work.
After the loan is made?
that is where you come in.
Somewhat relaxed for a financial institution..  
this bank has a severe management issue.
It is clear that this bank do not really care about the associate experience.
Managers are very click-ish and lack experience.
The building The building itself needs an overhaul.
don't have one.
don't have one am being forced to do this before proceeding to job application.
"seriously, they are making me type more."
"so, once again I don't have anything to say."
I just want to apply for a job in a completely unrelated field.
"I've been out of banking for 4 years, I could care less"
Horrible management without direction..  
this bank managed by fear regardless if you are senior or in a junior position.
"Every week is a different procedure or idea, both of which are useless!"
this bank Treat significant clients as this bank would clients with a hundred dollar checking account!
Good company.
Work is sometimes what you make it.
You your job and go home because that is what you are paid to do.
I personally keep socializing to a bare minimum because I am not a super extroverted individual.
normal banking enviroment.
typical bank-sales and service/maintenance -sales calls-refer to partners-continued training on the computer-management is dependent upon branch-one hour lunches
summary.
A typical day at this bank is average.
this bank help the clients that come in by helping the clients that come in with the clients that come in's financial well being.
this bank make sure that clients have the best financial needs that will better clients's future.
Great Place to Start your Career.
Work Life balance is wonderful at this company!
"The benefits are great and the environment the environment itself is relaxed, dress code is business casual."
Are making strides in improving areas within The benefits
very nice working environment.
the only reason i left was because other banks offer about 4-6 dollars more doing the same things.
The pay is not good there at all.
i would love to work there again if other banks paid other banks's employees a lot better.
Things were always changing.
This is one of the most unorganized companies that I have ever worked for.
Things were always changing.
"Don't get me wrong change is good, but change can become very stressful when things are constantly changing."
For example; our job titles changed.
"Our job duties also changed frequently, but our pay remained the same."
The management team was horrible.
It seemed as if we were the enemy.
I would not recommend anyone to work there.
Productive.
"I work in a retail branch, which has a high customer traffic volume."
I have had the opportunity of handling all aspect of banking because of the traffic volume.
"I have experience in Investments, Mortgages, Personal Loans, Auto Loans, Monet Market Accounts, CDs, etc."
Flexible environment.
You manage your time from your virtual office for this particular role.
ECO System mentality to gain leveraged account management.
this particular role may likely be the best role ECO System offer on the retail segment
Not a dream job.
"don't like the company, no family life working mid shift and working around a grocery store."
not cool.
"This is not something that can be done daily, same customers everyday."
Nothing really changes
Good company.
Jacksonville site is clearly the best.
"We have great managers, but great managers are also underpaid."
So you lose good people to lesser companies because lesser companies pay more.
"Recently losing our site lead was shocking, but we are doing fine."
Id like to see more competitive pay across the board.
Incentives are good if you work hard.
"Friendly co-workers, good place to work."
I enjoyed this job most of the time.
"Any time working with the public can be difficult, but worked with great people."
Usually worked 6 - 8 hours a day.
Worked 3 Saturdays a month.
Work days were very busy and the day went fast.
"great work life balance, not enough pay."
"my current manager is amazing, however the pay just isn't there for the amount of work we're required to do."
"I love that I have the option to work at home, however."
"Small Teams, Good people."
"A comunicative boss, competent co workers who knew their jobs and would go out of their way to help, in mature business that this bank eventually exited."
It was the best of times/
Job summary.
"Environment dedicated to this bank's clients and employees , this bank values this bank's employees work life balance."
this bank has many services and solutions to help Benefit clients financial well being
Strong Brand in Financial Services Industry.  
this bank is a strong financial company with basically fair benefit and compensation packages.
"However, the recent industry wide restructure of retail banking had a significant impact toward limiting opportunities for career advancement in retail banking specifically."
"Company strengths are solid/sustained strong financial status and competitive suite of products that are well supported with marketing research/collateral, tech support, and subject matter product experts."
An enjoyable element of working at this bank is representing a strong and formidable brand in the financial services business.
"this bank has a well thought out 'go to market' strategy and has developed industry vertical specialization primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, professional services and retail."
"As a manager, implementing strategy and being able to help develop effective tactics to do so, was also an enjoyable part of the job."
Learning Lession.
I've learned much about banking operations and have enjoyed making friends of several co-workers.
I've enjoyed working with clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis.
I've learned about clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis's lives and helped make a difference in clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis's financial well-being.
The experience has reinforced my belief that organization and time management are an essential part of any business operations.
"Chaos in a busy environment starts from not being organized, ready to work when the day begins, and keeping track of what must be accomplished by day end."
I have also learned more about what management styles I work with best.
I enjoy working with individuals whom I respect and trust.
I believe in treating people the way that you would be treated and being consistent with adhering to policies & procedures.
"In my almost 2 year tenure, the branch staff has undergone the following turnover: 2 teller supervisors, 2 branch managers, 1 assistant branch manager, 1 private client banker, 2 full time tellers (including myself), & 1 part time teller."
Branch continues to lose business & personal clients on a regular basis and had not made any strides in obtaining new business clients.
No Review.
"The working culture of this bank became stale as the years went by, where the overall mood was flexible but firm too being ridged and stressed."
Employee relationships went from a family based atmosphere to an environment of strangers.
Great company to work for ..... Worked with many wonderful team members.
Very well compensated; as I was one of their top performers for 2 years !
The clients were great !
You meet such a wide variety of people from all walks of life & you learn from such a wide variety of people from all walks of life ..
you take care of such a wide variety of people from all walks of life's financial needs.
Extremely rewarding.
this bank is a good company to work for.
A typical day at this bank was always very productive.
A typical day at this bank was fast paced with deadlines that needed to be met.
I learned to work accurately and well under pressure.
"The management was good, always ensuring employees were trained and knew employees's functions and was always helpful in advancement."
The most difficult part of the job was ensuring proper communication.
I enjoyed balancing accounts the most in the reconciling aspect of my job.
"very unfair, dishonest management."
"If you want to see favoritism on daily basis, constant lying from management, and talked to like you are 3 years old that please join this bank."
Or if you are Polish

Competive fast pace culture.
"Very fast pace sales enviromrnt, leadership skills are a plus, must possess great customer service skills."

Inimical.
Too much of office politics.
"Teller side are very unprofessional, unfriendly & unwelcoming - some younger tellers (have been there over a year or even 2 years) are bullying the newcomers and some have left because of the newcomers."
"The younger tellers can also be very childish, flat out mean, rude, team up (clique) and belittle others, but not all are like that."
"Whereby, the Bankers are very professional, helpful, team players and the Bankers made my time there most enjoyable working."
I learned a lot from the Bankers as the Bankers're more welcoming and supportive.
Management turns a blind eye on some of the behavior.
Good place to work.
Staff in the 6 branches that I oversee are professional and friendly.
Great environment within the branch offices working with my partners branch staff.
Career.
The job is good on team work and help.
Some days are fast paced some days a little slow.
The hardest part would be not getting stressed on a fast paced day.
I would say I enjoy interacting with coworkers.
I learned how to type faster.
I learned how to challenge myself and believe in myself.
easy job for young adults.
My branch was very relaxed and was a younger branch.
It was very easy to be-friend coworkers and the manager understood a younger mindset.
"The customers were positive for the most part and as long as you were careful with your drawer and followed the basic safety measures, the job was easy."
The best.
this place was the best place I was ever employed!
The company in general is great but of course as with any job you will have your certain people in management that aren't good at and that would be the only real downfall to this place.
treading water.
"If you like to see less talented people coming in from outside the company get paid more than you, sign up!"
the company'll pile work on and give you a 1% raise saying there's no money in the budget while the company is making 1 billion a quarter.
Productive great place to work.
"love the work life balance, collaboration,the talent development and the growth opportunity this bank has to offer, location is very close to home couldn't ask for a better place to work"
this bank.  
this bank has a culture of community and development.
this bank treat every employee fairly and provide care for growth.
In my experience I have the pleasure of being trained and promoted numerous times within this bank.
neutral.
Neutral opinion.
Similar to other large companies as far as supporting the mission that is communicated to the street.
"Over the years, Neutral opinion."
has offered plenty of opportunity.
Great Place.
I love it at Pittsburgh National Corporation.
It has great hours.
THey allow for a work and life balance that is unmatched in the banking industry.
They allow for upward mobility also.
fun work place.  
this bank is a place for someone who would like to advance and expand there knowledge.
The workers there are super nice and helpful when you need it.
The environment is very diverse.
this bank is good start.  
this bank is a great start to getting on the right track to understanding how businesses work.
The staff was friendly and always ready to help you when needed.
Productive place to work.
Very professional work environment I learned a lot of things from here that I use in my everyday life.
I would love for everyone who was willing to work here
Fun and fast paced.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
There was plenty of room for advancement.
this bank also provides continual training to stay informed of new procedures and refresh on products and services.
Great people to work with.
The people in my group were great and helpful.
The company as a whole was slow to get things started and even slower to finish the project.
Working from home was a bonus and was nice in cold weather not to have to go outside.
I love banking and my role as teller supervisor.
I learned so much about bank operations and client services.
I enjoyed my role as teller supervisor and fully intended to strive to advance my career in banking with this bank.
If not for the personal issues I had with the management I would recommend my role as teller supervisor to others.
Need help.
"a typical day at work , not too much more sales management need training workplace not good the hardest part do not teach much if it wasn't for my background i would be lost."

"boring, or getting yelled at."
"rude customers, under-staffed."
"managers don't want to take escalations, escalations don't want to take escalations, spanish line never avail always have to use a 3rd party translator, 10 different programs for different transactions, worst is their strictness with phone time --it is ALL that matters, no time for good needed notes/followupwork/aftercallwork"
Leadership lacking and advancement opportunity.
"Don't really know where to start but the company was bank N bank which was later brought out by this bank, this bank decided to change the culture and make the company like Chase Bank ."
"Following the merger completion, the culture completely changed and everything went down the tube."
"Would have loved to stay but this bank also got rid of all the good managers and leaders , demanding more but unwilling to to reflect it with the pay."
Truly disappointed and a frustrating experience.
Good place to work.
Relaxed work enviornment.
Quality and production driven.
Requires a lot of sitting and repetitive tasks.
Clean facility and updated office equipment.
I would recommend this bank.
Too high of expecations.
"Started off a great place to work, after a short period of time you are expected to know or how to figure out everything on your own with no guidance which makes it extremely stressful."
Managers get high bonuses when everyone hits there goals but the workers get very little bonus.
Due to Managers getting a higher bonus Managers expect everyone to reach goal and if you don't your are heavily punished
"Stressful, fast paced environment."
the job was a fast-paced job required to sell checking/savings accounts and also performing teller functions.
I learned to put myself out there and sell to people.
Management was highly concerned with selling and not so much the customer.
Hardest part of the job was having to sell a product to people who were grocery shopping.
The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and benefits.
"Great Benefits, Poor Coworkers."
The training is as minimal as it gets.
"You're thrown to the sharks and coworkers are petty, rude, and disrespectful."
It's insane how many people laugh at coworkers and customers behind coworkers and customers's backs.
"Benefits are amazing - 10 weeks full paid maternity leave with 6 weeks full paid parental leave, and 3 weeks vacation."
Awesome health insurance.
Bonuses are very reasonable.
"Literally if it weren't for the disrespectful atmosphere and utter lack of competent training, this bank would be a great place to work."
Productive.
Great company to work for just not enough room for advancement due to more jobs out of North Carolina!
Some management understanding & great to work with!
Very stressful place to work.  
this bank was an extremely stressful place to work with little to no understanding from the management team.
"Front line workers answering customer calls, inquiries, and complaints were repremanded when not fully satisfying and making the customer happy, even when it was something out of Front line workers answering customer calls, inquiries, and complaints's control."
"Scores for customer surveys were taken very seriously, even on the occasion that it was clear that they representative was calm, attentive, and helpful to the best of they representative's abilities, but the customer was still dissatisfied that the customer's requests were not completed the way the customer wanted and a low score was given."
"Fast paced, very stressful."
Current management very good.
Past management-very much micro managed.
Culture is very competitive-pitting co-workers against co-workers.
Even though we as workers try to work as a team - in order to reach goals there are many times you must work as cut throat.
This makes for very stressful environment.
Once you've worked here for a length of time and reach the middle of the pay band scale it is very difficult to receive decent raises- 2% is considered a good raise.
The longer I work here the further I fall behind in just covering the cost of living.
Competitive.
"Overall, a good place to work but no room to advance."
Management is good and the workplace is relaxing.
"More job opportunities are needed, but hard to come by since parent company is located up North."
Great Place To Learn Banking.  
this bank has rigorously taught me more about banking in all banking in all its meaning's meaning.
I truly appreciate this bank's training and dedication in teaching new individuals to succeed.
Hired for a particular position but a particular position was changed to a demotion..
The Wealth Management Team hired many of us as Banking Advisors with perks to come after 6 months.
Position was changed to a Support Banker with no perks.
Very Hard to Advance Career.
"It is very hard to move up within this bank, not much help in terms of guidance and development from managers."
Education does not play a role in seeking career advancement.
Stressful fact pace environment.
The everyday work life can be stressful depending on the department you are in.
"However, stressful as it may be, this bank is innovative in the way content and help is provided to this bank's employees to ensure its employees receive any help needed to perform to the best of its employees's abilities."
this bank's an OK place to work.
I'm very neutral about this bank as a place to work.
As with all companies it depends on the area you work in.
The call center often gives the wrong information when you call to seek advice which often is at odds with advice from management.
"Information does not always filter down to you so you find out the hard way, that you made a mistake and are held accountable."
"Senior management are too busy sitting in Senior management's ivory towers, making decisions which impact branch staff, without consulting branch staff."
"Senior management also have no idea about what is going on at branch level as Senior management rarely, if at all, visit the branches."
The job culture is extremely conservative & makes it hard to properly assist customers.
I would recommend.  
this bank is a great place to work.
The pay and benefits are excellent.
The only current negative is that our region is working 6 day works weeks and meeting the sales quotas can be stressful.
decent.
it was an alright place to work.
It is very fast pace in some departments in other departments it slow.
I was in college at the time
so it was the best paying job around
Worthwhile experience.
I very much enjoyed my time working at this bank.
I was given plenty of opportunity to grow as an individual.
I learned a great deal that I will carry on with me throughout my life.
Bad Workplace.
Very Unprofessional and health care is bad.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.
Bad overall it will stress you out to work there.
I can't stress enough that all personal there needs hr training.
Toxic work place.
"Avoid it if you can, really bad place to work, especially really bad management culture."
Managers are incompetent and insecure of people that are more knowledgeable than Managers.
Management takes all strategic decisions by Management without consulting the technical team.
job review.
this company was a good company.
Besides the low pay this job is a perfect job for individuals are content doing this job forever.
you have a good chance to travel with this company
Good place to work.
Very good place to work.
Processes HEP files from entry to closing.
Works as a liaison between departments.
Helps clients to understand processes and requirements.
stressful and judgemental.
If your looking to be judged on a daily bases and have everyone on your team see how good or bad your doing this job is great.
Pay is great the people you work with and around are amazing.
this bank is great.
I think this bank is a great company to work for.
The benefits are amazing and it is fairly easy to move ahead.
Management is hit or miss depending or your line of business.
Maintain information related to heavy equipment floorplan lines of credit.
"Responsible for reviewing loan documentation for clients, file UCC's and monitor changes to client status, request/complete subordination requests."
Provide back-up assistance to peers within department for advance request processing for floorplan lines of credit.
Good place to build a career.
Really good benefits and competitive pay as well as many opportunities in and out of branch to advance.
Healthcare is good.
One of the only banks left that offers pension in conjunction.
You are vested in 3 years as well.
definitely do research on your branch.
"I did not remember applying, but they reached out."
I accepted the job.
Salary is not the best but the company is amazing to work for.
"Management selection could definitely be better, but past branch management there are definitely some great leaders."
Branch managers are very unprofessional as far as I've seen thus far and don't seem to work for the customer's best interest and often assistant branch managers (to my experience) pretend to be to busy for everything.
I loved my the job I did as well as the people I worked with..
I loved it here.
"I loved the customers, the atmosphere, and the people I worked with."
It's fast paced and you need to catch on quickly to avoid making substantial errors.
"As long as you're good with money, computers, and customer service it's a great job."
Good Company.
If you get the right manager this place could be lots of fun - overall descent place to work - Great training for new hires.
Always trying to improve this place reputation.
na.  this bank is a good company -for benefits pay is not idea but work environment changes based on branch -higher up is not informed on what is going on with branch
Cares for its employees.
Salary structure needs improvement so do the benefits.
Demanding customers.
Some customers are great to work with and very understanding.
Too many changes ALL the time so management is not effective.
Management and promotions and pay big problems.
Management gets away with everything.
Management are not held accountable for Management actions.
Promotions are based on who you know not what you know and how hard you work.
"Pay, well lets just say if you come from outside the company you will get paid a respectable wage."
If you get a raise or a promotion from within the company don't expect to get the same.
the company has great core values.
The problem is not everybody within the company respect great core values.
THIS CAN BE A VERY UNHAPPY PLACE TO WORK.
It's ok.
"The job is good, just that the hours are very longggg!"
You come in the morning and you do not leave until when it's very dark outside.
The pay is very low too for all the work we do.
Fun Place to learn and grow.
Great place to start and make a long term career.
You are exposed to learning everything and the only limitation is your own self.
"In 6 months extensive exposure to large volume cash handling, ATM, cash vaults."
Company trains well and places confidence in you to handle stressful situations and make decisions.
Was lucky to have really good managers and colleagues
Decent company.
You typical day varies greatly depending on your position there.
"IF you are customer facing, be aware there ARE sales goals for you to meet."
"this bank has been working to make this bank a more competitive company, pay wise, and has been reinvesting in this bank's current employees."
The maternity leave here is GREAT.
Review.
Love the hours monday through friday 8 to 5 with paid holidays and occasional weekends that you would work.
You do get sick days as well and personal days.
good paying job.
"work in customer service so a typical work day is anwersing questions about one's mortgage (escrow, balane, payoff) it can be stresfful constant changes"
Great Benefits but a very obscure career development.
Mostly people employed are of great character.
Management is helpful but also restricted.
Too much information is given at one time and employees are still expected to excel with very little time to grasp the work.
Great job environment.
Loved working there left only to pursue a higher education degree.
My mentor and senior financial advisor was wonderful and helpful and took time to teach me.
Never Work Here..
Currently work here as an application developer.
They simply do not respect your time of home life.
They will work you all kinds of crazy hours.
I have worked many 20 hour days.
Management does not follow this bank's rules and guidelines.
"Management're pretty much given free reign and aren't govern or checked, so basically, you're at the mercy of your manager whether you perform well or not."
Minorities have a harder time getting management positions.
Minorities are overworking Minorities's skilled employees and underworking the people right out of college with no skills.
Very bizarre work environment.
Intensive work place.
Hard place to work for.
As the company grows employee benefits decrease.
Not a work life balance.
the company values new employees more than senior employees.
It's truly unfortunate
recommend.
good opportunity and training was adequate.
communication of expectations and work related changes were timely.
I think it was over-all a decent place to work.
Hard work fair pay.
Hard work fair pay.
No obvious path for advancement.
Work was very demanding but rewarding.
Genuine appreciation was received from managers on all projects.
It was a job.
I loved my branch manager but this bank def doesn't care much for this bank's employees.
this bank seem to always be looking for way to put more work on this bank's employees without compensating accordingly.
"When I was there many people were leaving for other banks and industries because as a bank, this bank are only looking at the bottom line."
Good company.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
"this bank offers amazing benefits, good hours, great coworkers, and a lot more."
"I learned great customer service skills, conducting sales calls, and money management."
I enjoyed being able to learn about the banking industry and travel a lot within the region to help out other branches while meeting a lot of good hard-working people.
Hardest part of the job was adapting to a lot of change from software to new employees/managers every so often.
"Overall, this bank taught me a lot skills and I believe this bank is a great stepping stone that will lead to better opportunities."
Management issues.
In the branch that I worked at it seemed as though you couldn't advance your career.
People wanted to hold you back.
People didn't want to see anyone succeed.
Overall.
The people were very nice.
The working environment was fine.
The pace was non-stop.
"But, working at the call center was not a good fit for my situation."
T
this bank Review.
"I hate call centers, but as far as call centers go, this bank Review is a good one to work for."
I truly feel that this bank Review is a company that cares about this bank Review's workers.
this bank Review are very accommodating for many different life events.
Full Service Retail Bank.  
"Full Service Retail Bank is a great place to work; however, the potential for job advancement is difficult for someone wishing to not work in a customer-facing environment in the Chicago Market."
Great Place to Work.
A typical day at this bank would start off with a short meeting about goals and what the focus is for the day.
You will get the opportunity to learn as much as you can.
Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking.
"My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to an action plan."
That's the best way to succeed.
The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet.
The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with the territory.
The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for the fruits of your labor among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner.
I LOVED working here.
if you can manage stress well and are extremely competitive then the job is great for you.
good company to work for.
"Great organization to work for , management cares for employees and provide good support when needed ."
management was patient and honest lot of work and overtime as needed .
staff consisted o younger generation and older employees which shgw an adequate balance
it was alright.
"not the best not the worst but pay wise not anything to talk about.health benefits also were horrible and commission structure isn't the best, only good t get your foot into the banking industry"
Sales and Service.
Sales and Service is a stressful place to work but can achieve goal with practice and learning.
As I just started working here so it is too early to comment on other aspects.
Relaxing environment.
Mainly just data entry.
It was very relaxed.
"I truly enjoy data entry, especially 10 key and data entry, especially 10 key's mainly what this job was."
Great people that I worked with.
The supervisor wasn't the best and I would have traded The supervisor for anyone else.
Productive and stressful place to work at.
Experience started out great.
"Opportunities for bonuses, but Opportunities for bonuses were very hard, and sometimes unattainable goals to reach."
Started to become very stressful after about the first 6 months.
Job security was questionable.
Very high turn around rate.
Work Life balance wasn't good at all!
Great benefits.
"Learned the value of banking, and managing credit."
this bank review.  
this bank is a great place to work!
"My manager was very supportive in everything, however many times the regional management liked to micro manage!"
It also seemed like the regional management wanted us to work six days a week but still within the 40hrs!
teller.
I have learned a lot about the teller line.
having patiently.
"no overtime, I like overtime for the holidays."
become stressful when balance at the end of the night
Worst place to work as very lacking in management.
I never recommend anyone going to solution architecture group as very poor management and lack of budget forecasting.
Very volatile environment and no proper laying out projects or work load distribution
"Competitive workplace, nowhere to excel."
Tellers would often bicker and get jealous from one another.
A lot of pointless drama no matter what branch you're at.
Turnover is so high that this bank gave the tellers raises but management shows a lack of appreciation for employees because employees come and go.
Pay was decent hours are not flexible because this bank is only open so many hours.
Very strict policy and procedures because you're dealing with money and personal information of the customers.
A lot of pressure to sell and be knowledgeable about products.
Worst culture i have ever workef.
Awful.
Caustic work environment.
Turnover off chart.
No matter which state you work in you will hear the same horror studies.
If you don't mind hearng 50 times a day how bad you suck you will like it here.
I hope you don't mind endless buearocracy.
productive and pleasant atmosphere.
I loved working for this company they work around family and work schedule always room for advancement managers always wiling to help I would still be working but I want to work closer to home
Sales driven and under-staffed.
Most locations are under-staffed and floaters are not sent to necessary branches.
Management rides you about sales goals all while reminding you 'not to push product'.
Very productive environment.
They keep you moving not just mentally.
Detail oriented people need apply.
Sales goals are quite competitive along with others in your district and region.
True team philosophy.
Work Life Balance.
Allows up to one day per week working at home.
The culture is relaxed but daily productivity is needed to make your goals.
Most individuals have been working at this bank for a number of years.
"great start, not as great finish."
"when I started there was extensive training and the thought of helping individuals grow individuals's finances, after a few months it became more about sales and getting production."
"main focus is on pushing, instead of financial wellbeing"
Never Again.
I obviously quit my position at this bank for lack of advanced opportunities that were presented to me.
I was constantly over goal each month.
Not a great place to work.
Good.
"Good place to work in, okay management."
Monday to Saturday.
most holidays off.
The pay is better than any other bank.
good environment.
will learn a lot
A productive and steady work enviornment.
A typical day at work involved a steady flow of calls.
I learned a lot about account handling and opening accounts and how to take more calls in a call center setting than I had before.
great place to work.  
this bank was a great starting place for me in the financial institution industry.
I left my job with this bank for an advancement opportunity within this bank with PFPC Trust Company.
Terrible management.
"Terrible management, they put a lot on with little pay, referral expectations is out of this world, you do something good no praise and soon as you mess up this world has ended, and there just no respect."
Only good thing about being a teller was my fellow colleagues.
Don't get pregnant or have small children.
"If you get pregnant your days are numbered, and depending on what area your branch is in, don't expect diversity."
"I was bullied while pregnant, made to lift heavy things and my lunch was my only break."
overall good.
Working at this bank was enjoyable with the branch personnel.
"Fast paced with an emphasis on sales, rather than customer service for beginning employees."
Great schedule.
no comments.
"good bank, very good training and management , workplace culture good, good learning experiences, very busy branches, bank believes in career advancement for bank's employees."
Stressful work environment.
"They act like they care about the customers, but all they want are sales."
They concentrate on the this bank conversation which centers around clients finances.
The goal of the this bank conversation which centers around clients finances is to get clients to move over clients's investments to this bank or to sell clients a financial service that isn't necessarily needed.
Great place to work.
Great training program.
The work atmosphere is friendly and inviting.
Managers seem genuinely concerned about your performance and agreadvancement.
Opportunities for advancement.
Teller.
Not the best environment very complicated for part-time employees to do other things besides work.
If you are a student make sure to be flexible as part-time employees will not be.
Na.
NA
No sharing information about a company I no longer work for you want me information get in contact with a company I no longer work for by calling local branch or applying onliine.
Many times the situation could be stressful with Customer service..
This bank was located in a poor area in the city.
Twice while I was there This bank was robbed once with gun and the other a bomb threat.
"I enjoyed helping people with people's finances as car loans, mortgages, opening savings and checking accounts and assisting This bank's customers with day to day financial needs."
A great place to work.
Pay is good and people are friendly.
I have learned a lot in all different areas of banking from each department I have worke.
A great place to work.
Pay is good and people are friendly.
I have learned a lot in all different areas of banking from each department I have worked in.
Laid back and Friendly.
"A typical day at work was opening the branch and assisted customer by opening account, performing teller transactions and etc."
I learned how to navigate through a very unstructured guidelines.
It taught me to think outside the box in order to execute completion of projects.
The culture was somewhat laid back.
I would have liked to see more consistency and structure to create a better employee moral.
The most enjoyable part of the job was doing the job the job.
I loved being a teller supervisor and leading my example.
Terrible place to work!!.
"I worked for this bank for 3+ years and the environment is great, but the management is terrible, the expectations are high and unrealistic."
"The pay is terrible as well, and fun fact this bank employees make the same amount as Aldi cashiers (how?)."
Oh and if you quit or get fired all paid vacation time has to be paid back.
The turn over rate for this bank is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact).
So if you don't mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you're willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than this bank is the place for you.
I wouldn't recommend wasting your time.
It's not worth the stress and headache.
Meh.
I worked in a call center in Pittsburgh.
The Good: the company offer competitive pay.
I was making $16.58 or something like that.
The turnover is so bad the company almost have to.
"On that note, you can tell the company is trying really hard to make the company a good place to work, so maybe the company wasn't at the top of the company's game when I left, but the company's heading in a really good direction."
The Bad: You are literally just getting yelled out by customers who can't manage customers who can't manage their money and need someone else to blame's money and need someone else to blame.
What's worse is the company does not care.
Good place to work.
I loved my job but I needed more money
so I took a banking job in suburbs....
Worst move ever.
Money does not trump working for a company you enjoy working for.
Great Place to Work.  
"this bank offers ok benefits, but really benefit in the environment."
I feel that the environment is great for creativity and motivation.
Management creates a collective group effort.
this bank.
I was a branch manager for 5 years.
this bank was a great place to work until this bank had a change in the Regional Manager.
I that reason after 5 years of being this bank's due to a change in the Regional Manager.
If not for that reason i feel i would still be there.
Good Environment.
I enjoyed working for this bank and would recommend it.
"Although the pay was not great for me as a single mom, the pay would be good wage for a second income."
"Great financial services company, poor pay."
"Previous role of WorkPlace Sales Consultant in Dayton, Oh had great management and incentive."
"WorkPlace Sales Consultant in Dayton, Oh changed incentive to poorly focused."
"My last role I took due to relocation to Naples, Florida."
"Poor management, poor and changing to worse compensation"
Uneducated Management.
"If they promote within the people they are promoting are lazy and don't know anything about running a branch, audits, or training people."
Managers put Managers's work off on other people and if something that Managers were supposed to do doesn't get done Managers blame it on the team.
Great.
Great work environment.
Lots of opportunity to grow especially if you put in the hard work and effort.
Senior leadership lets you flourish in a competitive but fun environment
Personal Banker.  
this bank was a great company to work for.
"The attitude was relaxed, the sales goals were minimum and management was friendly."
"Overall, working at this bank was easy and relaxed."
daily work.
I works about 46 hours a week as a part time employee and then I was promoted to a full time employee after work several months do several others job.
I was a back up teller supervisors.
I did that job on a daily basis before being let go.
I feel I was let go because I said something to management about doing some else's job and not be paid for some else's job
As a corporation its a great company to work for.
Its a good company to work for if you are in a right branch.
Higher management is very professional and very supportive.
Higher management do provide good training when candidate starts as a teller.
Friends at work.
The ladies at this bank would always make sure you are doing well and loved to make work a fun yet professional environment.
I would have stayed there long-term if it had not been a short-term contract position.
"Lovely employer and fellow staff, difficult to work as a single income family.. Love my coworkers and the clientele but the income is not enough to sustain myself and children, as a single income household."
There is room for advancement and great benefits.
Great place to work.
I came into banking with no experience and have learned so much in my 2 years here.
I would like to move to the underwriting side of banking but unfortunately that would be relocating to a different state.
"Great benefits, poor communication."
"The company treats The company's employees well as far as benefits and vacation, but The company do not communicate well from the higher executives down to the management teams that you see in branches."
the management teams that you see in branches create extremely unrealistic goals because the management teams that you see in branches are unaware of what it is really like to work in the branches.
Then the management teams that you see in branches are browbeaten for not meeting extremely unrealistic goals and it trickles down to how the management teams that you see in branches treat the management teams that you see in branches's employees.
Nice company to work with. is a good company to work for.
"the company have great benefits, atmosphere, flexibility, work-life balance and the people are friendly."
There are opportunities to move around and potentially upward within the company.
I wish there were more companies like the company around.
"Teller responsibilities are achievable, but skewed.."
"Although there was a 'typical day' expectation, a typical day was rather rare."
Pushing sales and dealing with off-loaded phone calls added great stress to the day's rhythm.
Be sure to keep your personal life absent.
"Diversity is lauded, until Diversity is demonstrated."
this bank prefers robots; and that is what is expected.
Prepare to be bullied - at great length.
"Do not share challenges, as challenges will become obstacles."
"Smile, be polite, and lie: These are the qualities that this bank prefers."
very good place to work.
that job with this bank was a great honor for me.
I really enjoyed working there.
I learned so many new things from that job.
that job was really challenging for me
but I was able to succeed.
Great group of people.
"Typical day at work : Send memos to customers , send checks , key rebates."
Run Exception reporting answer phone calls etc.
The most enjoyable part of my job are the co workers.
A great group of people
Meh.
There's ok room for advancement even though they make you feel like there is.
The company is really uptight and The company say it's for the customer experience but it puts undue stress on employees
"Fast paced halftime, poor management."
the management at the branch I was placed was horrible.
I was never trained in the branch I was placed.
There's no direction or guidance at all.
I learned through trial and error.
"The day moves pretty slow and many tasks aren't that hard but all the inside information, like rules and policies, and branch codes and safety wasn't taught to me and is essential for doing the job."
Which makes my job harder.
Also the hours were terrible for a part time worker
Good place to work.
Good place to work.
Just needed a better pay.
Managers decisions are ethical and practical.
Great place as far as being rewarding.
Managers do value Managers's employees.
Loved my Coworkers.
Bad Management.
Working at this bank probably wouldn't have been as terrible of an experience if there was better management.
My manager claims to care about the feelings and well-being of the other employees but is constantly proving otherwise by My manager's actions.
Good people but poor work life balance.
The people that work for the mortgage company are very good.
Positions in management have poor work/life balance as there is no away from the office.
Technology is not very good so have to compensate with more time to fix systems
this bank.
Great company to start out with and look to advance through out the company.
Clients are great but are probably different in south than Clients are in the north.
Management is a shot in the dark because some are great at their jobs and others need some coaching.
Sales focused.
I enjoyed working here with my customers and employees.
My manager was helpful and there for support as well.
I was recognized often for my work and given the opportunity to move up in the company.
I learned allot from my manager and co managers as well.
I would like to go back if the opportunity arose again for me.
horrible place to work.
This is the most negative place you will ever work.
They care about the money and nothing else.
The pay is very non competitive and they take pride in their extremely high turn over rates.
Community based work place.  
this bank provided opportunities for growth and education within the company.
this bank had several events available to employee involvement in this bank's communities.
this bank also allowed for time off to volunteer in your local community.
this bank great place.  
this bank is a great place to work and has a very good work/life balance when advocating for this bank's employee's.
this bank also offers wonderful benefits and focus on each employee.
this bank.  
this bank is a quality employer to begin a career with.
It may be challenging to receive market compensation commensurate with job titles as you move up in this bank.
Nice place to work.
Worked from home mostly.
Would make phone calls and start entering loan information.
I learned this new computer system that was much easier that others.
this new computer system that was much easier that others was most enjoyable.
Management was extremely helpful.
Management were always there to helf.
This company is very organized.
The hardest/best part of the job was visiting my branches the first time.
Everyone was very helpful.
I was sad to leave but I needed to make more money The most enjoyable part of the job was the few friends that I met there.
underpaid.
management will terminate you from pure jealousy.
long hours and will cut the opportunity of you making overtime just so management can receive large bonuses.
Work hours along with work week Monday through Friday.
The ability to advance my career within the company..
Pleasant atmosphere within the company.
Management was great to work for along with employees.
Offered training courses to expand my knowledge and provide career opportunities.
enjoyable place to work depending on location.
depending on role job can be stressful.
"As with any job it depends on the manager to lead, often managers are a revolving door so company often lacked sufficient or appropriate management."
Low wages and no work life balance..
I worked more then 40 hours a week and did not get paid for it.
My manager did not care about My manager's team and was just overall bad at My manager's job.
My manager was concerned about My manager's own sales.
Productive & high volume position.
Our department recently experienced a change in management.
"Over the past few years under previous management, there were no promotions, non-competitive compensation, bare minimum raises, hardly no work/home life balance and zero appreciation (from upper management)."
These situations have led to low morale and very high employee turnover; Our department have been losing talent to other banks that provide much better compensation.
I can only hope things gets better under new management.-
Typical Day.
Great work life balance.
Learned a lot about loans and how to process.
Workplace culture is average.
Hardest part of the job is the unexpected that happens at work.
Decent Place to work.
A typical day for me was hosting conference calls with the branches that I was supporting.
I routinely traveled to the branches that I was supporting for ongoing training and coaching of the branch teams.
My position was eliminated and the assistance I received to find another job within the bank was not adequate or helpful.
Boring.
The duties were pretty easy.
The people were polite and friendly.
The environment was easy-going.
There was room for advancement.
It was pretty boring working there.
this bank review.  
this bank is a premier employer in the Chicago area.
A very professional operation
and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work here.
I would recommend this bank to job seekers.
Extremely micromanaged.
Heavily micromanaged throughout the day.
"Worked in a 'Universal branch', meaning we did the jobs of both tellers and platform bankers, but were not compensated any more for it."
"Co-workers were great, but the manager did a poor job of preparing me when I first started and you are put into a sink-or-swim environment."
"Benefits were ok, but the pay was extremely lacking compared to what bankers at other banks receive."
"Also, deceptive hiring as deceptive hiring do not tell you about the cold sale calls you will be making."
"Ok job if you have a salesman personality, but would not recommend for most people."
workplace environment.
The work environment was ok and manageable.
I along with fellow coworkers were having problems with how I along with fellow coworkers were managed.
Other than that the workplace was enjoyable.
the hardest part of the job I would say is setting up mortages and car loans.
Terrible place to work and they don't care about their employees.
High turnover rate.
Find any excuse to get rid of you.
Worst company ..
Terrible company to work for.
They don't care about their employees and let you know all the time that you are replaceable.
If your successful its never good enough and if your too successful on your bonuses They find a reason to get rid of you.
Corporate environment.
Very pushy on sales goals and speaking in a corporate way.
Really gave no room for personality.
Were never quite pleased with production.
Could lose job at any moment from any number of mistakes.
Productive and highly impactful.
"Very advanced banking institution with great vision for technology and customer service, product development."
A big national bank with a community focus.
"Fast-Paced, Fun Atmosphere."
I loved my job at this bank.
"The employees I worked with were superior to any other place I had been, and the manager for the branch was truly amazing."
"There was always a push for sales, but it was always a need based sale."
"The incentive system was pretty good, but could definitely be improved, as your largest bonus was at the mercy of every client, which could or could not hurt you."
"Often, any poor reviews were due to circumstance out of your control."
"However, though there were bad interactions, all of the positive interactions made your day great."
"Overall, an enjoyable work atmosphere and a strong company to be with."
Awful.
"Horrible work life balance, management wants to exceed goals on loans yet gets upset if you exceed 40 hours per work (which is required to accomplish goal)."
Someone is always watching you.
You cannot leave your desk for too long without someone asking where you went.
Underwriter.
"Excellent corporate culture, a company with complete integrity."
No wonder a company with complete integrity win awards every year as one of the best places to work.
Excellent benefits and excellent work environment.
Secure Job but promotions are based on who you know or who likes you.
I have always like my job
but it got to a point that I was no given the chance to learn new things or advance..
Regional does and assigns who ever he wants better say who he likes.
Each employee has a sign and a sign is stigmatized and It is really hard to prove yourself otherwise after you have a certain level.
"Love my coworkers , poor management , there is no coaching,"
Work Life Imbalance.
Very typical sales culture of 'what have you done for me lately.'
"Difficulty keeping branches staffed with quality employees, very high turnover rate inside branches made hitting goals tough."
Great people to work with.
My role as a teller was great because I was able to help many households with many households's financial well-being but the pay for my job was not consistent with the quality of work I was putting into my job.
"Although we got quarterly bonuses, my hourly pay was significantly less than other tellers from other companies."
this bank just recently changed this bank's pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service.
I also crossed trained as a customer service associate.
There are opportunities to advance within this bank as long as your willing to move around to different branches.
Fast paced and competitive.
The branch I worked in was pretty slow so I was loaned out to a few of the other branches regularly.
It was always fun meeting new people
but it is an adjustment.
People were very competitive there was always some kind of referral contest at every branch.
My manager was awesome but not all are the same.
Overall it was fun.
"this bank's a great place to work, but...."
I have worked with this bank for 7 years.
I advanced within this bank from an entry level position.
"However, for further advancement, it seems nonexistent."
"The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny."
"The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for."
"The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are."
"All in all, this bank is a great company to work for."
My passion is just leading me elsewhere.
general.
The managers interviewed prospective underwriters based on word of mouth without actually determining if prospective underwriters were a good fit for the position.
Bonus program is difficult to achieve as there is not enough work available.
Great Company to work for.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
this bank really care about this bank's employees and you're not just a number.
The bonuses this bank provide are awesome as well.
Enjoy My Job.
I love my position within this bank but I'm keeping my options open to career advancement and better opportunities.
I just want to see what is available to me.
okay place to work.
the job was very cut throat every man for every man.
every man only looked out for management and treatly the tellers as if every man were secondly when the clients met with us first.
I felt very little working for every man.
great company but too much work load.  
"this bank is a great organization, but senior management is out of touch with the demands and day to day at the branch level."
senior management places more work load on Branch Managers to avoid overtime of other branch staff and have so much reporting requirements that it has created a micromanaged feel of an environment.
this bank.
Very strict with referrals and a tough job for tellers.
"Handling large amounts of cash can be very stressful, and with good management this bank is a good bank to work for."
Branch Manager.
Supervisor of two Branch Offices.
Opening protocol to established every morning for employee and client safety.
everyday operations to be monitored.
making decisions on a manager's level and safeguarding the bank.
good job.
great work from home program.
It could be opened to 5 days.
The management is good but not a lot of room for advancement.
The salary band are good but the raises could be more.
"Fast, Fun, and Friendly Enviiorment."
Multi Cultural environment with a melting pot of knowledge.
Company is well versed in Industry changes and updates and makes insure all employees are up to date as well.
Great Place to work.
Healthy work environment.
Managers were always available to assist or answer questions.
Excellent Benefits and a good salary.
Consistent in providing excellent customer service.
Good starting job.
Worked here out of college.
Good place to start and you will learn a lot about money management.
Can be boring and slow but typically very low stress.
"Good work life balance, you get 15 vacation days off the bat and 10 paid holidays."
Work culture.
I worked at this bank after a recent merger with RBC.
The this bank culture was much different.
Several of the tenured employees from RBC seems to really have trouble with this change.
"Also, PCG was new to Alabama."
There were some growing pains with getting this line of business rolled out successfully.
Challenging.
Could be more room for opportunity and also clearer communication when it comes to how you will be paid.
Also vacation days you really have to take them when they let you based on the allotted time available.
So you cannot use it as you need it.
Great place to work depending on the job and department..  
this bank is a great place to work depending on the department you work in.
Recently they started to focus more on quantity than quality in certain department which lowered the moral among the team often leaving the team stressed.
What I learned.
I learned many good skills at this bank and the banking industry.
The benefits are great.
this bank has taught me more financial responsibility personally and allowed me to advise others on the skills I learned.
Fun environment / great staff.
I worked pretty much 40+ hours a week with a great staff.
The hardet part was staffing issues came into place with openers and closers for the branch I was working at.
I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the customers that came into the branch I was working at.
The hours were steady for each week as well.
Great work place to learn many new skills.
"While working at this bank it was a great learning experience,and many great skills learned."
Great leaning classes to update your skills.
Great management that are willing to work with you.
Young atmosphere.
Terrible work life balance...
Buddy buddy system.
Not what you know its who you know.
They promote from outside instead of inside.
They were hiring team leads from off the street and being trained by the agents
Productive and fast paced environment.
Productive and fast paced environment.
I was active lead teller for 6months.
Very nice coworkers but poor management and always short staff.
Enjoy working with people.
bank environment.
the job as teller was enjoyable the management was lacking.
there was vacation time.
i didn't like how we weren't able to get overtime in the branch.
they forgot to give me my raise for 7 months.
Nice place to work.
The job for me The job for me itself was difficult as to why I'm no longer there.
Some people were very nice and helpful and as any place some were not.
The management was very nice and did try to help.
I learned a little more with computers there.
I ha
checks come in that you had to figure out the problems with and then have the problems with fixed.
I did enjoy some of my time there.
N/a. Hard place for a balance life.
Not a very good connections with other departments.
"Good place to bank, and a good place to get experience."
"the people doing the managing are good, the people doing the managing just following the compliance rules."
Productive and.
"it is a good bank, people are friendly."
Many cohesive meetings.
Budgets are in place to hardworking tellers and other branch staff.
Corporate people are easy to obtain an appointment with.
no the best.
Depending on what region the branch is in depends on how the everyday life will go.
the branch will try to help you build your career.
Not the best when it comes to compensation.
Productive and fun workplace with great benefits.
Working for this bank was one of the most awesome jobs I had ever had.
A typical day at work was fast paced and balanced.
I learned how to balance my work in a timely manor.
Management at this bank were very supportive and helpful.
The most enjoyable part of the day was walking in this bank and seeing all the smiles the representatives had to offer.
"Great Benefits, Poor training."
They get you in with Great Benefits but have poor training in place for new hires and for new systems that are updating.
Very little to no advancement if you have no degree even with knowledge and experience.
Part time teller.
One of the lowest paying banks around.
Part time teller.
is also far behind with technology and leveraging technology to process transactions.
Care Sales Environment.
"Production and goals are what drive growth I understand, but the push and focus on numbers and sales at this bank are by far the worse I have ever experienced in my 9+ years of working."
I have been in banking for 6 of my 9+ years of working and this bank is horrible with the pressure.
Every single day is littered with emails and conference calls about NUMBER NUMBERS NUMBERS.
Your inbox will be cleared the day before and the next day you come in you see 100+ emails with every single branch flaunting about one account here one credit card there.
this bank are literally coming in everyday to scam people into banking products PERIOD.
this bank are forced to act as used car salesmen on a daily basis.
Bonuses aren't even worth the effort and nearly impossible to hit Bonuses
revenue oriented.
the company seem to lose sight of the company's employees and are too focused on just making revenue.
Frequent late hours with little notification.
Seems to be a lot of bullying and favoritism within the company which doesn't allow for qualified employees to advance qualified employees's careers.
Never know what to expect.
I was hired in July of 2016 and on January 12th of 2017 we were all informed via a phone call that they were eliminating the Financial Specialist program as of April 21st.
Poor planning.
Poor management.
They don't know what they want or are doing.
I worked with a base salary plus commission
Terrible Pay for Tellers.
This bank should be ashamed of what This bank pay This bank's Tellers.
Tellers work with money and that is the most important thing in This bank besides the customers.
And Tellers work with the customers so that makes Tellers work with the two most important things in a bank and Tellers only get paid $9.82 an hour.
That's awful!
Training is good.
Management was out of touch.
Very stressful with meeting goals.
Management hold you accountable for variables out of your control.
Call nights and staying late
Very competitive.
Very focused on sales.
Lots of coference calls about what you are doing wrong not right.
Lots of good people work there and help make the job a lot better.
decent place to work.
1 decent place to work.
good benefits.
has a pension plan.
two types of 401k and can participate in two types of 401k.
"if not in a major city or willing to relocate, promotions are difficult to obtain"
Check Encoder.
Encode the checks and deposits and check for balancing if needed.
Always willing to help others when needed.
Offered to help in other areas when needed.
Producttive and fun place to work.  
this bank provides employees the room to grow and advance and bring your own personality to work as long as your own personality coincides with employees's customer service requirements.
A place where you can call home and stay for a long time.
Typical bank.
Nothing new.
Its a bank job and can be a good place to hone your customer service skills.
No flexibility on hours and you don't get the best pay.
Still ok place to work.
The hardest part of the job.
The hardest part of the job is the on-the-job training experience for handling the sales and service sides of a branch store.
You attend 3-5 day training workshops periodically to learn all about sales.
"However, there is not much preparation for handling scenarios in which you would need to provide services to customers."
game room nice office.
A typical day would be answering incoming calls from customers about there banking account working there I have learned to do different things all at one time the management there is great the management there are very caring and understanding the hardest part of the job to me is having to explain to customers where customers may have went wrong on there banking account but the best thing about the job is getting to know customer that you never meat before and getting to know customer that you never meat before from just a conversation
stressful.
the company is all about sales.
"Your life doesn't matter there is no support for new hires, employees are rude and not helpful, management doesn't care."
unless you go in with prior this bank experience you are pretty much set up for failure.
Fun to work.
I have enjoyed working there and the place that I worked that I learned a lot about this and their management was good.
Sometimes I get under pressure and I managed to get by the deadlines.
this bank is the most underhanded company to work for.
"Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for the job of two to three other employees."
"this bank does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset overtime on your paycheck over time."
this bank lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits certain people.
Management is an absolute joke.
"If you ever try to leave this bank, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, your coworkers and regional managers will try everything in your coworkers and regional managers's power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if your coworkers and regional managers can help it."
I know from personal experience.
"Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet sales goals, this bank won't fire you for not meeting sales goals, but this bank WILL fire you for not doing your 'job'."
"The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if this bank is not careful, this bank will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has."
I would never recommend this bank to ANYONE.
Long hours no management support.  
this bank is the only bank I have ever worked for that did not require dual control to open or close the branch.
Often times you were there by yourself all day.
Work life Balance.
Work life Balance is not balanced to well.
The majority of my weekends I would often find myself having to put my family to the side to satisfy this bank and any additional free time / family time
i would have to commit to this bank related activities.
a lot required for little return.
As a bssa you are required to exceed sales and have many goals which aren't reasonable based on your branch.
Pay is low for the load work you take....
Great place to work.
I really like my job I came with no banking experience but the training is very helpful I was able to earn a promotion in less than 6 months off being hired.
They have a rule that you keep each position 1 year unless you have a written recommendation from your manager.
My coworkers are great and very helpful and supportive.
I have met several people who worked for the company who are either retired or quit that told me to stay my job's a great place to work.
Great benefits but poor management.
Upper management has been degrading the quality and compansation of the job.
Difficult to move up and raise are less than 1 percent.
Bonus have difficult to come by and over the past 3 years have halved in the amount Bonus pay out while manage have denied that manage have.
Grea work environment.
"Recommend - friendly atmosphere, good work/life balance, tuition reimbursement, ability to develop career path and develop additional skills."
Pleasant place to work!
"Rocky start, terribble management."
The training process was lengthy and frustrating.
"You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved your reimbersments in a timely manner."
"Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees."
There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts.
She would come and go for hours as she pleased.
We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff.
"There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue."
I personally felt demeaned and pushed aside by the branch manager.
Good full time job while in college.
"While in college, Good full time job was an ideal job."
The flexible scheduling mixed with the busy workplace was productive.
"However, despite popular belief, Good full time job is predominantly sales."
Goals are set high and are difficult to meet unless you really know how to talk.
"You have to be willing to learn, as the coaching is there."
I would only recommend to those who are willing to learn to strategically sell - and you must be a people person.
this bank - Good place to work.
"Very Challenging, motivating, and been blessed to work with great people."
"this bank is in growth market and looking to grow, so activities and sales are demanding."
Good and diverse culture.
nice office to work in.
I had a great supervisor and fantastic clients.
I was only Peak Time so my hours were few and after 41/2 years I found a Full Time job with full benefits.
its a job.
Its a good place to work at if your good at making sales.
I'm not a sale person
so this is not the best fit for me.
Customer service I'm good with its just a matter of being nice to ppl.
Westfield is the worst place to be a teller just fyi.
this bank.
the job was very faced paced learned a lot about cross selling and how to sell to people doing people doing their grocery shopping's grocery shopping and having to compete with a tradition branch that is in the same shopping center
review.
all of these companies to the forefront can need more work with communication with executive that pushing a none realistic deaf tone bar and from experience more work with communication with executive that pushing a none realistic deaf tone bar does not make the work place a great place to be around
management.
Not very impressed with management or how management treat there employees.
well over worked and not paid fairly.
when reported to upper management nothing gets done!
Typical collections shop.
This is a decent place to work.
There is a cafeteria on site.
They have a lot of extra activities and giveaways.
it is a typical collections shop.
They try to create an open environment.
It was cool.
wasn't a horrible experience.
Just a bit based off of favoritism in the call center in regards to advancement.
"Also, it is really stressful, you literally take your day home with you."
this bank excellent company.
what ive learned from this bank is how to respect others and others's opinions.
this bank diverse work place and was fair to all the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the demand of work.
crazy day and crazy night.
Inbound and outbound calls to customers to verify credit an debit card activity.
fast paced with the hardest part being that a customer don't understand the process.
Hep. Closed loans for Home Equity products.
Worked with loan officers and underwriters throughout the process.
Very fast paced position and very challenging
Decent place to work.
Management and compensation could improve within this company.
The work life balance isn't too bad except during this company's busy season when this company work 6-7 days a week.
Stressful!!.
I literally had panic attacks every morning before I walked into work.
They want you to SELL SELL SELL!
"It did not matter that there weren't any opportunities to sell a credit card, mortgage or etc."
They practically harassed me every day about sales.
I miss my customers SO MUCH that was the only perk of working there.
The 'raise' was an insult.
Very competitive.
I really like the people there.
I worked in a call center where I met a lot of cool people.
a call center where I met a lot of cool people was a very competitive environment because there was big bonuses given every month.
great place to work.
I was with this bank for over 5 years and still would be if family issue didn't force me to relocate to another state.
this bank made it very easy to advance and provided great benefits including generous paid time off.
Efficient workplace..
"this bank's a great place to work because of the interaction and there are great employees that care about the job and most importantly, the customer."
this bank has a great staff and continues to grow more than any other bank.
Excellent.
I think the over all company is great and the people are even better.
Their was plenty room for advancement.
The knowledge was vary helpful for my position and role I was placed to do.
teller.
"I like the hours that I was working Monday to Friday 9-5. very professional, office was nice environment, I was able to work in other branches learning more"
"Lack of communication, poor management and no sense of direction.."
This place is a sink or swim type of job.
There is NO training that actually teaches anyone how to do their job.
"Because everything is so numbers driven, co-workers can't/won't make time to help new people out, and those who do are punished with poor performance ratings."
Suggestions for improvement are ignored.
Upper management is too busy having meetings about the meetings Upper management have to actually take time to talk to Upper management's 'minions' to find out what is happening in the office and how their 'minions' can help make the workplace a better environment.
"Quarterly financials talk about how much the bank is making, but at year end review they can't afford to give their employees raises."
Employees feel like Employees are just numbers and not truly appreciated.
The occasional lunch and snacks do not make up for all of the negativity in the division.
Great Environment.
"I was only a part time teller, needed full time work."
The atmosphere was great and I loved my co-workers.
I would not have left if it was a full time position
the people at this company are fun to work with.
okay place to work.
this company has room for advancement but make it very hard to do.
the people at this company made it fun to work for this company.
I learned a lot from my supervisor and manager.
Low starting wage.
Hiring freeze created more work for employees who remained.
Nice work culture.
Decrease in monthly bonus opportunity.
Monthly bonus incentive was based on the entire team's performance.
fun.
typical day at work was very busy.
i was pulled to different departments to assist.
management was very nice.
workplace was like a family.
there was no hard part of the job.
the most enjoyable was with coworkers we were a great team
customer engagement activities.
everyday banking operations.
risk management.
customer engagement with activities to draw their attention to bank's products ad how to improve their financial well-being
Great Company.

The management is great The management work with the work/life balance concept well.
Great benefits and the hours are great!

Very fast-paced environment which requires a very tolerable personality.
Overall not bad but compensation could be higher
Ok place.
"Consistent work place, chances to advance."

Does require some weekends and nights.
Somewhat micromanaged.
Overall good place to work.
nice place to work with good work/life balance.

"in charge of opening and closing branch, learned a lot about the financial industry, coming into the financial industry completely new; the management was very patient and willing to teach everything to me."
I am very grateful.
8 out of 10.  
this bank is a good place to work with very generous benefits.
A typical day at work would consist of working a couple of loans.
The most difficult part of the job is when production is down....makes for along day.
My current manager works with me and is very understanding.
I get along with my co-workers
this bank.  
this bank is a good place to work but the pay is bad.
"Beyond that the benefits are good, the management is good, and the Job Work/Life Balance is alright."
Good place that rewards long-term commitment.
You'll get skills here and have opportunities to add value in your position as a BSA.
New opportunities popping up as the company moves to Agile/Scrum for PM and software development.
"Hard to get ahead - the company'll give you a title, but a title doesn't come with much of a commensurate raise in salary."
But the company's stable - the company - and people tend to stick around overall.
The benefits are above average.
Poor Management.
"Not a horrible company, just very bad management."
"Worked in several branches and not all of several branches were bad, but my home branch was horrible."
They pick and choose when they want to follow to the rules when its convenient for them.
Great place to work.
"I come in and pick up my mail, sort my mail and put my mail on sharepoint."
I have learned different functions and different areas of the bank.
We receive quality coaching.
Teamwork and always serving the customer.
"Stressful, super micro managed environment."
"Management is right on top of your every move, documented reasons for why decisions are made."
daily phone conferences more of who wants to know progress than actually out making progress.
"direct manager team calls skip level manager team calls, daily, sometimes twice a day."
Horrible place to work and would never recommend anyone from my industry to work there.
Fast paced.
"For the most part, it was enjoyable working at this bank."
The people I worked with & the customers were great.
The only reason I left was for a better opportunity.
Professional Work Setting.  
this bank has been a wonderful place to start my career.
"In a short time I was able to learn, grow and move up in this bank."
There are many opportunities for growth and to develop your career.
Great place to work.  
this bank was great place to work.
Employees are always given the opportunity to learn and grow with the company.
I had a fantastic experience with this bank.
The continued training and knowledge to expand in your role was always at your fingertips.
the company was committed to making sure each employee had the tools and resources each employee needed to be the best each employee could be in each employee's role.
Management changed often.
You never knew from one month to the next what the strategy was and can only be described as a series of 'charge' and then 'retreat commands'.
Working hours were rough because the branches were never fully staffed and we were constantly measured against Gallup polls that we could never do well on due to staffing.
"Also we were measured against goals that did not take into account staffing, market changes, and dishonest employees."
"fun, stressful."
I worked at the bank in the trust department for years then went into operations department which dealt with the day to day duties.
I posted the daily transactions.
Great place for family oriented.
Really good on separating work from home life.
3 weeks paid vacation with additional week you can purchase.
Also offer 4 weeks paid maternity leave for fathers.
Will never work in banking again.
One of the worse experiences in my life.
Very toxic environment.
Mentally and physically exhausted.
Robbed four times.
Only one raise during whole time there.
Management didn't have your back at all.
Great Place to Work.  
this bank is a great place to work.
The job is simple and fast paced.
this bank are very strict with monthly referrals and if monthly referrals are not met you are required to stay after work to complete.
Good Company.

great people fast paced.
very large sometimes very difficult to get cross functional collaboration.

lots of community volunteer work available
Bank on it.
Working in the corporate office for the Spanish language team was definitely a great time.
Great people and work environment.
Enjoyed my time there.
"Could definitely do with a higher starting wage, but a great job for someone who doesn't want to be a teller but still wants to have the ability to grow within a financial company."
very nice place to work.
It was well managed and atmosphere was good.
wish I would have stayed and looked for more advancement in jobs.
Management was good and was fair.
I would go back in a hearbeat.
Competitive Company.
Great company that is always evolving to stay ahead of the competition.
Clients constantly state that this bank delivers an experience unlike any other financial institutions.
"GReat workers, terrible regional sales managers."
Sales pressure from regional managers.regional managers will make sure to trigger a sale out of you no matter if what the proper guidelines when applying for a product for the customer.
It's okay.
It's okay.
The culture was real cliquey.
The culture was laid back and fun.
Turn over would be high because it was hard to advance into other departments.
"I had good times, but bad times too."
Easy work that require attention to detail.
Probably one of the best ways to make good money if you are willing to put in the time.
Biggest skill required is willing to follow instructions.
Processing or keying for a full work day.
Mortgage Finance HQ ILLINOIS.
"Headquartered out of Warrenville, IL it was beautiful to have the entire team with main office based out of Pittsburgh, PA."
There was no room within Illinois to move up.
Could be better.
"The company preaches customer service first which is great; Employees were taught to take a care of the customers, and most did, but I feel that The company could have done a better job of taking care of the employees."
The pay is very low compared to most retail banking companies so sales associates try to make up for the compensation through commission.
"However, The company is doing more and more to push customers to bank on customers's own as opposed to in the branch, which in turn makes it more difficult for employees to hit the sales numbers in order to earn a decent commission."
"The company is constantly looking for employees--that's good for some, bad for others."
Fun place to work at.
I loved working at the State and Huron branch.
The management was great and fair and the work environment was fast paced.
I would love to go back and work for this company.
this bank.
I loved worked at this bank and had many roles while there.
great opportunity to grow.
I had my first management role at this job.
they supported their workers and I would not have left except for the layoff.
"Made some wonderful, long term relationships."
"Typical day involved reporting, communicating with team members, assembling information and presenting to senior management along with explanations to variances as applicable."
Fast Pace Stressful.
It is a good job for people who work hard.
Can be stressful and some managers are better than others.
If you don't put in the work you wont make much.
Good Company.
good company to work for.
room for advancement.
good environment.
Flexible with good benefits.
training is very thorough and effective.
obtainable goals.
Not for me.
Not enough money for all the work they pile on you and management is terrible no room for advancement favoritism no variety same work everyday negative work environment
Business Development.
Built a portfolio of nonprofit organizations with foundations and investment management accounts for financial management within one of the country's more respected banking institutions was rewarding.
Stressful.
Very stressful job
", regional manager requires us to force sales upon customers daily, always short staffed, huge turn over because people don't want to work in the stress."
Great Culture.
Great place to work with great tools and an opportunity for advancement if you work hard as long as you have a good manager.
They are making great advances with technology.
Productive and fun workplace.
Working at this bank Health Benefit Department processing health benefit was a job love doing it gave me benefit to learning how hospital claims that need to process into the Anydoc System.
"It gave me the opporunity to learn medical codes , we had to process so many claims within the hour , with out many errors , Workplace was ok you had your owe cubical that was personal space , communcation with employee and supervisor was not the best .every so often they change work status never a consistency ,The most enjoyable part of job is learning new job functions and very quit enviroment."
Okay.
"Typical corporate setting, including cubicles and offices."
Good entry-level position with opportunity for advancement.
Work culture can vary dependind on the team.
Highly Completitive.
"Organization is in flux, due to a number of reorganization and cost cutting measures."
"Thus, workers are trying to figure out the new structure and goals."
"As such, people are 'looking over people's shoulders' and not focusing on conduct business."
Review.  
"this bank was an overall good experience, however i did not like the commission structure and felt i can make more money elsewhere with my work ethic."
Compensation was worth the amount of work
this bank is okay.  
this bank is a great company.
this bank's pay depends on how this bank feel when you enter.
I came in requesting a certain amount and come to find out a teller was given a higher salary than me.
Mind you I had experience and management experience under my belt.
The hardest thing would have to be the different policies and procedures everyday.
One person says one thing and the next a different.
Nothing is set in stone so it puts you at risk.
I love working here because it is fast paced.
this bank do recognize you but not as much as you would like.
I love my clients at work.
Na.
It's a good company to work for however the hours in the department makes it's difficult to balance your personal life.
Some weeks are 8 day straight without a break.
Nice place to work.  
this bank is a fast paced financial institution.
Work life balance is ok.
Management seems to care and will help you to advance in this bank.
Goals were attainable and you are rewarded for reaching your sales goals.
riview.
Good working place and nice environment.
Encouraging management and staff.
Overall job security and liberal in paid leaves and working hours.
I suggest its a nice company.
mixed feelings.
it's a great place to work.
"i feel respected, and the management (overall) is great, but the benefits suck."
the management do not want to pay people what people're worth.
"if you get an 'exceeds expectations' rating on your review, you MAYBE get a 1% raise.... if you're lucky."
Can be a stressful nightmare.
A typical day begins short staffed with MANY client complaints coming from neighboring branches.
Branches don't work uniformly as company policy dictates and creates chaos.
Computer and printing equipment constantly fails in the middle of account maintenance.
HR is difficult to reach or deal with.
"Management is ok, ish."
My personal manager is great but at times you can find no one to go to if someone has an issue above your pay grade.
"Security is good, if you have a trainable team."
"Biggest upside is vacation time, however work life balance is difficult otherwise."
Typically day begins at 8:00am and many days we stay until at least 6:30pm.
"Sometimes we get a 30 minute break, a lot of times a 30 minute break's disrupted with a client issue."
Many co workers are unmotivated and require daily training.
Awesome company to work for.  
this bank is awesome !
"Pension, 401k, Stocks etc."
Pay increase as long as you do your job veryyyy well and take care of your customers.
"If you like numbers, you should apply to this bank."
stressful.
worst place to work stressful environment not worth the headache management is horrible nobody knows their job horrible training does not care about employees number driven
great work culture.
Working with this bank I was encouraged to learn as much as possible.
this bank cultivate talent and as long as you qualify and are a motivated person who is willing to move in different positions this bank will train and encourage you to move forward.
Work days typical start at 8:30 and end at 5:15 unless for extenuating circumstances.
upper management is good minimal micro management.
hardest part of the job would be the customers at times and the employees on other occasions.
I Assisted clients with achieving clients's financial goals or coming up with a plan of action to get to their financial goals.
"Maintaining the internal goals for the branch and the individuals is high priority, rallying the team is a must and keeping everyone motivated is key"
overall.
great place to work not paid enough.
"I enjoyed working with the team, everyone was friendly."
management was understanding when came down to my hard pregnancy.
Great Entry Level Job.
I enjoyed my time there.
I had a great flexible boss-that always helps.
"I had to relocate due to my husband's job, but I would have stayed a while."
Great place that will advance you.
Diverse company with great teams of people getting the job done.  
this bank is a wonderful company.
The pros of working there are great people and you have a greater than average chance to advance.
"The cons are just like every other company, some people are easier to work with than others and some of the practices need to change."
Worked as a consultant so I cannot answer this.
NA I worked as a consultant and do not have an opinion My time there was fine.
I was treated well and enjoyed the people on the team I worked with and the people at the site I worked at were friendly.
Above Average.
the internship was a Good internship experience.
The work life balance was great and the people were very understanding of any issues you had.
The pay for the internship was also very good
Productive.
"Management was fantastic, training was informative."
Hours worked around your schedule.
Opportunity for advancement was significant and available.
Benefits were great.
this bank.
Management does not support Management's employees to keep producing for the team.
There are income gaps and lack of stretch opportunities offered to employees.
Overall Great Place to Work.
Overall a great place to work.
Great people.
"Depending on your role, the environment can be fast-paced and can make you feel pressured at times."
Work-Life balance is great with very good benefits especially Paid time off policies.
You can tell the company values the company's people.
fast paced and productive work place with little down time.
"a typical day is a busy day at this bank, your schedule should be full from start to finish."
A lot of sales to be had which you get paid on quarterly.
"Friendly work environment, room for growth"
ok.
Good place to work and good balance with family life.
The pay is decent and the management group is awesome.
I would love to work here again if a position opens.
A day at this bank.
"As a Teller you are totally underpaid for the amount of work you do, while waiting on customers and putting your life on the line."
Don't settle for the low rate of pay.
the low rate of pay's not worth it.
Working at this bank.
Working at this bank isn't so bad.
Working a typical 8 hour day and 5 days a week is great.
Also the benefits are amazing!
The only thing is if you like tracking and getting micro managed by upper management then you should go for it.
"Other than that, helping out the customers can be very rewarding not only for yourself but also for your paycheck."
"Quite honestly, I don't have to much to say that would be negative to work at the branch level."
I enjoyed my time at this bank.
"Great company; needs structural management review, My first manager was wonderful; but My first manager left in my first week for another bank."
The area manager took over....
The area manager offered no encouragement....that was a real lost opportunity
Management is Horrible.
"If I could give management less than a 1 Star, I would!"
I have never had a manager treat me so poorly and unfair as this place did.
"When I turned in my two weeks notice that I was leaving- the Branch manager told me I was making a mistake, judged the financial institution I was going to be working at, and proceeded to inform me how I should handle my finances and what I need to spend my money on."
"When I started at this place , this place had 4 employees (including the branch manger, assistant manager and loan officer.)"
"During my short amount of time at this place this place lost and rehired 4 employees (including the branch manger, assistant manager and loan officer twice (aside from the branch manger.)"
"Work somewhere else, anywhere else...."
Decent.
Not the worst place to be but definitely not ideal.
Lots of selling and operational work but a very drab environment.
Not advanced yet and not high energy either.
Productive Day.
Great customers make Productive Day go by fast.
There are days that it is very busy in the branch that I work in and then there are days that there are no customers.
Working enjoyable.
It is a competitive place to work.
Sometime there was a lot to juggle and to do on certain days and others not much excitement.
I enjoyed working with the customers and co workers.
It was a lot of knowledge to learn at first but then became an easy update here and there for training.
It is a great place to work and advance.
It's okay.
Pay is decent considering you really aren't doing much work.
If you can do the same thing all day every day - count other peoples money and try to sell other peoples services without gaining a sales record - its for you.
"this bank, Consumer Loan Center."
"I took calls and payments from people who had loans with this bank, Consumer Loan Center."
fast paced environment.
worst part was the angry clients who got transferred around.
there was a hugh amout of turnover
Policy and procedures.
Policy and procedure driven.
Company does provide training to ensure compliance.
A system is in place to ensure training is completed.
HR systems are user friendly.
I had Great Experiences.
I Loved every single manager I has at this bank.
But this bank is a corporation so you have to keep that in mind.
"Lots of lays offs, no advancements."
You went no where really fast there I was board with my job and felt I had learned all I could learn.
I do not want to max out at 60k after putting in 30 years.
That just was not for me.
"Some love it , but I needed more."
"Great benefits and management, and this bank."
But just not for me
The company stock was sold and company folded.
I enjoyed working for this part of this bank as i worked with loan officers within company.
I also helped the reverse mortgage team as well with many aspects.
I was disappointed when company was sold as there wasn't a position for me to take.
"sweat shop, no care for the employee."
The company lacked training and had very few managers that knew the products well enough to assist.
The company pushed a very heavy work load on The company's employees.
The goals were very out of reach that very few people reached The goals.
The company kept increasing the hours.
The company would have us go in on Saturday too to work more and during the winter The company shut of the heat.
"It got to the point where The company were having The company's employees push in a code every time their employees left their employees's desk such as making a copy, faxing, taking a loan to a manager, taking a file to u/w etc."
It was crazy.
The company also wanted us to call our customer every day if we had an update or not.
It got to the point our underwriters were to work 10 hours then take our underwriters's computers home to work and also work the weekends.
our underwriters eventually got up in droves and left 20 at a time.
We had no one to underwriter our files and we were still held accountable for closing a loan.
It made no sense.
Engaging place to work.
"Very active culture, looking for ways to improve things, Very active culture, looking for ways to improve things is just slow because it's a large bank."
"They do confront challenges when necessary, and people are willing to discuss issues openly."
Nice work place to work at.
It was overall a nice place to work at if your into saying to someone
No all the time.
Its nothing wrong with that at all you have to sturn and really just understand the job material.
hard work but many opportunities to move around.
Good place to work ok benefits.
Make sure you negotiate well when coming in hard to get a raise.
Many opportunities to move around and a lot of EBERGS to get involved with.
mundane.
"work was boring, training was minimal, boring atmosphere, good co workers, good hours, pto was nice, nothing exciting, benefits were good, little advancement"
Fun place but no career advancement option.
It's nice to work there and great team work but healthcare options sucks.
5000 deductible and then pay is way low that any other sector.
"having good education does not benefit you, high school graduate get same as MBA there."
questionable career move.
Very slow pace environment with high pressure to produce sales.
Expectations are high with limited resources and equipment that does not work.
Also a lot of training irrelevant to job functions.
I loved it!.
I loved every minute of working at this bank.
My teller supervisor was the best and kept me happy in my position.
My team was truly exceptional-My team supported each other every day.
"My team learned together and when one of My team couldn't quite get it, another teammate was there to educate."
Training for me was pretty good-no complaints there.
The hardest part of my position was learning the ATM and the easiest part was coming to work every day.
It's employment..
Artificially stressful work environment.
Weird corporate culture.
After orientation it's all downhill from there.
There really isn't much to say besides that.
Great company if you work in the right area.
Worked for this bank in 2 different markets.
The experience was night and day.
"In one area, there was an excellent support and development network and plenty of opportunity to move into different areas of this bank depending on individual skills and preferences."
"There was at minimum weekly interaction with specialty team members that handled investments, mortgages, wealth management, etc. to assist in serving the client's needs and identifying clients who would benefit from a targeted conversation with a specialist."
It was possible to develop mutually beneficial relationships with the team members assigned to your branch and effectively meet client needs and generate revenue for this bank.
"In the other area, there was little to no support from senior leadership, inexperienced management in the branches, lack of clear communication, and no plans for expansion in a market where branches are over 2 hours from the nearest branch."
The lack of branches means that each day becomes an exercise in handling complaints or cashing checks for non-customers with very little opportunity to focus on growing business.
Interaction with specialty team members was non-existent.
"Conversations about investments, mortgages, estate planning, and more are routed through call centers and handled by indifferent team members who never meet the clients and rarely close on business."
Clients would often become frustrated because there was no local investment adviser or mortgage representative to meet with and would walk out and take Clients's business elsewhere.
"Overall, my experience in the Mid-Atlantic states, - more..."
very flexible in work location.
good flexibility at work place.
too many meeting in a day .very counter intuitive to work.way too many managers..thinning needs to happen.. low skilled workers are too many.
good place to grow at your own pace
inbound and outbound calls.
collected on mortgages from 15-120 days delinquency.
base of policies of this bank I offered various alternatives to resolve the delinquent accounts.
"On the escalation help desk, I would take calls from customer heard out customer heard out their concerns's concerns, following this bank policies and procedures to deescalate calls from customer heard out their concerns."
"Quality people to work with.. Very fast paced environment, with multiple goals to achieve."
"We worked as a team, supporting each other along the way, but wanting to achieve our goals."
"Relaxed, but no place for advancement."
the training is poor.
no major place for advancement unless brown noser.
"too faced, drama."
pay rate is low.
required to take training classes that are a waste of time
Stressful.  
this bank is a good place to start out in the financial career.
"Unfortunately, there is no career advancement opportunity."
this bank is a minimal paying salary job.
Productive and fun workplace.
Productive workplace with very good management.
"Stressful at times, but very good management makes sure that you are trained properly and if you need help very good management are more than happy to step in and help."
friendly Enviorment.
hours are pretty good if branch is fully staffed.
gained valuable information on banking industry.
increased my knowledge of banking to implement into furthering my career in banking industry.
Good Atmosphere.
At this bank you knew your position and what was expected of you.
There was opportunity to grow as you wanted.
Management acknowledged your success and couched you in your struggles.
Everyone was a team and worked together to better one another.
Over all a really great place to work!
the job the job itself was awesome the managers weren't so much.
"there was no work life balance at all , I loved the job itself but the managers were very rude the managers helped who the managers liked the push up who the managers like so it felt like the managers didn't care about nothing but there numbers, the managers preach very hard about work life balance and there wasn't any, but I really love the job itself and what the job itself could have been for me"
Working at this bank.
Just conduting basic banking transactions.
"deposits, withdrawals, cashing checks, making money orders and bank checks, answering phones and have the best customer service."
Lobby engagement as well.
Horrible place to work.
My experience with this bank was terrible.
"There was a high employee turnover rate, the training that I received was horrible (made us do a bunch of web training), the pay was extremely low"
"productive, busy, energetic environment."
"a typical day at work: organized, busy-sometimes running against the clock."
"what you learned: basic job skills in my direct position title/job summary, and eventually picked up additional job-related skills; in regards to how to become a better & more efficient tester and learn more about the QA department."
management: started off strong and passionate (management that I felt compelled to work hard for
and we had each other's back).
"workplace culture: relaxed, up-beat at times, but also laid-back and comfortable-smaller group in my direction state of location."
"the hardest part of the job: can be demanding at times, due to the needs of the client & more support could have been helpful and eager to myself."
the most enjoyable part of the job: the friendships that were formed
job.
"This job was so different then any other people they did have people that had there clicks, and told on other people so save there self on what ever they did bad did not like This job had to leave."
"they have people that help only the people they like and not new customers much at all, have to be in the click to get good service."
this bank.
"Working at this bank is very laid back, the only thing is the salary is not enough."
I get my work done in a timely manner and my peers are awwesome.
Clients are friendly and everyone is very respectful.
Culture started to shift.
The environment started to become convoluted.
"There was a change in management structure, and a change in management structure was not geared toward customer relations."
"However, over the years that I spent being employed by this bank, I built strong knowledge in many areas and engaged in top client relations."
Great place to work with..
Productive and always a busy branch.
Employees are great to work with.
Training and meetings are mandatory.
Mileage and meetings are paid.
Vacations and days off are scheduled in advance.
good company treats employees fairly.
"Sales calls, meeting with clients team meeting."
Partner with corporate banking team to establish and deepen relationships with new and existing clients.
Poor Management.
Poor management and lack of training left much to be desired in the branch level.
"Benefits including health care, dental, vision, and vacation leave were great."
Processor.
Did not like the job.
I was clueless on a lot of things there.
I wish i could have not applied foe the job.
Great people to work with awesome hours.
Good days
Great company to work for!.
Human Sigma environment.
Highly recommend working for this company.
Leadership is always looking to promote the talent from within.
Healthy work environment!
Performance Driven.
Review performance metrics to determine if adjustments need made for the current day's work performance.
Monitor live performance for Inbound and outbound calling to ensure production is on track.
Handle Esclated customer calls.
Attend daily meetings to make sure target goals are being met.
Particpate in Strategic meetings to ensure the production targets are being met
"Not a great place to work, primarily due to poor management.."
"Typical bank, poor systems, lack of training and poor managers."
"They expect everyone to clean up after all the poor transacions that had been put on the books by uncontrolled sales staff in the field, at least as all the poor transacions that had been put on the books by uncontrolled sales staff in the field purtained to the filed sales staff."
Very Nice place to work with nice people.
I was working as a teller and customer service representative.
It was place to learn and fun.
Worked at the front side most of the time.
I was enjoying talking all the clients and always happy to explain all the clients the benefits.
I was very happy to see all the clients leaving satisfied and happy with my service.
Una excelente experiencia.
"Una excelente experiencia, mi último trabajo en Estados Unidos."
Crecí y aprendí mucho en el banco.
Fast paced and busy..
"Although some branches can differ from the one I work at, my branch is always busy and can get a little bit overwhelming."
Hours are good but can be changed at a moments notice.
Overtime happens a lot.
The crew I work with is great and I like doing what I do but Its not a place I want to retire from.
I got a degree in art and would like to do something regarding my degree.
horrible.
Business banking was a joke could not get loans approved goals for community bankers were the same as metro bankers the lack of local knowledge was a tremendous handicap
Worse bank in USA.
The entire culture is based on metro banking unwilling or unwilling to understand community banking entire drive is for accounts not quality a lot like the Wells Fargo system
Good Bank to work for.
"Supervision and management of the teller line, along with daily customer transactions in strengthening each relationship."
Gathering customer demographics for recommending bank products in fortifying the customer's overall financial position within the bank.
Accountable for daily cash management and ATM settlement of branch while in accordance with cash variances and auditory limits/regulations within branch operations.

"Teaching/reviewing key concepts with branch employees of loss prevention, branch limits, and fraud detection for a better understanding of policies in place for security and retention"
good place to work.
I happened to luck out and my immediate manager was great
but I think a lot of if you like this bank or not depends on this.
It is a sales position so you have to like talking to people.
this bank takes work/life balance very seriously and makes sure you have the time available to you.
day shift hours.
It is a great job but you have to be able to sell accounts and credit cards everyday and if u don't you get lectured.
Your job just isn't about banking Your job's about being a sales person.
this bank is a great company to work for.  
this bank is an incredible company with immense benefits and competitive salaries.
There is no lack towards investing into technology as well as this bank's employees.
I would recommend this bank to anyone.
Great People to work with.
In hindsight I truly enjoyed my time at this bank.
I would go back there knowing what I know now.
I believe this bank was fair with this bank's employees and gave back as what was expected.
Productive work / life balance.
"Great Management , great place to work, senior management was top notch."
"The culture at this bank was incredible, I learned great sales processes, how to take a client from the beginning to end in a client sales cycle."
Not a good place for loan officers.
Worked in the Home Lending Center and the Home Lending Center ended up being a nightmare.
"Volume was down significantly, resulting in the majority of LOs not hitting tier targets, thus leading to not making any money."
There is likely going to be any change to the compensation plan to accurately reflect how much each loan officer is funding.
It is hard to make a decent living off a low salary and very low commission.
"The leads are now stale, with internal customers being called up several times every other month."
"Processors on the backend are very inexperienced for the most part, and a lot of underwriters will poorly review files and not know product guidelines for the loan a lot of underwriters are underwriting."
"The loan officers are dependent on a lot of underwriters to make any, and it's frustrating when The loan officers perform poorly as your pay is somewhat dependent on The loan officers."
"Turn over is extremely high, with a good majority of new hires not lasting one year."
"a lot of underwriters will train you without experience, and being a large company have excellent benefits."
Horrible management not in touch with current expectations.
This bank does not promote from within.
Departments are supposed to be managed similarly however some departments can approve OT without being monitored.
Many departments hire men over women with same work experience.
this bank Cares about this bank's Employees.
"Unlike other companies where only the customer comes first, this bank differs."
As an employee for over 2 years in different positions at this banks I have come to realize that this bank equally cares about making this bank's employees happy as much as this bank's customers.
Great People.
Fast paced and a constantly changing environment.
Allows work from home opportunities.
The people are fantastic and The people really do care about the happiness of The people's employees.
customer service.
"• Encouraged and engaged customers with financial opportunities, such as creating accounts, managing checks, verification, and debit card usage Recognized for handling money, accounts, and managing currency-counting machine accurately Entrusted staff and bank members with handling sensitive documents and professional cash handling."

"Provided department training on Mainframe OS, TSO/ISPF, VSAM, File-Aid, and Syncsort."
Productive worked place.
"Productive worked a typical day will be making deposit, loan payment, withdraw money from checking or saving, issuing cashier check, cash advance taking phone call and reviewing customer account when customer have a concern or an unauthorized transaction, solving customer account issues and referring other products."
Great.
Great Company and people.
They have an amazing work life balance and take pride in their diversity.
They are all about hiring within so that you can move up in the company.
productive fast paced upbeat workplace.
a typical work day was full of interesting phone calls meeting customers from all over the world.
everyday you leaned something new.
management was exceptional management cared about you as a person and an employee the hardest part of the job was meeting daily goals.
the most enjoyable part of the job was making lasting impressions on the customers.
Its okay i guess.
Must be able to endure stressful environments as well as you must be able to take constant critisism but not in a bad way this bank is always about your growth and development as a person and employee
team work culture and getting results.
probably my most enjoyable job experience as I was at this bank for the longest stint in my career - 8 years.
An rewarding job experience - though my salary was low - I was able to get good incentive bonus pay in bringing new business into this bank.
Large company.
A lot of opportunity for growth with the most opportunity in their headquarters.
They provide flexibility in working from home depending on the department you work in.
They promote an inclusive environment.
Fun place to work.
They're very pushy with sales .
It's like you're almost begging the customer to sign up for a credit card and etc.
I loved my customers and my job.
The only thing that was stressful was sells.
Your job depended on it.
the internship was a summer internship.
"With the internship, the internship was meant to be a ten week interview on both sides and after spending my time there I did not enjoy being there."
"I never saw my boss, the work was almost non existent."
I waited weeks for software and I had to figure out how to work for the company on my own.
the company has a lot of positive going for the company but the experience I had there was unbelievably unproductive.
Review.
There was quite a lot of opportunity to advance and learn skills on the job.
Good benefits.
I met a lot of very good people working there and have since kept some as my friends after leaving this bank.
I loved that this bank allows this bank's employees to volunteer during work hours.
I also took the opportunity many times volunteering during working hours and still was paid for the hours I was away from work.
I like this bank's Grow up Great program.
No room for internals.
I applied for multiple positions and was never offered a permanent position even though I never did any wrong as a temporary.
They have a tendency to look at outside applicants more than internals.
Good Work Life Balance.
Low pay
but if you are a strong seller you can make great incentive quarterly and for great customer service.
A typical day includes outbound calling clients and setting appointments.
Upper management always wants more from you without giving you the 'title' you might deserve and still wants you to complete your own goals.
If you don't like sells stay away.
Fast Past.
"Fast Past, Competative all the time."
Expectations were very high with no real rewards.
Loved meeting all my clients.
Had many managers while I was employed by this bank.
No real leadership that you could connect with and push you along.
Horrible place to work.
Horrible place to work.
"No respect, everyone's replaceable attitude."
No advancement opportunities or promotions given.
Not one team building activity in over 3 years.
very poor management.
instead of offering more traing or allowing you to switch to a new manager while in training knowing there were issues between you and the managre the managre just let you go and then the managre black ball you from applying for 6 months and other people wont give you the time of day in an interview because your reseaning for being let go is its just not gonna work...
Best Company.
I enjoyed my time working for this company.
Being able to work at a fast pace and talking and engaging with customers.
While helping customers with customers's finances.
Very stressful place to work.
Very micro-management place.
Little advance not much to choose from and a load of work from the moment you step in to the door until your finish.
Not team work.
Very fast paced and stressful.
"I took inbound calls from customers whom wanted to know customers whom wanted to know their balance, see if a check or card payment went through their accounts's balance, see if a check or card payment went through customers whom wanted to know their balance, see if a check or card payment went through their accounts's accounts, I assisted with up-selling overdraft products to customers whom accounts were overdrawn."
"I ordered checks and debit cards, helped in locating a local ATM near customers whom accounts were overdrawn's location."
I participated in customers whom accounts were overdrawn's program that assisted blind callers in the use of an ATM machine.
"I assisted in the training of the new hire financial service consultants, I also did take escalated calls from customers whom needed to speak with a supervisor when a supervisor might not be available."
worked to many hours.  
this bank didn't care about employees.
I have two small children and the branch i'm at is under-staffed this bank want everyone to work 6 days a week all day everyday and stay late.
this bank are the lowest paying bank out of all the banks
Slaves.
Mandatory 50 hours a week.
the company took on too much too fast.
Extremely stressful because peoples livelihood was at stake.
Not enough training!
Overworked.
"As long as your department generates revenue, you can get away with anything."
"Departments that are cost centers are consistently given more work to do, with limited resources."
My review.
"It's a good job but you work your butt off and you don't get what you deserve, I'm a full time student and sacrifice so much for my job."
I wanted to get a promotion and was told that I wasn't good enough.
My job is stressful because I took on a lot of responsibility and management still didn't care.
In order to move up in the company you have to kiss everyone's butt.
Normal Bank day.
"I love working for this bank, if it wasn't for the managers the managers themselves I would never want to leave."
Although the hours are long (8am to 6pm) I still enjoyed myself while at work.
The hardest part is working with the managers who do not care about anyone but the managers themselves.
"I've made life long friends besides that, and it makes the work day go by quickly."
Web set our own goals and it was up to us to achieve our own goals..
We had a fun group to work with.
The building had a cafeteria which was convenient for lunches and snacks.
"We used our computer to sign in our start time and would log out for breaks, meetings, etc."
"The job was not hard, you just had to pay attention to detail when logging in information in the data bases as other departments depend on information to do other departments's jobs."
Great Opportunities for Advancement.  
this bank is a great company to start a career at.
The managers will work with you to make sure you are getting into the line of business that you want to work in.
The managers have plenty of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort.
Your day varies based on the position you are in.
"this bank have branches, call centers, out of branch sales and multiple other lines of business."
"The culture is very friendly, I have always enjoyed the environment created by my coworkers."
"The most difficult part of the job is the amount of goals set for someone to accomplish, it can be overwhelming, at the same time extremely motivating."
There is always something to work on.
The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created within the workplace and with the customers.
Summary.
My work experience with this bank was ok.
I was a part-time employee.
I learned many cash transaction.
Work with different kind of people and how to manage stressful environment.
Decent pay but job duties were overwhelming.
It was nice pay but the amount of work and training you go through without more pay is quite extensive.
The grading scale is quite outrageous as well depending on who is monitoring your calls.
Some are lenient some are extremely over bearing and unrealistic.
this bank a place to work.
I will not rate this bank at this time due to I am currently employed there.
There are a lot of good reasons to work for this bank but there are also a down side as well
Great Room for Growth.  
this bank has a great flexible schedule that allows me to work my job around my everyday activities.
I have learned how to better communicate with customer over the phone verses my the traditional face to face way.
The management works one on one with you to help improve your performance and answer questions.
Big Bank with Good Culture.
I really enjoyed working here.
The corporate culture was much better than the average bank and the work environment was good.
"The corporate culture felt more fun than the average bank, and the customers recognized it."
"However, pay wasn't good compared to other banks."
I was only there 3 months as a contractor.
I was under contract for a Lender Transformation project.
The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and helpful when I needed assistance.
My experience was very positive working at this bank.
Good Learning Environment.
I have learned the importance of saving money and investing intelligently by working at this bank.
this bank also recognizes this bank's employees for their employees's outstanding work ethics and offers pretty good benefits to this bank's potential clients especially college students.
It was a very challenging environment to work..
Highly regulated work environment and the level of expectations by the management was high.
Highly sales-oriented and competitive industry where I learned to become efficient tackling multiple tasks at the same time.
The toughest part of the job was banking became primarily sales instead of customer-focus and the turnover was extremely high.
Not bad at all.  
this bank is a great bank to work for.
"My position doesn't get paid enough, but for right now, My position's good."
Was a banker before I went to this bank's operations department.
"Didn't like selling equity products, but if you like that, it's great!"
"Somewhat stressful, high-pressure environment with benefits that can pay off."
Any bank is going to be high-pressure.
"this bank as a corporation does a nice job of providing compensation, benefits, and perks to make up for this."
"However, I found that the high emphasis on driving sales really affected the work environment, to the point where the high emphasis on driving sales was emphasized over customer service - especially when upper management came to visit the branch."
The corporate business model really made it hard to focus on what the job was all about - even down to the teller position.
Hard to go into everyday.
"They tell you not to be a product pusher but lay a set number of what they call 'expectations' on you to meet per quarter, which makes you a product pusher if you want to meet 'expectations'."
If you do not meet 'expectations' it affects your ability to move up within the company and also raises.
"Policies and rules constantly change and there is rarely anyone, including managers, who have the right info to give you."
"There is a survey system that is random and anonymous that asks customers questions based on your interaction, if customers even remember it was you, it is very unfair that also determines if you receive pay raises and your ability to advance in the company."
"I've received bad surveys from customers due to customers's bad interactions with a different employee all because customers survey is anonymous on who a different employee was, and it is almost impossible to come back from a bad survey."
"The maternity leave is awesome, 16 weeks of 100% pay, which honestly is the only reason I stayed with the company for my final months."
Good part time job.
I only worked at bank for four months before finding a full time job.
"I would work for bank again, however."
The training was full time for a month and prepared me well for the tasks given to !me.
Great place.
"This is a great, friendly place to work with room for advancement."
"The staff and upper management are great, and very understanding............................................."
Conversation with clients very personal.
Working for this bank was a very difficult place to work.
this bank have a this bank conversation which I felt was very intrusive for clients.
a this bank conversation which I felt was very intrusive for clients was a canned conversation that this bank expected you to use with all clients.
29 years at this bank.
this bank is very well managed both on the business and technical side.
Great Company - Very long hours and weekends.
I worked Very long hours and weekends to advance within this bank and provide my family with a comfortable life syle.
a lot of work.  
"this bank requires you to go above and beyond, but the pay rate is below."
"The typical work day is very stressful and can sometimes interfere with your personal life, if you let it."
A lot of on the phone.
don't start this job if you don't like being on the phone.
there is room for advancement but room for advancement is based on your call scores.
You must work a minimum of 20 hours and they will not allow you to work less and stay an employee.
Productive workplace.
Fastpaced environment and Highly engaging work culture.time working for the company was short but highly productive considering the type of work i had to do
laid back.
overall very slow pace and laid back people.
"It is good for juniors who are starting and eventually go somewhere else, I loved my time in there but wouldn't go back"
Depends on region.
"This bank has great products for the customer, however This bank lack moral for the employees."
it seems This bank don't appreciate employees much.
its not a hard job.
But upper management is horrible with follow-ups and encouragement.
very slow paced.
"Not much training, promised a better paying job and room for growth and did not receive, you can't trust other employees, management doesn't seem to care"
Fun place to work.  
this bank is an industry leader in many other target markets as well.
"this bank's client list includes more than two-thirds of the Fortune® 500 as well as thousands of real estate, utilities, healthcare, government, higher education and not-for-profit entities."
"All of these clients, including many of the nation's largest competitors in their respective specialties, benefit from this bank's deep industry knowledge and this bank's sophisticated capital raising, treasury management and capital markets capabilities."
"Cares about their employees, great managers!!.  "
this bank is a great place to work.
They really care about their employees and customer engagement is awesome!!
Worked for this bank for 3 years and never once wanted to leave.
Pay is a little low compared to other branches but the people and environment I work with balances it out.
Great work environment.  
this bank is a great bank to work for.
There are many opportunities for advancement in your career with this bank.
The culture around around development and coaching is very prevalent.
"As a manager, you are expected to lead your team, coach and develop your team, as well as conduct on the spot coaching."
I learned a lot in the 15 years that I worked there..
"I started out as a Teller, then I worked my way up to Assistant Manager."
I took care of customer's deposits and cashed checks.
"I opened new account, processed credit applications."
Great team working in a small town.
I worked in a small town branch where I had the pleasure of getting to know all of my regular customers very well.
The team I worked with here was very supportive and morale was always high.
Even through a merger with another bank.
Sales goals were realistic and reachable.
Fast paced / ever changing company with good advancement opportunities.
Exciting and growing financial services organization.
"Great advancement opportunities for sharp, hard-working individuals."
"Must be able to operate in a complex regulatory environment, but training is generally available - though much of training is self-directed."
Probably the best of the big banks to work for.
"Key skills that will advance your career include strong verbal and written communications, negotiating, and interpersonal skills."
You will likely participate on many cross-functional teams and many of this bank's decisions are made at a group level.
On-Site PC refreshes.
Met many excellent technicians.
"Fast paced PC refreshes, or swap, In various banks."
"Hardware and Software installs, Wipes, OS installs, proprietary software installs, thick & thin clients"
Absolutely horrible.
1 isn't even close to a low enough rating: this bank is the worst company I have ever worked for.
I had 2 years of banking (at another institution) when I came to this bank & this bank wouldn't even match the salary I STARTED with at another institution.
Management is a JOKE.
Management truly have no say in anything that goes on.
"The goals are attainable, but always changing, making it difficult to be consistent."
"The expectations are unrealistic, & again, always changing."
There is no reward or recognition for ANYTHING.
"Management do not care about Management's employees or the customer, all Management care about are numbers."
"If you are going into a company looking to advance, a company is NOT the place to do it."
"Management require you to be in your current position for a year, Management run your credit for any positions you apply for (even promotions within), your goals have to be well beyond what is expected of you, and you have to actually have a manger that cares about your development (DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH).."
I could go on forever..
"but if you like the shiny perks Management hold in front of your face & you're willing to sell your soul, you'll be just fine!"
"Side note: don't get too comfortable in your position, Management will surely displace you."
400+ jobs this year alone.
this bank.
"Good place to work, I left because I was recruited by Suntrust and persuaded by salary increase."
"management was fair and engaged, I enjoyed working with this bank."
Worst place to work!!!.
"Of all the banks that I have worked, this bank is by far the worst."
My Manager was so incompetent that it affected the performance of the branch.
This was the most stressful work environment that I ever worked in..
Typical day.
Greet customers as soon as customers walk into the door!!
Just like the Walmart greeters.
Help customers with there transaction (aka) fill out there deposit tickets or there withdrawal slips.
Or push the customer to use the ATMs or mobile deposit.
Have to save the best for last!!!
SELL SELL SELL
"Excellent people, challenging environment."
"Challenging project work, the people truly make the job!"
"During a time of intense organization transformation, lessons learned have been invaluable."
Fast-paced environment but much space for professional development.
"Great for customers, not for employees."
Poor compensation.
Lack of training.
Poor treatment and even downsizing of top performers.
Great products for customers.
Product benefits get worse and worse over time.
"Good company, could pay more."
"Advancement opportunities are present, however, the pay increase has a low cap."
The opposite is true of talent brought in from outside.
This creates an atmosphere where new hires are paid higher salaries than those who've earned a promotion and ultimately makes folks leave.
Bad business model
Generaql view of this bank.
meeting with customers and improving customers's financial well being.
"this bank is a good place to work, the are professionals to the core, but can improve on staff salary"
great place.
"great place to work, especially for college students."
"In the branch appointment setting department, we get to make our own schedule."
They off a 'new mothers' room for mothers to pump .
"Fun, productive, and steady day."
I enjoyed learning in depth about your finances and how important it is to budget and pay your bills on time.
I love the fact helping other clients manager they're monthly statements.
In-Store is Not a Good Job.
Very boring job for little pay
", your schedule is terrible, and you're basically a teller that can open accounts."
"Not at all what I expected, or was told it would be like."
"Management is great, and I do believe non-In-Store is probably a good job, but In-Store is not the best."
Not a particularly desirable place to work..
Poor communication lead to confusion and often frustration about job responsibilities.
Little recognition for excellent performance.
The hardest part of the job was to understand priorities.
Look elsewhere.
Watch your back!
It is sad to say but management would throw everyone under the bus to advance management.
management rarely gave out raises and there was no work life balance.
"Working 6 days a week, sometimes for only 3 hours a day is ridiculous when management would have 3 day weekends very often."
Coworkers are great..
Work/Life balance is fantastic.
Lots of activities to show employee appreciation.
Enjoyed working with the people in my group.
Always willing to assist when needed.
It Could Improve.
"The company has really good core values that are not always followed, even those in management."
However really good stepping stone for a better gig.
"Compensation is decent, work days a little stressful however The company does try to make the atmosphere fun."
"Also beware The company pays employee for 40 hours even if not worked, then take the difference out the next check."
Learn Fast Work Hard.
Problem Solving.
Learned about banking .
Nice clean work place.
Positive and upbeat work environment.
Strong and consistent corporate culture.
minimal opportunity for vertical movement.
maximum potential for lateral movement
great place to work overall.
this job is a lot better than most.
"other than management within the branch that I worked for, it's worth working there."
only if you're full time though.
part-timers don't get as much perks as us full-time employees.
pay is nice.
Work day.
"I was trained on many different roles and responsibilities, over all I loved my successes at this bank."
The management team and my colleagues were all team players.
Terrible Management.
"Supervisors did not make employee expectations clear, staffing was always short, working there was chaotic and stressful, all staff was severely undertrained."
It was A new field for me and I was lucky to have a great team to work with..
The hardest part of the job was learning about banking.
My manager was great and easy to talk to.
The culture was pretty serious and quiet.
The best part of the job was the experience and working downtown for the first time!
Bank Teller.
My daily tasks were to monitor the vault money and verify Bank Teller have enough to get Bank Teller through the week and make sure Bank Teller never had too much on hand.
I would assist customers with customers's everyday banking needs and transactions.
horrible.
horrible place to work.
I was part time for the 4 years i worked there.
They were ok with working around my schedule due to me being a single mother with 3 kids but overall the company was not good to the company's employees.
customer were treated better.
Productive and nice work culture.
It is fun to work at this bank Onshore.
work life balance can be maintained easily.
Work culture maintained is good with a good scope of learning and growth.
Great Benefits.
Nice place to work.
"It has its day to day challenges, but with the right skills and support, you can pull through and accomplish the various tasks at hand."
work day.
My main goal was customer service .
Making sure customers were taking care of.
Astreeful day at the bank was the annual bank audit making sure the bank pass at 100%
It's ok.
"If you're young, a good place to start a career."
Fast changing; must be flexible.
Benefits are ok.
But it's a large company; individuals can get lost in the crowd.
Lowest Pay in the Banking Industry.
"I worked for this bank for close to 5 years, and while I had the opportunity to work with genuinely good hard-working people, I finally had to go."
"Despite excellent reviews each year, the promised raises were never above 1.25%, even though the newspaper listed the CEO's raises as 43% one year and more recently around 14%."
The benefits?
"Sound good on paper, but the deductible is $3,000 per year per insured person."
They say the hire those people but those people either laugh at the low salaries or leave after a year or two.
"I worked for other local banks, so I can compare."
"this bank does NOT value this bank's employees, and it will eventually cost this bank as more and more of their employees leave for greener pastures."
I did.
Decent Employment..
"Basic, decent employment."
There isn't much to say in regards to positives besides decent employment.
No real reason to get involved in negative commentary.
Good Advancement.
Good company when it comes to being able to advance quickly.
However pay is lacking compared to external hires and internal transfers are often underpaid and undervalued.
benefits are good.
this bank is an awesome place to work.  
this bank is an exceptional place to be employed.
this bank love to guide you in your career development.
this bank care about me as a person.
this bank has great benefits.
this bank is a great company to work for.  
"this bank is a wonderful place to work, typical day at work includes 7 1/2 hours of sitting at a desk taking phone calls assisting customers with issues including online banking support, and regular checking savings account maintenance."
Slow paced and friendly environment.
What I learned about myself is that I do enjoy talking to customers and helping customers with what customers need at the time.
"The best part of my day was being able to know our customers, get to know more about our customers and create a relationship with our customers."
not a good place.
I did not receive the training I needed to independently perform my job duties.
"The assistant manager who was in charge would leave early most days with unfinished work for the new hires to complete , who did not have adequate training."
Fair work enviroment.
Management give positive reinforcement.
I appreciate the way he communicate with me..
Company show gratitude on a weekly basic thru meetings.
Branch employee spread happiness true the day.
Love to help client to meet client's financials goals.
"Good team environment, but stressful."
The team environment and the supervisors and managers are very friendly and helpful in working with customers.
"However, due to the nature of a call center, there are numerous customers these calls in every day, some of whom can be rude and unpleasant to speak with."
It is important to remain professional during these calls because calls are recorded and calls are picked at random for review with your team leader.
Fast paced and mentally challenging.
Work in cubicles helping customers with online banking concerns & questions.
Rewarding work experience.
I work evenings and the atmosphere is quiet but the call volume is very high.
Good working environment.
"The workplace at this bank is well balanced, The workplace at this bank is very much employee oriented."
It's very important for the management to listen to concerns of the management's employees.
Typical Bank Owned Culture.
Your experience at this bank is what you make Your experience at this bank.
Bank owned subsidiaries like this bank Capital Advisors are internally focused sales cultures highly controlled by risk management.
It's not Google.
Great Company.
I really liked working here and they usually will work with you if you have changes to your schedule.
Great managers and co workers and flexible schedule
None.
"Its a good job for a new entry into the workplace, but the compensation does not align the compensation with present economy."
"the workplace culture involves complete unity within the branch which includes branch manager, tellers, personal bankers, wealth management bankers, and mortgage loan officers."
"Team oriented, wonderful working environment.."
Team oriented environment.
"Manager very accessible for questions about assignments, expectations, time frames."
Manager would give realistic time frames for projects based on the teams current workload.
Manager provided one-on-one meetings weekly.
okay place to work.
customer service and coaching employees too sales goaled.
focus on customer service went away.
New management did not care about employees or customers
Poor management.
"Stressful environment, this bank want you to promote products to customers that can't afford products."
Very poor management.
People left because of management..
Overall a good company.
A good company that I like to work for..
Management can improve..
Also the bank is starting to get too sales driven.
"Other than those things, the bank are understanding and want a positive work life balance."
Motivated.
Interesting fun family oriented culture with an ever learning of the business and industry.
Everyone is involved and seems to care about the company and the company's position.
Great company.
Great work environment..  
this bank is a great company.
"Management is fair and cares about employee growth and development and invested in creating happy, productive engaged employees."
Poor compensation.
Poor compensation.
Getting promoted within the company means nothing because the company are unwilling to give you any considerable increase no matter how well you perform.
poor management.
poor management from and high turn-over due to sr management down to sales.
85%+ turn over rate while I was working there
and I hope they have since changed their way
Worst company.
the company do not care about the company's employees!
You can do 10 million things right
but your first mistake will always be your last with the company.
I was with the company for 15 years.
"Won rewards, trips etc left and right."
the company wanted to get rid of the long time employees to hire younger employees with cheaper salary.
Stressful - but fullfilling.
"If you like numbers and working with lots of money, this is the place for you."
"It's a customer service job just anywhere else, just with added responsibility."
exceeded expectations.
I left this company for better advancement and made the mistake of coming back.
I wish I stayed at my old position.
What a mistake.
The management does not care about The management's employees.
Fun place to work.
My experience has been with an awesome team.
If you are motivated to do your job well you will reap the rewards.
"your job is a great job, and I strongly recommend working for the company."
Fun company.
Very good company to work for which this bank had a lot of great people working for this bank.
I learned a very great deal working with this bank on how to work with business owners.
Workplace.
The associates are great to work within the site.
The compensation needs to improve.
The management sometime can be overwhelming.
The work place culture is enjoyable.
Needed some help.
The company was bought out but it was a good starting job out of school for those who did not have any work experience.
you have to start somewhere so i would say try a bank or a call center every time if you don't know what you want to do.
Good benefits.
"Good benefits for the employees, work under sales pressure required to be able to meet manager's expectations."
Management can have unrealistic sales goals expectations for Management's employees.
Great Place.
"Honestly a great place to work at, company wise."
Compensation does need to be a tad more especially in retail banking.
You do twice the work and get paid for 1.
What a terribly managed comapny.
I don't recommend this company to anyone who wants to have a helpful and constructively kind manager.
All managers are ruthless and you have no job security and are constantly threatened.
Def not a good company to work for.
Management don't assist Management's agents when their agents need assistance.
"Management are never around when you need help and lucky if Management're at Management's desk and Management will not help you, unless you are Management's favorite."
"Management come to work high and not only can you tell, but you can smell it on Management."
A Very High turn around.
I would not recommend anyone to work for this company
Great company.
"Plenty of opportunity for advancement, be prepared to work hard and always be ready for change."
Product offering is large and is designed to meet the needs of the customers.
horrible.  
"this bank is a stressful work environment to be in, between the everyday tasks supporting the customers this bank also give you a million things to do as far as stalking customers for more sales etc. calling there homes being yelled at if sales goals aren't made"
Above Average Company.
This has been almost the best job I have ever had.
"Even if you start out at the 'lowest' position at this bank, you are given ample opportunity to advance and really make a career for yourself."
"As a teller, I had the chance to go to monthly meetings and feel important, spoke with my manager on a regular basis on my goals for my career and how I was going to get there, and was just in a great environment with management that showed management actually cared about me."
"this bank is NOT heavy on sales, this bank really focus on taking care of the customer and believing in the benefits for the customer."
this bank don't want to shove a credit card in someone's face that isn't going to benefit from a credit card.
"Sure, there is incentives and payouts, but customer service truly is number one for this bank."
I will miss working for this bank very much.
"Started out a great place to work, and now...not so much!."
"The first 3 1/2 years I spent at this bank, a great place to work was like a dream job!"
Then new management rolled in.
Throughout the entire company.
Then a great place to work became a nightmare job!
"Stupid ridiculous processes that new management forced us to use, but new management didn't use Stupid ridiculous processes that they forced us to use new management and constantly made us look stupid."
"Then new management withheld raises and only gave raises to the people new management liked, who fell in line with new management."
Terrible culture
and just continues to get worse!
Csr. Worked as a teller.
Also opened/closed accounts.
Offered products and service to new and existing clients.
Made phone calls trying to bring new clients in
Great Place.
"This is a great place to work, advancement may not come fast but the people are wonderful."
the people really let you come to work and do your job efficiently without the micro management.
nice friend and family oriented place to work.
I would come in at 8am open the branch clock in count the money in the safe and also at my register.
I would look at the message board for any up coming promotions or objective for the day.
Greet every customer with in the 5Seconds of every customer's arrival and assist every customer with anything the might need.
great place to work.
great place to work to get banking experience with good benefits get to grow and move up in the company quickly.
friendly coworkers and management overall good place to work
A Great Workplace.  
"this bank offers a great, fair workplace!"
Enjoy the morale and opportunities to grow from within.
Most managers are fair and great to work for.
The experience is what you make it.
"The more you put into The experience, the more you get out of The experience."
this bank.
One of the best banking call center environments Ive worked for.
not only are this bank very flexible with schedule but this bank do every this bank can to show that this bank care about this bank's employees.
Wonderful Employer.
I've been with this bank for almost 2 years now.
this bank is a good company to work for.
I started off in regular customer service and a year later took a job in business banking.
There is so much room for advancement here as long as you do your job.
I would definitely recommend working for this bank.
"It's not just a job, as it can lead to a career."
I don't plan on leaving this bank and hope to keep advancing.!
no place for advancement.
I had worked there for 2 years with a masters degree and i had been told how good of an employee i was but when any.... and multiple openings happened for advancement i was left in dark.
Advancement Issues.
I was hired at this bank as a contract employee.
My contract was to consist of 3 months with possibility of conversion to Full Time status.
I was first extended at the end of my 3rd month for an additional 3 months.
"Then, extended again for another 3 months."
Totaling 9 months.
You'l never be enough.
The goals they have given to tellers are insane and completely unachievable.
"Even if you miraculously it the minimum requirements to earn incentives and keep your job, it won't be recognized and no matter what you do it'll never be enough."
High Stress / High Demand Workplace.
Always being 'coached' and pushed to SELL.
Goals are unrealistic.
Plan to work overtime and 6 days a week.
"Always under-staffed and the managers rarely work extra hours, especially Saturdays."
"No written warnings if you make a mistake, they just fire you on Friday afternoon."
Benefits are good but no work life balance.
Not every department has the same expectations and shifts and bonuses are different in each department.
Some departments do not offer bonuses and won't allow you to request time off unless you use your vacation time and your vacation time has to be available that day that you need off.
No one really cares what you have going on outside of this bank and you can trade shifts with co workers but if your department isn't 24 hours and you can only trade with people on your shift that males trading difficult because more than likely everyone just about works the same shift.
"Money is great for a full time employee every two weeks buy be prepared to eat, sleep, and breathe nothing but this bank!"
Have to meet your goals.
If you do not meet your goals then you will be written up.
It is very stressful when the pressure is on you to meet the companies quota.
You do not want to harass customers and force customers into loans and credit cards if customers do not want loans and credit cards.
the company doesn't care.
the company want accounts opened and loans approved.
horrible communication.
"No communication between upper and lower management, redesigned horrible payscale that limits any opportunity for advancement or raises, demotions, overworked."
HORRIBLE place to Work!!!.
I started with a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there.
"When a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there come along, a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there tried EVERYTHING to cut my salary...said $29,000 was WAY over a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there's pay scale for a Customer Service Rep!!!"
"After many unsuccessful attempts, a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there called me & another lady that had been there for 14 years, into an office and said a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there were letting me & another lady that had been there for 14 years go...but me & another lady that had been there for 14 years would get a severance package."
"The day AFTER I found a new job, I was told by management that management now needed me....and when I said no, I was let go with NO SEVERANCE whatsoever!!!!"
"The only thing a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there cares about is making money, NOT about the customers!!!"
this bank.
I worked here for 10 years.
I began as a receptionist and ended as a paralegal in ERISA compliance.
Overall this bank was a very good place to work.
this bank provided a reasonable compensation partnered with a very nice benefits package.
"Save only one, my immediate supervising managers were exceptional and very responsive to my work place needs."
I became one of the 'casualties' in a this bank wide downsizing.
Great place to work.  
this bank is a wonderful company.
I take pride in being a part of helping this bank's clients every day.
this bank take care of the employees also.
I'm looking forward to a long career here.
Good focus on client retention and cross-selling.  
this bank is very focused on how to improve this bank's clients financial well being.
Making sure every avenue is taken to assure the client that the products and services being offered is in the client's best interest.
Work with good people.
I really enjoy the people I work with and the atmosphere that my peers would create.
My immediate supervisor was good to work with as well.
"Maybe not as hands on as what is needed, but assisted in other ways."
The problem is the goals.
"There is still what I call a 'Wells Fargonian' mentality driven by the company's upper management to push products, hit monthly and quarterly selling goals and not ever talk or concern our upper management about the incredible service the company provide, but rather how much money did the company make the company."
Low pay for what is expected..
I had a great branch manager and district manager.
Just way too much put on your plate.
A lot to know and many many jobs to do.
this bank is cutting corners everywhere and putting the burden on this bank's underpaid employees.
terrible management led me to quit.
I was treated horrifically once promoted and moved to a different location to work.
I was thrown in with minimal training and held to unrealisitically high standards.
"I did not like what was told to me, how I was treated compared to the other employees, how I was pushed to do all the work and forced to train employees, while the manager only pushed me and gave severe punishment for falling behind in the pile of work the manager never gave me the chance to do."
this bank is very good to this bank's employees.
I would highly recommend working for this bank.
"The building that I worked in was a very relaxed atmosphere, its employees are very friendly, like working with family."
fast pace and stressful.
cashed checks .
deposited checks and cash.
opened accounts for customers.
best part were the people I worked with .
hardest part was smiling while being cursed out by customer for requesting info to verify an account
Great work-life balance.  
"this bank makes all the employees feel like all the employees are valued, this bank also offer many benefits to all the employees and allows employees to move up within the this bank"
this bank.  
this bank is a great employer very invested in this bank's employees success.
this bank continue to recognize me as an employee and continue to work to make this a more engaging atmosphere
"this bank is a place of structure and excellence, always looking to propel other's into their future.."
"One thing I learned is this, I cannot allow the personalities of people to be the set thermometer of the overall vision, but rather realize we are all a gathered people who are set to reach one common goal and one common goal is to increase the value of this bank and to change the overall demographics of a culture, where, through the initiative of this bank every person, family, business, etc. is prospering."
"So as a company, this bank was great!"
"this bank always made sure, through many on-line quizzes this bank, the frontline was sharp and knew how to effectively, with intentionality, meet the needs of this bank's customers."
And this bank has great honorary benefits for those who desire to put those who desire to put their best foot forward's best foot forward.
this bank really do care.
Not able to grow unless you know someone.
It is more about who you know versus what you know.
"People with no experience and education are promoted versus someone with experience or education, because of who People with no experience and education know."
Benefits are terrible.
You need a second job to pay for the high deductible insurance plans.
ok place.
I worked there many years ago...the building is no longer there and I am not even sure if the department is still there.
I encoded fields onto the actual check and had to balance each deposit.
Depends on position.
"This could be a great place to work, if management cared more about the salary of management's employees."
If their employees were more hands on and less fouced overall with none importgant factors.
Ok Job.
Good work life balance but job job itself is very stressful.
I have learned a lot about the industry but would like to learn more.
Although very challenging at times job itself can be rewarding as well.
Great work place.  
this bank cares about this bank's employees.
its employees are easy to schedule around and there are get working enviroment.
this bank has the easy going management that you can talk to if there is ever a problem this bank are always willing to help.
Great job to move up.  
this bank is a great place to work.
This job has allowed me to learn different aspects of being a bank teller.
Most people think being a teller is just counting out money to the customer.
You actually do more than what meets the eye.
"You are working face to face with customers, meaning your skill need to be on point."
You have to give the customers this bank's undivided attention.
"You process many bank transactions, and managing a lot of cash during the day."
Fun place to work in and productive.
"Nice to work with costumers, working with our customers helping our customers reach our customers's goal in saving and learning hoe to manage our customers's money."
"Working in customer service, giving our customers advice on our customers's financial problems."
Great place to work.
"Great place to work, good management."
This is my second time working for this bank and I love what I do.
A typical day is that I am not micromanaged.
I continue to learn each day.
The culture is good.
I really enjoy coming into work each day.
"The only con is that my position is in Downtown Pittsburgh where you have to may to park, however that is not job duty related."
"Fun, hospitable enviroment."
I learned to pay attention and respect each person with each person's particular needs and culture.
We worked as a team and it was delightfull to be among different cultures united for the same goal: company + team= everyone grows.
Good company but some managers need training.
"On a typical day, it is business as usual and I learned to be self motivated."
"I worked under different managers, some very professional and pleasant to work with, others very poor at human relations."
"Workplace culture is good per company policies, but under a manager who is inexperienced or mischievous, workplace culture is nothing to write home about."
The hardest part of the job is relating with managers who are not good.
The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what you are experienced at.
A Good Place to start your career.
Good place to start a career and find better employment.
"All the good people quit, but the CIO will tell you they are hiring and retaining more than people are leaving."
Good people to work with but we are the hardest to do business with.
Disappointing work environment.
"I always heard great things about working for this bank, but after joining the team I was able to see a different side."
"I experienced a lack of leadership, the branch experienced a lack of support from upper management."
"For a 4-5 month period, including over the holidays which are the busiest times of the year, the branch was left with barely a staff."
Many times there was only one teller when there needed to be three.
"The manager cared more about sales versus customer service, and many times would deceive the customer."
upper management was well aware of the problems in the branch and didn't seem to bother to help.
As I kept working there I was starting to hear from other people in this bank how this bank was changing and not for the better.
"If the right management was in place, the business and branch could have been very successful."
Team Environment.
One of the Best Organization have one of the Best Teams.
Helpful Resources.
Nothing hard -Lot of Learning Opportunity to get rid of Hard Situation.
Working with most Senior Management lead to one step ahead in your career and this bank is one of one step ahead in your career.
Productive and fun workplace..
I worked at this bank for three years.
I can say that I enjoyed working for this company.
this bank offered me the opportunity to learn different skills to make me a greater asset to this company.
this bank really pushed for people to step in being leaders.
remote uw.
I am thankful for the opportunity and knowledge I received at this bank.
I've worked for this bank for almost 6 years and I have worked very hard in my position.
Consistant.
"Sales, cold calling with bank staff, worked closely with Business Banker."
Easy to sell merchant services with bank products.
Catered to small/mid size businesses.
Established bank and bank products.
Customers were the best part of the job.
Not much customer service as products and equipment worked.
Banking.
Working at this bank is like working at any other bank.
"You run transactions, open accounts, do loan applications for cars, mortgages, lines of credit, as well as make referrals."
Good starting place
and
learned a lot.
This job is a good learning experience for me.
This job helped me understand the world of finances a lot more and helped me better maintain my own personal finances.
Some days were harder than others but I believe that is how it would be at any job there will always be ups and downs you just need to learn to work through ups and downs you just need to learn to work through it.
Productive.
This place was a great start to learning the world of banking.
It was great to learn the financial institution as well as working with the different clients
Great.
There was much to love about working here.
The facetime with senior level executives was next to none.
"The work could have been delineated better, but The facetime with senior level executives was a great experience."
this bank Postions.
I work on certification of applications to make sure that every people has the right access to only the applications every people need.
I audit over 30 thousand plus employees quaterly
pros vs cons.
"the branch managers are good, mine is helpful."
"the upper management don't even know you exist, the salary is good, the incentives are a joke."
never a set schedule and don't expect your manager to work a Saturday.
Work along with fun and very encouraging staff.
the work culture is good and good exposure to the subject.
Work along with fun and very encouraging staff.
But cell phones are not allowed which was difficult
Large Company.
Large company with opportunity for advancement if you get the right management team.
you're able to transfer within company which is a plus.
the pay was ok.
Good experience.  
"this bank is a really great company, I work in the collections department and the collections department's a very fast-paced job."
"If you get stressed easily, I don't recommend the collections department."
The people here are incredible.
Excellent place to work.
I cannot say more about how great this bank is as a place to work.
"this bank is WORK though so be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get to work, as you are worked to the bone."
"At then end of the day though, you are rewarded for your efforts, and have a great sense of accomplishment"
"Friendly working environment, was a great learning experience."
We had a busy branch.
Customers would come for different transactions.
"I learned new things related to banking, met new people, and enjoyed helping customers."

Need to proficient with technology
Great place to work for the driven.
Excellent company to work for.
Provides a competitive environment while keeping the cliques to a minimum.
Compensation isn't great and takes a while to kick in.
"Great Place, great people good company."
Excellent place to work.
very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good.
career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.
"Great Place, not so good for Part Time Employees."
Being a part time employee you have to wait a year for vacation days.
Banking hours are not good for someone that wants to have a second job unless you can find someone that will accept you starting after 4pm.
They have great management.
"Nice place to work, pay could be better."
great company.
this was a fun company to work for they put a lot of time into training their employees and you can tell they value you as a person.
the hours are great also
Great company with uncertain future with certain product lines.
"Overall, a very good company."
It was a positive working culture with many great people in management and staff.
The biggest issue for me was that the product line that I worked with in collections became extinct.
The jobs I had in collections were incentive based.
"When I was transferred to another department, the incentive opportunities were not there."
So this caused me to me to have decreased income even though I was a good standing employee with the company for years.
Great place to work.
great management and leadership.
retired in 2014 and enjoyed all the years that I worked for this bank.
Great place for advancement.
The hardest part was leaving a place I enjoyed going to.
Great learning experience.
The program was designed to teach you how to run a bank from the cosumer and business sides.
The hardest part was retaining all the information you had to learn and the most enjoyable part was traveling to all the different headquaters for trainings.
limited opportunities.
i enjoy the people i work with but the advancement is limited.
"did not inform employees in a timley manner, a lot of tech issues on a daily basis."
good team engagement
Challenges.
Fast paced environment.
It is not for the faint-hearted.
Will challenge your customer services skills and your response to resolved upsetting situations.
this bank.
"I enjoy the banking accounts & other products that this bank supplies, but the particular office I worked for was poorly ran in my opinion."
the particular office I worked for employed an universal banking consultant that did several illegal things on a daily basis and regardless of reporting to my manager was never taken serious until things really escalated.
"an universal banking consultant that did several illegal things on a daily basis and regardless of reporting to my manager was eventually let go, but only after driving the other staff to transfer and seek employment outside this bank."
Good Place to work.
Very happy with management and work balance.
Culture is very distributed as a result of Teleworking.
The most difficult part of the job is adjust to the work requirements including weekends.
Work life balance.
I have received a tremendous work from home/office balance that has helped me to maintain work/life balance.
This is likely not possible in all departments but definitely exists within the company.
Great starter Job.
"I learned a lot about finances working here, which also helped in my personal life."
"They are a huge company with great benefits, they just don't like to pay employees enough."
Was a good place for a career..

The people are the ones that make it go.
Overall.

Great workplace culture.
Everyday was always a little different and challenging.
Learned a lot about Foreign Exchange and banking.
Allowed me to better myself in a great workplace enviroment.
Brand Ambassador.
This position was brand new and it was like developing a new business more then working on a structured and established department in the bank.
The advancement prove to be non-existent and that where the down fall begins with This position.
My thoughts and ideas of This position was far different then management and that didn't help a structured and established department in the bank.
"This position became a guerilla sales position, which was not the best idea as ghost accounts were created by potential customers just looking to take advantage of the promotions."
Good place to start a career.
I started my career at this bank in 2005 and have been here ever since.
this bank was a great place to work many years ago.
There was always something going on to boost company morale.
something going on to boost company morale has changed a lot ever since this bank was acquired.
"There are still attempts to boost morale and the activities coordinator in the building that I worked in did a great job with the budget the activities coordinator in the building that I worked in was given every year, but employees could tell that there was cuts made and that some things were now off limits."
A place to grow your profession.
Excellent place to work.
Great systems that make your daily work easy.
Employees development is of the core aim of the bank with constant training to better Employees's performance
Vauge Onboarding Policies.
Found myself subject to a 'Probation Period' with no guidance.
Some passive-aggressive attitudes seem designed to derail success and productivity.
Vague direction from leadership and a lot of course corrections.
Work/Life Balance is taken seriously.
Work/Life Balance's a great company to start off with !
Work/Life Balance hosts numerous events showing appreciation for the employees and that the employees's hard work never goes unnoticed!
this bank is excellent!.  
"this bank makes sure you are engaged with this bank at all times, which creates a huge work life balance for you."
"this bank is awesome, this bank make sure you are always taken care of and on the right path to success!"
loan officer.
"Processing department was very slow, had many deals die while being processed."
"Pay rate was low, benefits as far as health and vacation were good."
Work atmosphere was good.
It's ok if your not the sole financial provider..
The atmosphere is comfortable.
The pay is low.
The background process is discriminating and bias.
The challenges that they put their candidates through is not worth the pay.
It's usually the jobs like that.
Good place to be at with nice work-life balance.
Managers are very realistic and set well defined goals.
Managers understand tasks and help to achieve tasks if we need help.
Great place with good work-life balance.
Freedom to try newer/better ways to achieve goals.
Competitive place to learn.
Productive and Fun workplace.  
this bank is a very good company to work.

I like the work culture and the management.
I am able to balance both my personal and work life.

this bank comapny was my best experince of my life to do work over there ..
in this bank comapny i were work very hard and daily work is typical .i learned a lot of knowledge about work of construction and how to management the work and work in decipline .
the envoiurment of this bank comapny is very good and very cultural.and this is the most enjoyable part of the job.
"the work is great, management is terrible."
the neighborhood is nice.
the boss was arrogant and kind of racist.
the most enjoyable part of the work was the work and interacting with the customers.
Poor leadership.
"With the exception of the guy who initially managed me, the leadership in Greater Maryland is pathetic."
All former BofA managers who must've had helluva good resumes because it did not carry over to the position.
Best work life balance anywhere.
There is a reason why this bank is always on the top of 2017 NAFE Top Companies for Executive Women.
The work life balance is great.
The positions are generally very secure.
"The salaries are lower than the industry average, healthcare isn't on par."
"Raises are incredibly, shockingly, and insultingly low."
Great place of employment.
Great company with growth opportunity.
Company is ahead of the curve in the industry and always does right by Company's clients.
Ethical and honest culture and would highly recommend.
"Great people, poor pay, little room to grow."
Great environment if you embrace change regularly.
Must be self-starter.
Training needs to be consistent within departments.
Management does not always have background in area Management are managing.
"If you start making any decent money, the commission structure will inevitably change and you are back where you started 5 years prior and are unable to retain any consistent book of business."
People within region are wonderful to work with.
Position has turned into a sales job.
Position was not as customer oriented as advertised.
New sales requirements and significant staffing reductions made it very difficult to do a sales job.
Was a great company.
I thoroughly enjoyed working for this bank.
I truly feel like this bank is a company that cares about this bank's employees.
There are always advancement opportunities with this bank.
ok.
It was a good job
but they don't care about employees.
The people were nice to be around but there was no work life balance.
I feel like we didn't et paid enough for what we did.
Great Environment.
Great culture and environment.
They have a great culture where you can advance in the company.
The salary was the only reason why I left this bank.
There was a 10% cap on advancing in the company.
I am a college graduate and deserve much more to live comfortably.
fun environment.
"Overall, The branch was a fun place to work."
"The branch was in a good place, surrounded by restaurants."
The customers were fun to talk to and the other employees made the day more fun.
"It was difficult to work on the referrals, which drove down our monthly bonus."
"Our branch never received a bonus, which was one of the issues I had with the company."
"The other issue I had, and was the main reason I left, was the pay."
not sure of employment.
"stress, stress, stress, worked on production, hard to kept up with quotes set each month, everyday what we were looking for was changed (sometimes from hour to hour) you never knew what you were looking for, never had anything to say positive all negative, but ha good benefits"

"But, culture is something that you cannot actually see, except through culture's physical manifestations in your workplace."

Provided excellent training for such a goal which has stuck with me in my daily life.
I believe customer service is one of the most important goals of any job.
Sales Driven.
Really pushes sales to help drive business.
Was seasonal so sales goals were hard to meet during the off season since client were seen on a regular bases.
Lots of friendly and knowledgable people.
I worked there for 7 years and was treated fairly.
Left on my own accord to pursue a more challenging job.
very relaxed atmosphere with good benefits.
Very productive and tedious job.
A typical day at work for me is withdrawing and depositing money for customers.
Handling very large amounts of money throughout the day.
The hardest part of the day is the customers always.
Decent place to work.
"There's a lot of room to grow, but upper management micro manages you."
"There's hundreds of calls, sales goals are not optional, the benefits are terrible."
good day.
I like working here at this bank I am just looking around exploring my options.
Its a great place to be and such a friendly culture this bank love this bank's clients our clients love this bank
Fast Pace Environment.
Being responsible for others money can be stressful in itself but as long as your precise in your job task the job is fairly easy.
The pay could be better.
Fun and interactive.

The neighborhood all would stop by and you got to know the neighbors very will.
Great training and caring people.
No customer service.

Loss mitigation.
"This company could be awesome, but the experience is taken away by manegerial flaws to the 25th power."
Any company you work based on culture starts at the top.
this bank loss mitigation department heads have no real relationships with what is going on with staff and barely supervisors.
"Upper managemt in any way shape or form does not help to streamline a process, but add more and more to a lengthy overdrawn process as well."
Upper managemt believe in a do as i say not as i do sort of management style.
Upper managemt are exempt we are not kind of attitude creating an us against Upper managemt mentality.
This is not good management and it starts from the top.
Seldom do you hear any good news from the loss mit dept.
the loss mit dept also do layoffs each year.
the loss mit dept tell you there are no layoffs.
Then turn right around and do it.
the loss mit dept also you personal agenda's to pick who goes.
"If your looking for safety, happiness, home, and a feeling that you matter this is not the spot."
"If you looking for drama, constant change, no help, no sympathy, not making it easier for employees to maximize employees's job."
This company is not the place!
This is purely based on upper management on Ohio and Jacksonville.
You have been informed.
Nice starting job.
"Nothing spectacular, nothing to crazy."
Great people to work with.
Most of the time it is a relaxed place.
Not extremely hard on goals or sales.
Overall great environment to work in.
Productive and fun place to work with great opportunities for upward mobility.

The customer service terrific across-the-board including telephone banking and internet services.
Sales Quota's.
If you work in the Giant In-Store Locations then you will be stressed out because you have to get accounts from customers coming into Giant to buy grocery's and you can only do so much.
"Productive, fast paced Work Environment."
I loved working here and always having the opportunity/possiblilty to take online classes to learn different aspects of the banking industry.
"But we were often short tellers, and I would be asked to travel to different branches to help out."
Fast paced and extremely competitive enviorment.
"Very fun, fast paced enviorment."
"People are easy to get along with, so was management."
Left for personal reasons otherwise I would still be working there.
Never know what the day brings!.
"Open accounts, Close Accounts, angry people happy people, Loans, credit card, Ratings from customers, Rude managers, unhappy co-workers, stressed about numbers but always over achieved any goal I set or the company required."
Good place to work.
"Pros: Professional environment, I would highly recommend."
Pay seems to be commensurate with experience.
Decent benefits.
Cons: Seems to be an overabundance of middle management personnel
N/a. I have no work life balance as a full time consultant.
I have asked for a schedule change for over a year now.
And was forced to take a part time schedule just to be able to be home when my children get out of school at 4:30pm my schedule of 1:30-10pm was never the ideal schedule forever.
Productive and good compensation with Benefits.
"Great place to work, a good manager and good teamwork."
I enjoy working in this bank because the workplace is comfortable and is where people can grow and learn.
A fairly good company to work for.
"Not the best compensation, but good benefits and friendly co-workers."
Advancement opportunities are limited.
The on-site cafeteria is nice to have if you are in a rush for lunch.
Plenty of opportunity for growth and advancement..  
this bank is an encouraging place to work with great management and opportunities to advance your career.
this bank has a wide variety of options to fit the career you are looking for and will work with you to help you land the position you desire.
Excellent company to work for.
I was in charge of large sums of money entering and leaving the bank.
"Everything had to be precise and of course, provide excellent customer service."
I mostly enjoyed the interaction with customers and the responsibility.
Ok.
"Wish I was able to be trained for everything that came my way , job was very hard with little to no help , call off by cashier may job very hard on CSM"
"shady company. worked for them for 6 years laid off with zero notice, do not care about their employees, only care about shareholders."
would not recommend to work for.
I love the job.
I have to move but the job is amazing.
Flexible hours
I really like the job..
Good monery to be made also withc ommission but a very small salary but a very small salary is oikay
Consistant workflow with many great programs for employees.  
this bank offered amazing training (both in person and online) for employees to constantly better employees's skill sets and advance to the next level of employees's career.
I made a lot of really good work relationships that I still have today from my time at this bank.
Fun and a great opportunity to know people.
"A teller is a very mechanical type of work, but the fun part is the opportunity to know people, help people, talk to people and know people's stories."
"It's a very peaceful place, no rush or anything, the manager hardly talk to you."
The compensation The compensation's not good.
"Great training, lots of advancement choices."
Worked in large call center with several ammenties for employees.
large call center with several ammenties for employees offered many positions in different departments.
Plenty of room for advancement.
Nice environment if the management was good.
"when you go into the job and work its not really hard, its just more of the environment."
the management where i work is lazy.
when you get slammed you get no help.
Good company...low pay.
The environment was great.
The people are great.
The only con I have with this bank is the compensation is on the low end for finance.
"There are bonus opportunities, but until you hit the upper levels of management the compensation is lacking."
You do work in a 9-5 environment and that is a big plus.
The part of this role that was the most irritating was the outbound calling of your customers.
Having to dial 15 customers per day to 'invite' (solicit) 15 customers to come in for a financial checkup was never fun.
I felt like a telemarketer at times.
Quick-paced work space.
At this bank there is always something to do.
"Between cooking and preparing food and running food out to customers and filling orders, there is always something to do to keep you busy."
It is a fun place to work if you make it that way.
"If you make it fun and interesting, it will be that way."
You have to take your career in your hands.
Nothing is given and much is required and expected.
Overall Good.
Normal banking job.
Your day will be based upon what office you are in.
Decent corporate culture.
Very involved in the community.
Room fro advancement.
Decent Company.
Overall good work environment
"but the pay was not NEARLY enough to compensate for the workload, which typically (for most positions) was enough for 2 to 3 people."
Productive workplace.
Great co-workers..
Good work place.
I love the way the staff that the staff treat me with respect.
the staff showed me how to be a leader and not a follower.
"Before I went back to school, I was doing clerical work."
Another good company to work for.
It's been over 20 years since I worked for Another good company to work for.
While I was there I enjoyed my time there.
I advanced steadily through Another good company to work for.
The pay was comparable.
High paced work enviorment.
I learned that being a bank teller was much more work than it appeared to be .
In my opinion a bank teller should pay more.
The hardest part was feeling I was working to hard for the pay I received .
Great place to work.
As a student this was the perfect opportunity for me.
I was able to make more than minimum wage and provide for myself.
This is also a fantastic place for people that have families as well.
Great Bank.
I enjoyed working at this bank and would recommend this bank to all.
Wonderful management and great training.
There is a lot of opportunity to grow with this bank and this bank encourage it.
"N/a. Overall, this bank is a fantastic company to work for."
"this bank are very development focused, have great benefits, and are more or less fair in decision making, though a little on the low side for incentives and salary."
My biggest issue with this bank is the job security and some of the management I have worked with being retained when the job security and some of the management I have worked with really shouldn't.
Not for the faint of heart.  
"this bank tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all."
Even in emergency situations.
"The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day."
"For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again."
"Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally."
Employees are good to work with..  this bank isn't a bad place to work if you can deal with the favoritism and politics.
You grow with this bank if you are in good with management.
There is not an equal opportunity in growth unfortunately.
Friends promote friends.
It's retail.  
this bank is honestly a decent company to work for if you have the right team.
I enjoy working with customers and helping customers with customers's needs.
I also enjoy building relationships with customers.
I don't like the pushy sales atmosphere.
The minimum requirements for sales is absolutely absurd.
Very stressful with calls..
Fun place to work at.
Stress with back to back calls and government regulations.
Managers were very supportive.
Learning how the banking industry works
Great company to work for..  this bank was a great company to work for and family oriented.
Only reason I left this bank was to raise my children or elseI would have never left.
I would love to work for this bank again.
Exciting Workplace.
"My time here was short, only because I was going to college full-time."
"On an average day, our branch manager would do funny impressions and make us laugh."
our branch manager was a kind person who opened our branch manager's home to us every Christmas.
I loved working with my coworkers and enjoyed the regular customers.
"It's a nice environment, I love my customers but its not a fair company."
Management talks much about how Management support Management's employees and want their employees to succeed but when you reach out to grow within the industry Management do nothing for you.
fun workplace.
"Great place to work, You will learn a lot about all aspects of banking."
"Very professional workplace, and a very great start for students right out of college to learn the business."
Great Company.
Great bank that provides work life balance.
Benefits and culture are great.
Could be tough to advance to different positions but the company is willing to help.
Learning ability is wonderful.. Used many of the investigative skills throughout my experience as a Fraud Investigator.
"Being new to the company, everyone was very helpful."
Manager was experience and was opened to suggestions as well as helping solve your problems.
unorganized and chaotic place to work.  
this bank was under bad management.
The people were all very weird and the environment was scary.
The checks were always late and there was always drama going on.
Work Experience.
"Great place to get work experience, especially if you are new in the finance or banking industry."
Intense training.
Benefits are ok.
Salary does not match with the amount of work.
"Low pay, but good culture that excuses an occasional mistake and gives one a relative sense of good job security.."
Excellent place to work.
I left for higher pay but have regretted it ever since.
I assumed all 'big banks' were the same but all 'big banks' are not.
"Good management, good work/life balance, and good benefits."
Pay below average and that is only negative.
In store sucks.
"If you want to advance your career, I do not suggest that you work at an in store branch."
do yourself a favor and work at a traditional branch.
"on the plus side, in the last year and a half I have worked there, I have gotten $7,000 in raises."
Team Work with Fun.
"I was mostly involved in my daily work like Conducting JAD Session, Attending meetings( Walkthrough, Retrospective), Making BRD, FRD."
Data Mapping using MS Visio.
Professional.  
this bank has a professional work environment.
Employees work together under tight deadline to achieve Employees's goals.
Accuracy and production is a must.
Great easy going workplace.
"Typical workday includes reviewing documents for accuracy, getting documents signed, notarized, scanned into the system and then shipped out to the appropriate law firm."
I've learned the culture of working in an office and am very proficient in most Word processing software as well as other various online applications that are used throughout the day.
Management is awesome with all warm and smiling faces.
The hardest part of the job would be sitting at a desk alone without anybody around to communicate with while at the same time that is also the best part because it leads to better focus and work flow.
The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely being able to work at my own pace and seeing at the end of the day all that I have accomplished.
Fun productive enviroment.
Work on your own but also worked as a team to get all the production that needed finished for the day.
I learned how to push myself to get great production numbers on my own.
Worked from home 3 out of 5 days a week.
Productive Work Culture.
I worked at this bank Mortgage for almost four years.
It was a very professional environment and overall I enjoyed my time there.
"The pay scale was low and while the benefits were reasonably good, I had had better."
There were layoffs and my job was among layoffs.
very stressful.
The employee turnover with staffing in very bad lot of under staffing issues.
employee not given all the proper work tools in order to be productive daily.
A good place to work.  
this bank is full of opportunities for anyone that is willing to work hard and earn opportunities for anyone that is willing to work hard and earn them.
"this bank offer peak-time, part-time and full time hours, which should work for almost anyone."
The welcome students and work around students's schedules.
"this bank, has very good medical benefits at an extremely reasonable cost for full-timers, and also for part-timers."
"I believe if I were just starting out in the business world, this bank would certainly be on my list."
Stay away.
"Terrible work/life balance, horrible management and bosses, years behind in technology and workplace applications for being a bank."
Stay away from this company for work and banking needs.
productive.
This is the same as BNY Mellon as BNY Mellon were bought by BNY Mellon.
the culture was the same and management.
the hardest part of the job is not having enough employee to do the work.
work overload.
not a bad company to work for.
It was a very good experience to work there.
employees are treated farily.
"Its a fast faced environment, you can be very productive."
Extensive training provided for success.
Good Company to Start your Career.
rGood Company to start your career.
Salary is good and some leader will help you move up the career ladder.
you can leader a lot in a shorty time.
the sky is the limit
"I like the work itself for this bank, Wish this bank's pay was competitive."
"I work as a banker at this bank, I do not have any complaints about the work the work itself, however I wish this bank's pay was competitive with other banks."
Beside that this bank offers really good benefits and paid time off.
Seev below.
My workday was predictable and productive.
Several years of data entry.
Enjoyed the employee appreciation programs and perks.
PC really supported family issues
great job.
"i was a big fan of this job the people o worked with each day were amazing, this job was not difficult and the hours were nice."
i would go back to this job if i ever had the chance
this bank employee for 3 years.
"Working at this bank was fun and challenging, but sometimes it got boring and didn't feel like there was room for advancement."
I would recommend starting your career at this bank
"High Stress, Low Loyalty."
"Sales, Sales, Sales."
"Be prepared to hear about Sales, Sales, Sales."
multiple times a day.
"Sales, Sales, Sales. say Sales, Sales, Sales."
"are more concerned with customer service, but the push day in day out is for sales."
Good company to work for..
The company has many career growth opportunities and promotes professional development.
Some departments offer a better work/life balance than others.
Good job.
I have worked here for almost a year now.
It can be very repetitive work experience but the money is good.
"For someone who was a full-time college student and had internship, I was able to balance it out."
They defiantly work with you especially if you are a student.
working there.
it was fun working here.
it was fun working there.
i had fun working there.
i would like everyone to work there.
i want to work back here so bad.
I found out i was pregnant
Stable Place to work.  
this bank provided great work life balance and job security.
this bank do not provide much as far as annual increases or bonuses.
this bank are very flexible with many work from home opportunities.
Do Not do It.
The recruiting is very misleading.
Management is clueless.
Only cares about production.
Expectations of the job extremely out weighs the compensation.
this bank is like most banks.
"Post Wells Fargo, the retail bank senior management has made things more difficult."
Too much Micromanaging from the top down.
There is overkill in tracking behaviors and results.
Stressful.
Started off great just that management lets management's personal issues get in the way of running the branch properly.
Can sometimes be unprofessional when dealing with hr and othet departments within this bank.
Great staff.
"Working there, everyone made it easy to work with ."
"Overall, I recommend this place to anyone who wants to work or continue to be a valued guest and customer,"
No real room for growth.
It would be a better place to work if the culture encouraged growth within the company versus bringing in management from outside the company.
Some position there are glass ceilings also.
Bank Teller.
Great company to work for.
Excellent management.
Banking just was not a part of my long-term career goals.
Enjoyed working in banking and growing and learning with Bank Teller..
Good Companyy.
Good job opportunity in retain banking.
Gives you opportunities to work with clients face to face and no day is the same.
Room for growth good.
Friendly employees
Very nice co

.
Ensure all daily banking transactions are completed.
Recognized excellent performer consistently.
over night being able to be off on Friday and Saturday
Drone work.
"i was not treated like a human being, my manager was a cardboard cutout."
"it was a nightmare i was hired to fill some bizarre quota which was ever changing, no feedback on work until, hey you aren't meeting the goals, there's the door."
Sure it's a good place to work for if you aren't on the low levels.
they roll their poo downhill
I would work there again.  
this bank is a strong employer to work for.
"What you put into this bank, is what you will get out of this bank."
Hard work is rewarded.
Advancement is available to those who seek Advancement.
Could be better.
"I was working here during the transfer from bank N to this bank, it was stressful time for everyone."
I imagine now that its been a couple of years things are better.
Not a lot support from Management.
"Everything was very good until I was told I needed to travel over 50 miles one way to work after working there for 3 years, I could not travel over 50 miles everyday so my position was eliminated."
"Not sure where the Manager was didn't see the Manager in the office much, so there was not much support."
Great company to work with.  
this bank was such a learning experience!
"I was given the opportunity to experience team work as well as leadership, team work as well as leadership are two traits that I will keep for the rest of my life!"
Great company.
Great company to work for.
They provide a great work life balance and respect their employees.
They provide the best environment for you to work and enjoy your career.
great place to work.
"I enjoyed the atmosphere, very team orientated."
realistic goals.
The pay was decent for the job.
The training was very extensive and very thorough.
The training was faced paced and you were always busy so the time flew by.
Amazing workplace.
This was my first banking job and i have no complaints.
this bank is staffed and managed to an exact point.
I am proud to say that this was my beginning.
Pave the path!
this bank.
Great place to start a career.
There are a lot of opportunities and for the most part you only have to be in one position for 6 months before applying to others.
Some of the departments are open 24 hours so you can find a shift that will work for you.
Compensation is offered in most positions and most positions will accommodate all disabilities.
Large Company.
"Family feel office, nice staff, advanced technology, benefits included, ever growing company, with growth potential, clean environment."
pay is not competitive
Hardknock life..
I did not have a good experience.
But you might.
Too much to balance.
No help.
It's find the answer on your own.
"Time between training is too long, managers don't manage."
The hours are terrible daily but federal holidays off.
Did not get along with 1 employee.
Got offered paid leave but resigned right on the spot.
Tue Turning employees into robots.
Extremely low pay for the stuff you put up with.
Care Center Role.
"Worked at this bank for 2 years, great place with plenty of upward mobility and opportunity."
few issues with payroll once or twice aside this bank
it is a work place culture.
work place culture and most enjoyable part of the job
.
"In addition, I've the experience of developing security policies, procedures, security baselines and work with various teams to enforce the security standards by incorporating the security standards in the SDLC process."
They are tripped up in nobody owns anything.
They are bogged down with too many committees and owners of everything to the point that noone can make a decision and they get stuck in analysis paralysis.
"However, all the leaders tell everyone about the progress all the leaders are making but the progress they are making is all vapor ware."
The head of tech and ops is the key to this mess and until The head of tech and ops leaves this will not change.
If The head of tech and ops doesn't like someone's opinion The head of tech and ops removes them.
Have seen several great leaders get pushed aside because several great leaders spoke several great leaders's mind.
Family type culture!!.  
this bank has the right focus at heart - the customer and the employee!
There is a collaborative team culture and a pride in the job that is exceptional.
There is a clear focus on improving the experience and doing that as a team across many lines of businesses.
"One does not succeed on their own at this bank, they succeed as a team."
"Fun place to work, Work and life balance."
Enjoyed working for the company overall.
the company takes care of the company's employees.
Excellent balance for work and family life.
"Incentives, bonuses, raises."
Overall nice place to work.
"The pay was nice, they did suprise bonuses for employees and this bank as a company had a pension."
this bank as a company is a great place to work.
Banking in general can be very competitive and catty so it just depends on who you work with.
"Some managers that are still there, are great."
Great Company but Regionals suck.
Great Company but Regional was very weak when it comes to Team management and motivation.
Overall the company was great.
Loved the CEO and Upper Management overall.
I believe message comes wrong when it comes to Regional managers Regionals need to grow within the this bank not from WELLS or other cultures...
Good work environment.
Good place to work.
Fast based culture and good people all around.
Stressful environment at peek intervals and there is complexity here.
"However, management is very engaged in what is going on and support."
Nice growth opportunity.
"The job is not my dream job, and I originally started working there out of high school part time to just get through life."
"Now, 6 years later I've been promoted a few times, gotten a lot of awesome life experience, and all around I've had a great time working there."
"Like i said, this wasn't my career goal, but the connections I've made, and the things I've learned are great."
Room to grow.
Low pay.
Micromanaged..
Very low pay for the work that you do.
Duties and responsibilities change everyday.
Too much paperwork.
Personnel changed constantly so you always felt short handed.
Ok.
NICE manganment.
Nice offices.
Good compensation.
Good personel.
There are areas of oppurtunity.
The branch needs to be given a little more power to make decisions.
Depends on the People.
"The company is pretty great, when I first started working at this bank I enjoyed it very much."
As time went on this bank got new people and it became similar to high school.
Poor Working Environment.
There is such a high turnover rate that nobody knows what they are doing.
If you are a newer employee and have a question and asked multiple people you will get a different answer from each person.
Branch reps call in constantly because Branch reps get very little training and Branch reps don't know what Branch reps are doing.
Customers are constantly angry because Customers get incorrect information from employees.
The management is extremely poor.
The coaches and mentors are even worse.
"This experience not only has me looking for a new job, but will also have me looking for a new bank."
Friendly environment.
Very Friendly environment and Professional co-workers.
I enjoyed working with Professional co-workers.
Also every body was very helpful.
"If anybody asking for any help, somebody step in right-way."
Overall great place.  
this bank pays well but closes a lot of branches so good people lose jobs.
Overall I think this bank was a great place to work.
The advancements were available if you want to drive great distance.
Great Place to work.
I enjoy working at this bank.
I have worked with a large variety of people at all levels and have gained a ton of knowledge.
this bank is big on community and that makes working there enjoyable.
Great work enviornment.
"Learned a lot, got along with the team and got the job done."
Was able to work from home permanently and it was productive.
We had our meetings over the phone.
Good place to work and good people to work with..
I enjoyed working at this bank.
Worked with a lot of good people.
Unfortunately I was only a contractor and my contract ended.
I wish that I could have been hired on as a full time employee.
I know I would have stayed with this bank for as long as possible.
Great company!.
"I have been employed by this bank for 2 years and like any company, this bank have transitions; no company is perfect and all transitions are not horrible."
"Honestly, it's up to the individual employee to determine if the individual employee will have a great day."
"If someone finds it difficult to see the good in any situation, they will not be satisfied anywhere they work In general, this bank has been good to me because I have been good to this bank."
"Although I have a lot going on in my life, I still manage to come to work with a positive attitudes."
"You get back what you give and if you are willing to give your best, others will see you shine and great things will happen for you and those who shine with you."
"this bank may not be for everyone, but I am doing the most with what I have with this bank and when it's time to transition to something new, I will still be proud to tell anyone that I've worked for this bank."
"Productive, fun pace to work.."
The workplace culture is very calm and enjoyable.
Coworkers are willing to help you along the way.
Questions forwarded to the management team are answered in a timely manner.
Do not like long term employees.
"Once this bank took over bank N in November 2009 and me being a long term top performing manager for 18 years calling off work only 6 days in my life, I met with my new manager for the second time."
my new manager let me go because my new manager felt that I lacked management skills.
Great !.
I loved my time with this bank!
The people you work with everyday are great.
this bank is different and cares about the employees and customers.
If I wouldn't have moved would stl be there.
Great Place to work.
I enjoyed working for this bank Mortgage.
"Had great management, team environment, and I felt this bank Mortgage were very understanding of work and family life balance."
"Can be stressful sometimes, but overall, great place to work."
A workplace to be proud of as an employee.
"A diverse workforce that employees feel valued, respected and proud of the work that is achieved daily."
"The company creates an environment of teamwork, integrity and quality of life."
Great employee benefit packages for employees and great quately incentive plans.
Childish environment.
"This company has so much potential and where 1 manager wants to care for all, 5 want to create and foster an environment of immaturity The whole universal model This companyve implemented in branches in which a personal banker does the job of a teller and a sales agent as well as an assistant manager yet only gets paid for one of the titles, is the most unsafe model EVER."
in the span of a few months a few branches (INCLUDING where I worked at before transferring) were robbed at gun point I am on my way out and wouldnt recommend working at any branch that has this universal model but overall i think This company means well and its just filled with too many people who care very little about others and just want to do whatever too many people who care very little about others and just want to do whatever they can to be liked by the higer ups can to be liked by the higer ups.
Terrific commercial bank.
I am grateful I began my career at this bank.
I worked with terrific mentors and developed a deep understanding of financial markets.
The culture is very team oriented.
Fun Workplace.
Great place to work the atmosphere was good as well as the co-workers.
Management really helped out with any questions.
The rewards program is awesome.
Great company.
It was a great place to work with co-workers and a manager (and actually other managers as well) there to give you support.
The training was not as good as The training should have been and on-the-job-training was hard to do with everyone with a client and not having someone to help you.
That slowed me down a bit.
"My branch was Universal, meaning you worked all aspects of banking."
"Teller, platform, and lobby."
"Great concept, but hard to do in reality."
"However, those that can be persistent and can close sales, you will make a boatload of money."
I loved helping customers.
I didn't like trying to sell to customers unless I knew it would help customers out.
"Banks are a business and I hate I couldn't be that person Banks wanted me to be, but Banks supported me and gave me all sorts of help in trying to make me a better banker."
I have no one to blame but myself.
Geat company with good pay and benefits and time off.
I would never have left if I could have succeeded the way Banks (and I) wanted me to.
Not Dependable Place to Work.
Management conducted an unorganized projects.
During the project was changes was not planned.
In the middle of the project Management laid off staff during the Holidays.
no good.
I think that a few this bank's are great and wonderful to work at but others are awful huge turn over rate and never enough staff to work at the other branchs we were always going from one location to another.
never a steady routine
Great company but work environment is not good..
Great company is a great company.
Great company embrace diversity.
"However, depending on the Branch, the management and employees can be very challenging."
"work environment can be full of gossip, back biting and judgement."
work environment's too bad because Great company is a really good one.
Good Company.  
this bank has been a great company to work for and is constantly changing to adapt to the new style of workforce.
Work from Home options are beginning to take place more frequently.
No pay raises.
They change your entire job.
no chance for advancement.
lack of communication.
Decision makers have no idea what job you do.
constant threats of discipline for mistakes
They gave me a chance to prove myself..
this bank is a good bank with decent products.
I was able to move up from a teller to a branch banker position within 1 year.
this bank is a very conservative bank.
"That being said, you never have to worry about a customer service scandal ripping your customer base away from you."
"Great benefits, not so great managers."
Culture is very typical chain down management but the benefits are great.
Vacation and pay are good but the people at the bottom are not always treated the same as 'higher up' positions are.
Benefits are good.
Free Parking at our loction.
Flexible work schedule.
Distance from home and work are nice..  this bank as a whole is a nice company to work.
"Benefits 401K, paid sick days, paid vacation days and holidays, HSA, and education benefits."
Management needs training on how to respect and treat Management's co-workers who are not Management's peers.
Professionally yet detached.
I liked this bank - I didn't see much chance for advancement and this bank offered little benefits.
"There was test office moral, however, little understanding during pregnancy as far as morning sickness, etc."
"Team orieneted, hard work but paid off."
I enjoyed working for the company.
I started off with a great manager that was willing to always help when needed.
Then ended my employment due to the new manager being too involved in personal life as opposed to the new manager's employees hitting numbers
friendly.  
this bank is a very easy company to work for.
the environment is very friendly and fast paced.
If you love helping people with people's finances this bank is the place for you!
Hostile Work Environment.  
this bank's management in my particular branch was incredibly mediocre and created a hostile work environment.
"Though I did my best to learn the skills necessary to be successful, it seemed as if my manager wanted me to fail."
Large organization with opportunity for advancement.
Pay is not that great..
Working for this bank gives you a lot of opportunity for internal advancement and helps you diversify your skills and experience.
"Also, this bank have offices in several states so you can move around the country within the job."
Management.
The management is supposed to be there to help The management's employees but at this bank
The management only help The management and no one else.
You are supposed to feel like you have a best friend while working there but all you get are back stabbers.
Head Teller.
"Working at this bank is just like working at any other commercial financial institution; fast, high energy, interacting with customers, making referrals and knowing this bank's products and service seeing that the teller is basically the face of this bank."
Best Place To Work.
"This was the best job I ever had, the only problem I had was that our compensation was extremely low for what we were doing."
Their safety procedures were great
"Solid company, positioned well in the industry."
Overall a nice place to work.
A leader in the industry.
Would recommend as a place to work.
Seasoned management willing to adapt to changes in the industry.
Every now and than new challenges.
It was fast paced job and learned how to deal with different kind of people and different kind of people's needs.
Management was very flexible but also kept us on our toes by giving different challenges.
Overall Management was fun place to work.
structured and routine.
I started as a teller for this bank and with this company i grew as much as i could until i had to move.
I loved the customer interactions and all that i learned with this company.
Productive fun work place.
I love my work place my work place's really nice good place to work.
Management is good Management give opportunity to people by looking your performance.
Love my supervisor
production oriented.
all about the numbers not a caring workplace.
"does not offer incentives or discounts of any type, just work your 8 hours and go home more like robots not people"
Productive Fun Work Place.
Learned a lot about banking.
"It was a great experience; however, for all the money Sales and Service Reps bring to the company through sales; the pay was too low; there was no where to go within the company if you worked in store; and a terrible work life balance; you work just about every weekend."
The hardest part of the job is that you were required to sell a certain amount of products that a lot of customers did not see the value.
This would be great experience for someone straight out of high school.
Great Company.
"Great place to work, room for growth and building your career."
"Lots of perks for employees, from free accounts to discounts on loans and education reimbursement."
management.
"Good company to work for to start off, the pay is good and there are several incentives but management is very unprofessional management lack good communication in several areas."
Management by Chaos.  
this bank Mortgage had an unusually top bottom way of managing...very prone to elitism and favoritism.
The atmosphere was not conducive to enjoying work and everyone seemed to feel they were at risk of job loss.
Transitional Issues.
Compensation/Benefits is poor.
Advancement opportunity is there but Compensation does not follow this bank is going though a system transformation and Job security is at question There has been a turnaround lately of quality workers (Subject matter experts).
"I have felt comfortable there for many years, Not so much as of late"
Way to much micro-managing.
Can't start processing until you are issued work each day; usually right at your start time.
If you start and are not signed in you will be terminated.
"Have to take specific breaks, whether you are in the middle of something or not."
"You are given vacation time, but are limited to when you can use vacation time, forcing you to turn days in at the end of the year."
Great people Latest Technology.
I really enjoyed myself working here at this bank.
Great team.
Great people.
Latest cutting edge technology.
Flexibility.
Career opportunity..
Work life balance.
If you like feeling that you are not good enough then work for this bank.
Where do I start.
Backstabbing people everywhere.
Its best to just keep your head down and do your work.
No such thing as loyalty.
Everyone is just looking our for themselves.
Horrible pay.
"Great people, great culture."
Great people at the firm with a very strong culture.
"Has the NY wall street work ethic with the Midwestern DNA, which is unique at a firm and hard to find."
Fun and Productive.  
"this bank offers great incentives when you reach your goal, and offers strategies on how to achieve your goal."
this bank offer great benefits and allow you to work from home.
Horrible.
Working there was horrible.
I never had been so stressed in my life.
You are a machine to them and they don't care.
You have to work forced overtime which they have the right to take back.
If you live close to their I guess that wouldn't be a problem but if you commute back and forth from the city it can be quite time consuming.
They are a 24/7 operation yet there is no flexibility.
Everyone talks about everyone and the only way to move up is to best friends with a supervisor or manager.
"Turnover was high when I was there at about 35%, I left three years ago and I 've heard Turnover's higher than about 35%."
As people come in the door people are going out.
"Great place to work, but compensation could be better.."
Typical day at work is ensuring your customer's's financial well-being is taken care of as well as your customer's have all that your customer's need.
"Daily operations of servicing accounts and dealing with all type of people and cultures, adjusting to customers needs and manners."
Great company for learn new things.
A typical day at work is fast.
I verify the income for the underwriters and sometimes have to help in some of the underwriter duties.
"I verify all types of income from military, retirement, self employed and wage."
great place to work.
Typical Day:
Fast pace What I learned: How to manage my time wisely.
Management:
Great Person always willing to work with me.
Workplace Culture: WE are all different and are allowed to express that.
Hardest Part Of The Job: Getting everyone to work together as a tea The most enjoyable part of The Job: Being able to go home at the end of the day knowing you have accomplished what you set your goall for in the morning
Banking is the same anywhere.
"Banking was fun when I first started but more and more Banking became mostly about pushing clients into opening accounts and applying for services that were completely unneeded, simply for the fact that each employee has to reach a certain number of accounts on a monthly basis."
Banking is more about reaching goals and hitting certain numbers rather than actually getting to know your clients and really following your clients through into the directions your clients need to go.
"Many times if you didn't reach your goals at the end of the month, you would have to pull an all-nighter making phone calls to clients with a nice savings account and beg clients with a nice savings account to come in and turn some of that cash into a frozen long-term account."
It was dreadful.
Fine.
Was able to learn and grow.
Advancement available if desired.
Technology is growing with the times.
And customer service is priority.
"Benifeits are desirable such as health, life, dental insurance as well as retirement options"
expect to be sales people.
Want you to cross sell and push products on a constant basis.
Want you to cold call customers to sell products and services.
I do not feel cold call is a teller's job.
cold call is for management.
Best team i had..
"I had an amazing team, learnt a lot."
Amazing Manager.
Wonderful experience.
Very flexible timings and one of the best leads I had at work.
Definitely an amazing work place.
Depends on what you do!.
"It's not a family oriented culture like it was when bank N was the company, bank N took care of bank N's employees and now that bank"
N's this bank bank N only take care of the Executive.
Too busy for training.
"head first dive into commercial property management, be sure its a right fit prior to taking commercial property management on, good people, company and team dynamic is difficult to maneuver for new employees."
good work life balance.
great work life balance and good for starting off in banking.
Hours are not bad a typical 9-5 work day.
All work is usually done within the office hours.
"Great diversity, strong support by management.  "
this bank is a great company to work for.
This has been my first 'adult' job starting out and the tools this bank give you to learn the material is fantastic.
"A typical day at work starts at 8:30am and if you close, ends at about 5:45/6PM."
Management is fabulous and how the branches come together as a team is fantastic.
"Great company,Great growth environment within the company.."
"Excellent benefits,friendly environment,great opportunities to gro with the company and achieve your desired position."
Fun activities and great management .
Never enough.
You can never do enough at this job.
Always require more.
Compensation is terrible.
They call it needs based selling but they want you to product push everything to everyone.
resolve customer bank issues.
resolved issues with bank card transactions.
helped with troubleshooting online acces helped with refunding for overage helped to guide customers on the right account types for customers
"Overall, not the worse place to work.."
I've worked in both the retail and operations of this bank.
this bank provide you the tools to meet your goals.
Its your choice to participate in employee engagement opportunity which this bank do provide.
I participated in several this bank outtings and enjoyed my time to meet people in different departments.
Always great to put yourself out there and network.
"Overall, not a bad place to work."
A horrible company.
While working at this bank I experienced a lot of different changes.
When i originally applied I was told my job wouldnt be focused on sales.
When i got hired in about a month in thats all this bank focused on and my job was even threatened if I didn't pick up my sales.
this bank.
"If you're looking for a place to work, this is a place to work!"
this bank offer great benefits.
Its very hard to advance.
this bank offer great quality training.
The culture varies depending on you job
"Not Bad, Not Great."
Training is mediocre and a lot of times you are just thrown into your position with little to no help from another branch employee.
"Pay is just OK, benefits are decent."
Good benefits and okay pay.
Overall nice but not enough pay for me with all the stress on sales goals and tracking sales.
Management and staff are nice and very professional and willing to help you advance but you have to want a career selling.
Unpleasant work enviroment..
Uncomfortable and overly demanding work environment.
Human resources unpleasant to deal with.
An environment that did not promote internal promotions.
not a good place to work.
I would rather not say a whole lot of negative about this company.
but i will say to use this company as a stepping stone and get out.
take your experience elsewhere.
Felt like a lot of turnover in 1 year.
"As an underwriter, the work life balance is not comparable to larger corporations unless you are hired to work from home which many underwriters do at this bank."
Great Company.
"Good company that promotes diversity on all levels, strong foundation of customer service and client interaction."
Large institution with a small town feel.
The most work balanced company to work for.. the management was wonderful the management helped you strive to better your self.
The culture was wonderful but the hardest part of the job was meeting the dead lines.
okay place to work.
If you are not a favorite they do not care about you.
They do not have your back and for the most part it is like being in high school.
"I loved high school at first but as time went on, I became miserable."
very competitive/ sales oriented.
I was part of a bank that was acquired by this bank.
"Subsequently, I left a bank that was acquired by this bank."
this bank is great for people that need to be managed constantly.
this bank is very rigidly structured and you know exactly how to arrange your desk and what should be worked on at what time of the day.
"If you are in need of structured guidance, this bank is the place for you."
Awesome establishement.
A wonderful working environment for those who love working in banking institutions.
It is definitely a great working environment with wonderful co-workers.
Most enjoying part of the job is the people and the working environment.
Awesome place to work!.  
this bank was great to me.
"Earned incentives, management was always caring and understanding, the culture was contagious with all positivity."
"Nothing waste difficult to accomplish, management always gave employees enough time and gave employees the tools to reach employees's goals."
Good Company to Work for.
Overall this was a good place to work but due to moving I needed to find something closer to home.
My manager was fantastic but the cons is that the departments didn't work well as a team combined.
I didn't want to leave.
Some of the greatest people work at this bank.
By now all the former bank N way of thinking has been weeded out or brought to it's knees.
"I didn't want to leave, but change came."
Worked for this bank a long time things change time to move on.
"Originally this bank was a great place to work, things change ( people, ideas, ect. ), met a lot of great people in my time there long gone now, like a lot of Companies out with the old in with the new."
Licensed Branch Financial Sales Consultant.

great.
collections sucked but this place was great!
I met the best friends.
I always felt supported to do well.
There was always training.
Always intervention before you're in trouble.
police comes into company parking lot to run plates and give tickets while you're' working.
police'll tow you.
Good work environment.
"Although the pay could be a lot better, the work environment is very good."
Employees work together to provide an outstanding customer experience.
I would recommend this company.
Dealing with problems.
Your are dealing with individuals who have encountered banking issues.
Whether it is a matter of an overdrawn account or problems accessing individuals who have encountered banking issues's account on line you are the first person people call.
Financial/ Sales.
Working for this bank is an in store environment is not the typical banking work environment.
You do a lot of sales and selling products.
Mostly customer interactive and pushing this bank products
Decent Job.
Job is okay there's a lot of room for advancement.
The pay can suffice in the beginning but you'll eventually make more as long as you switch departments.
If you like taking calls all day and sitting down Job may be the perfect fit for you
Good Job.
Good people to be around when I was at my branch in Philadelphia.
The hours were challenging but I enjoyed my time there.
The days were exciting and the idea of reaching my sales goals always helped me.
Good company.
Fabulous management.
Financial management group is the best team ever that I have work for.
"Job work life balance is superb, compensation and benefit not bad at all."
Financial management group and excellent job culture
sit at desk on phones all day non stop collecting long hours.
get on ur computer get everything brought up an ready for calls weekly meetings daily huddles inbound and outbound calls.
collecting for their mortgages payments if past due set up repay plans or get them further assistant.
hardest part is sitting in a chair for like 10 hours.
some management is more helpful than other earn monthly bonues
Management.
"Management wants to tell you what you need to be doing, instead of helping out when you need it and there is a definite lack of leadership at my branch."
Good Company.
Good Company but just like most institutions very sales driven.
Good work / life balance and 'Bankers Hours'.
Good for family life but there is an expectation of production.
Overall pretty great place to work..
Overall this bank is a great company to work for.
There really isn't a 'typical' work day which can help to keep you engaged and make you want to keep going.
Management for the most part does what Management can to assist you in reaching your goals and ultimately getting where you want to go.
The people are great that you work with and it is one of the things that keeps me coming to work everyday.
The hardest part of the job is working with so many different personalities and working on your employees development while trying to work on your own at the same time.
Good community investment program.
Regulatory environment has changed banking for the worse.
Lack of local decision making and reduction of commissions and bonuses have created an undesirable appetite for high performing sales people to remain in banking.
Very helpful.
The entire staff was amazing and helpful.
"The entire staff would push you to do sales, which I would never have expected for a bank teller."
The entire staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.
If you ever had a question The entire staff would go above and beyond to help you.
overall a great place to devlop skills and experience.
Processing loan transactions throughout the business day.
"I have learned there are many components to reviewing loan transactions, The management is quite involved with assuring the best delivery to external and internal customers, The workplace culture can be fun and enjoyable with monthly activities."
"The hardest part of the job, sometimes lack sufficient training time."
"The most enjoyable part of the job, is the opportunity to move within the company to another position, depending on your acquired skill set."
Good work life balance.
Bank hours.
Systems are like going back in time to the stone age.
Management is clueless in what is going on.
Anyone from tellers to Divisional management are miserable at Anyone from tellers to Divisional management's jobs.
Work Hard.
"Long hours, you have to learn how to listen and understand what the clients require."
"the clients get very aggressive and expect things from you, you cant give things."
But still be successful and handle it proffessionaly.
Very stressful
sometimes
but if you concentrate and stay focus you will get used to it.
The staff are very polite and nice to work with.
This company concentrates on more selling/retail of products over customer service!.
Very stressful high pressure tactics over sales and not enough compensation for employees and a lot of favoritism toward some employees when it came to time off.
I did meet and develop some great relationships with some of the main customers.
Some of the things you were trained to do were constantly changing and the even how you were compensated were constantly changing.
very challenging.
This was a very nice place to work which allowed me to experience and share many technical issues/problems and solutions.
I was here as a consultant but would love to come back as an employee.
Entry Level Job.
This is my first entry level job and it has been a great experience.
Great job stability along with compensation for a recent college graduate.
Would recommend to anyone wanting to get into finances.
Good company to work for.
Many opportunities within the company for career advancement.
Culture and management is great.
I have learned a lot and met a lot of great people.
The downside is that a lot of opportunities are centralized to states like PA.
Stressful Work Environment.
This Job was very stressful as This Job required you to be on the phone all day.
"We used an automatic dialing system, so the calls never stopped, and most of the conversations were argumentative."
"This Job was a collections job, so you were calling customers to pay customers's debts to the bank."
Great Environment.
A typical day at work starts by reviewing my email inbox and checking my voicemails.
"After that, I determine what pressing issues need addressed and prioritize my work."
"I have learned an extensive amount about loans, lines of credits, trusts, estates, and wills."
I have dealt directly with clients and internal employees.
sucks the life out of you.
Nothing close to a work life balance.
Realtors are the worst calling you 24/7.
"the over time you work you are not compensated on, they are coming out of the 2nd lawsuit for violation of this as we speak"
"Great place to advance, too much micromanaging."
The base pay for the work load is way too low.
"What is initially expected of you can change within months, if not weeks."
They lack diversity in management positions.
"Uncaring, no compassion, and hard work for low salary."
This was something that I had to honestly think about before doing my review.
I worked for 12 years for this bank and was a Teller Lead for 5 of 12 years.
"At first I absolutely loved my position, helping the branch and fellow team with audits, trading the tellers to learn and grow and helping this bank's customers Somewhere along the way in the last year or so heavy product pushing, sales, sales , sales and all about numbers took over."
The teller leads are doing the job of a manager but getting paid like a teller and if all your tellers are not performing then you are not either.
"It became tougher and tougher and the hours and time that you put in, along with the 100 things you have to maintain and balance are not worth it!"
"Okay,,, for short term.  "
this bank hou are in as changed over the years that I have been there.
"If school and need a job while you are getting an education, this bank hou is a great place to work as the staff at branch level is usually very nice."
But with advancement opportunities being limited I would not recommend this bank hou for a career.
A focused work environment.
A typical day was visiting my business customers and determining if my business customers's accounts were in order and reviewing my business customers's current products to see if my business customers are best serving my business customers's needs.
I would try to visit at least 8-10 bank customers per day and always make time for cold calls .
The hardest part of the job was to convince the customer that the customer needed more of anything.
Goals were tough for everyone to achieve based upon your area.
this bank was the most technologically advanced company I ever worked for.
You had to be on your game and computer literate to keep up with this bank's technology .
this bank was ahead of this bank's time.
this bank.
"Horrible Company to work for, this bank is so disorganized and doesn't have the client's best interest at heart."
this bank's polices are a joke and this bank don't offer adequate training for this bank's new hires.
great bank for customers.
the banking industry has changed from service to retail.
I believe we lost the value of customer service by making the bank a retail store.
without talking bad about the bank or the bank I rather keep my comments to my self.
Great place to get into banking.
Work/life balance was great.
"Enjoyable atmosphere, and a great way to network with regular customers."
"I worked on both the teller side and the banking side of the branch, and enjoyed both aspects of branch banking."
Always looking to help you learn and advance.  
"this bank is a great working environment, fun staffed and this bank are willing to help you progress to reach your fullest potential."
My only wish is that the pay wasn't low for the job required.
Good for home work balance and benefits.
I have been with this bank for 16 years and this bank have good health benefits and when my children were little a good home work balance.
The flexibility for family is great.
There is always something new to learn and the management team is willing to help you move forward into other positions.
The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility.
The hardest part of the job are the audits.
fast pace work place.
send and receive calls try to get people to pay on there loans.
get people set up for modifications.
set up payments.
set up ext.
set up payment arrangements
Financial Specialist.
Developed new investment client base while prospecting current book of bank clients as well as conducting investment seminars.
Key Achievements: Garnered recognition as a top revenue producer in Philadelphia/South Jersey/Delaware region.
Completed first quarter 2012 as top revenue producer within Philadelphia market.
Work life balance.
Poor work life balance for managers of this bank in the Northern MI area.
Managers and employees are expected to produce high sales results in a low income area.
"Nice place to work, nice people and culture."
"Nice place to work, nice people and culture."
"Very conservativ product offering portfolio, more than most other firms I have worked for in the past."
Good Bank Poor Management.  
"this bank is a great place to bank, I still bank with this bank."
"this bank, with a company who prefers to hire outside a company who prefers to hire outside the company then promote within then promote within."
a company who prefers to hire outside the company then promote within have good insight and promote the brand well.
"Fun, problem solving position with room to grow.."
Working with customers to ensure customers have an exceptional experience brings me great joy.
This position has enabled me to grow and develop new skills.
Good work environment.
"Learned about Real Estate, Appraisals and Evaluations."
Entered information regarding properties.
Review pictures of properties when applying for HEIL or HELOC
decent.
"not very flexible in work hours, high expectations for employees to open accounts and recruit new clients in a very low income/dead area, low pay with high expectations"
this bank.
Good company to work for.
Good benefits and fair pay.
this bank has a professional atmosphere.
"Good management, managers are open and will to help employees grow and develop."
"Do not waste your time working in this bank Customer Service Dept.. Rushed training, management is cutthroat."
"If your really good on the phones in the first day of training outside of the classroom this bank Customer Service Dept keep you, otherwise forget ever moving into the role of Customer Service Representative."
"this bank Customer Service Dept claim this bank Customer Service Dept are experts in whether your going to be bad or good on the phones the first day and if you are slow learning the 15-20 screens you need to know, this bank Customer Service Dept cut you immediately."
Also you can't get the vacations you asked for because your last in line so new training classes are not going to get requested time off.
"this bank Customer Service Dept also ask you to open a new bank account one week into classroom trading, don't do it."
"If this bank Customer Service Dept cut you, close a new bank account immediately."
"Also there is no accountability at the whole company as there is no complaint resolution, except for a call center."
If you have a problem with management or management treat you unfairly expect more of the same as upper management rubber stamps lower management decisions.
Not a good company to work for.
great place to work.
great place to work right after college.
this bank will invest in your training and development unfortunately your pay will not reflect your training.
Best advice learn all you can and find a job with a competitor.
you have fun at work.
I had a blast working with office I was at.
We treated each other like family.
No one was bossy when the Manager was out of the office.
We knew what was expected of us and we got the job done.
My Experience at this bank.
My experience was great.
this bank is a great company.
this bank are very informative and detailed in regards to this bank's training.

This company sold my division to BNYMELLON.
BNYMELLON was a good company with good benefits and decent pay.
BNYMELLON take sufficient care of BNYMELLON's employees and contractors.
"Fast paced, lots to learn quickly."
"If you want to work for a bank, the ACCEL Program is the best way to get into a management role."
You have to learn a lot really quickly and you will have a lot of mentors your first year
this bank.
My main job was to handle all money transactions from customers and sell products.
"When not working with customers, I was required to use online learning tools to learn more about my job."
this bank Great Place to Start but bad place to work.  
this bank allowed me to get the adequate training that I needed to get started in the banking industry.
I would recommend this bank to anyone getting started but not a good place to work overall.
Lots of Micromanagement.
was a great place to work.
"I had a great experience at this bank , I had great management we opened up daily at 8:30 and closed at 5:30 each day , first thing in the morning we opened our cash drawers and counted our money , opening the night drop vault ,then we checked in all of the commercial night drops, opened the doors for business , I enjoyed my customers very much , and working in close contact with the other tellers I became very close to the other tellers it was like working in a family."
"When I first became a teller it was all new to me so some of the things were a little difficult but with repetition I learned how to use all the machines , I would say up selling was my hardest learned skill I did well with it"
"but it was difficult,"

Customers were the focus point of the business.
I made many great relationships with my customers and enjoyed interacting and servicing my customers's financial needs.
Good Company to start with.  
this bank is a good company to start off with if you are entering the banking industry.
Unfortunately there is a lot of 'politics' in this bank.
In the position that I am in now (Intl trade service analyst)
I am not payed nearly enough.
I do my daily responsibilities and they add responsibilities of another department.
There are a lot of changes in corporate right now and things are a bit messy.
Great benefits.  
this bank was a great place to work.
this bank have wonderful benefits and many ways in which to advance in the corporation.
I would recommend this bank to anyone wanting to get into the banking business.
Changing enviornment.
The job has changed a lot recently.

not able to write review review.
"not able to write review..................................................... I have had a great experiences at this bank.. culture with people are great , management is awesome"
Not the best.
Not an employee first company as an employee first company as they strive to be strive to be.
"Upper leadership is lacking as well as pay and opportunities for growth, this is regardless of your skill set"
Technology leader and promotes work life balance.
I enjoy coaching sales employees to be the best sales employees can be and provide our customers with financial success.
I also enjoy coaching and leading the management teams to empower the management teams to be great coaches.
great work place.
I loved working at the bank.
i got t meet a lot of different people.
i also was able to do some networking while i was there.
the days there went by pretty fast as long as you had something to do.
the staff there for the most part was awesome
Interesting but enjoyable work atmosphere..
The hardest part of the job as with any csr position is handling the irrational customers.
Sometimes situations cannot be resolved with only one interaction.
Thumbs Down.
Company does not compensate well for all expectations.
Company expect you to do the work for 3 individuals and only want to pay you for 1/2 of 1.
If the compensation was greater it would not be so bad.
Fun great people.
Very challenging job not much to really say about Very challenging job.
Very challenging job is great if you don't have a family with small children.
It is very high passed you must be sure you pay attention to detail.
You must remember your customers and who your customers are.
I have learned all kinds of things working at the bank.

We were a highly prized department.
What I Learned.
"Learned how to process, pre-underwrite (DU-LP Seasoned), and package and submit my loan up-coming loan fundings."
Gave me an understanding of how FDIC Mortgage Banks work and operate.
Not bad.
Not bad if you like big companies.
New talent and job structure is a bit confusing to understand.
"Meager annual raises, but improved vacation time off."
Medical insurance seems to be pretty standard and rather affordable.
"Can move up or around after one year, but as mentioned, the new structure makes it confusing and can lead to large discrepancies in salaries for the same job"
Fun workplace with great management and structure.
I love the culture at this bank.
The work/life balance is something you don't see all of the time.
this bank value the employees and understand that a happy employee creates a comfortable environment and in turn satisfies customers.
Was a great place to work.
"Daily monitored Cash Account Balances and Securities Balances, reporting to management and back office on any overdrafts and follow up to clear overdrafts and breaks on securities I became very good at multi-tasking in order to meet hourly deadlines."
"I don't think any parts of the job were hard, but sometimes overtime became excessive."
The most enjoyable part would be clearing a break and finding a solution to prevent the same types of breaks in the future.
Great place to work.
Was extremely happy working for company.
Advancement is always a possibility as long as you are not working for the actual branches.
Branches of bank are less and less important.
Overall Good Place to Work.
12-14 hour days in this bank's Securitization group.
Management very interested in your career growth.
Friendly workplace.
Strong training program
Great place to work but needs improvement.
I have been here for 2 years and I have had the opportunity to move up.
It is a great employer however there are areas that need improvement.
Management on the retail can be difficult and moving up can be challenging.
fun workplace.
Best job to have while satisfying client needs.
But the manager there was very weird and iffy.
Always kept asking questions that do not pertain to the job and making a lot of excuses.
Not work/life friendly.
May be good atmosphere for less seasoned employees.
Not a professional environment for seasoned individuals.
Good for just out of high school building a career.
Excellent company to work for that focuses on talent development and work/life balance.
I have completely enjoyed my time with this bank.
this bank have maintained and excellent focus on work/life balance and encourage every employee's development.
this bank provide ample opportunity for learning and volunteering.
"Management is fair and respectful, and also concerned about each employee's development and job satisfaction."
Streessful work enviorment.
The branch i was at was hostle but the people are nice in thier own way the hours are reasonable but in terms of hours the people expect so much from the workers for very.
Little benifit
Loved the work/life balance.
"Management style changes with every new manager, some good and some terrible."
I enjoyed the diversity of customers and employees.
I think the hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset when asked for customers's ID.
"We only ask to help prevent identity fraud, so it is a protection we are trying to provide."
A Changed Bank.
Used to be a great place to work.
"I no longer am there, but so much has changed and I feel that they no longer value their employees as much as they did in the past."
Great Place to work.  
this bank is great for a work place to learn and grow with.
You will learn a lot about banking and to grow with a team.
Meeting other co workers from other branches makes you value the company you work for.
this bank is a great work place for single mothers and this bank are a huge supporter of our military and even the LBGT community.
N/a. Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions.
"Assist Small Business clients on policy and procedures to make banking easie Answered telephone inquiries on banking products including checking, savings, credit cards, loans, and lines of credit Communicate with service partners to efficiently assist with problem solving and service request by providing accurate information efficiently to conserve time Continued education on current banking products and services through online banking."
this bank Review.  
this bank is a great career starter.
Although this bank's branch is located in a small town its a good way to gain experience when it comes to skills and building relationships with this bank's customers.
this bank.
Love the work environment a typical day for me was verifying that funding was cleared to be submitted to the following parties.
"I reviewed all the documentation from the title company and the borrower, buyer and seller."
Productive and enjoyable.
Strengthening relationships with customers while helping customers make the most of customers's finances.
Continual learning about new banking practices and how to help customers.
Interaction with customers.
Servicing customers with financial issues as well as selling customers with financial issues different products.
I learned over years to love people and interact with people as far as there financial needs is concern.
The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve people's financial issues because of fees restrictions and have to tell people that I could not assist people by refunding fees.
I enjoyed most to be able to resolve any financial issues that were within my parameters.
To see people leave satisfied and happy with my services.
Productive but corporate heavy.
"It was a great place to work, but the corporate presence was too much."
They want you to migrate business to the ATM's but then see reports of lesser traffic to the teller line and feel as though our job is not good enough.
Job security A+.
Compensation D-.
Some coworkers are professional and respectful than others.
"Some coworkers's policies change all the time, hence you tend to make a lot of mistakes."
"Some employees do not get compensated for working overtime, and also do not get compensated annually, but are expected to work overnight."
Great place to grow.
Great place for advancement and great training program.
Great for anyone looking to balance work and family life.
There are plenty of opportunities to grow and make extra money with overtime and bonus checks.
same as other review about this bank.
The same as the other review the I submitted regarding this bank and the call center that I worked in.
Fast pace environment.
Learned a lot about banking.
Enjoyed working with customers and resolving customers's problems.
Supervisor for a call center for customer calls..
Answered calls for customers regarding customers's account as well as products and services the this bank provided.
I learned a lot about banking.
"The hardest part of the job was the volume of calls a call center for customer calls took daily, The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
this bank.
It was nice working from home with the banking industry.
Talking to customers and solving the problems of every day calls.
Online banking tech support.
third shift job.
Had to key in various checks to accounts during the night so accounts would be credited with accounts's money by the next banking day.
very routine schedule
good job enough incom for any single person and simple environment .. friendly people good management nice workplace culture and good system to learn how can you developing your skills fast working and successfully achieving the company goal with time to enjoyable in your department operations .
Wish I stayed.
I've never had a job where I left and I regretted it not even a month later.
I had to leave because I unfortunately wasn't getting paid enough.
"The staff, managers, and regional managers are absolutely amazing."
"Always very helpful, very nice and understanding."
"Not only did this job give me the opportunity to meet amazing people, but this job gave me life skills that I will carry on with me for the rest of my life such as leaning how to balance a check book, manage not only my bank account, but large amounts of money as well."
"this job taught me security and how to be careful with bank account information, how to apply for a loan, how to manage a loan, how to apply for a credit card, how to manage credit cards, mortgages, how to apply for one, what's expected when applying for a mortgage, the process, etc."
The hardest part of this job is watching out for scam artists.
Some people aren't as nice and honest as you think.
"Customers will come in trying to be someone else with fake IDs, you will run into TONS of counterfeit money, but learn how to catch counterfeit money, and managing thousands of dollars all at once."
You definitely have to learn how to keep track of counterfeit money at all times.
"There's a lot of security and procedures you have to learn in case of a robbery as well, but as long as you know what you're doing at that moment, you will be fine."
great place to work at.
good place to work at the training part is very exciting !!!
they send you to a hotel and give you a free stay !
great transition
It is an ok type of a company.
The work experience isn't great but not bad either.
"Being banking domain there is less flexibility and workers have to put in more than 100%.There is no freedom of thought , the processes aren't flexible."
High turn over rate.
A lot of people started to leave once A lot of people changed A lot of people's compensation plans.
"this bank Mortgage changes A lot of people's compensation plans all to often, along with withdrawal requirement."
Learning experience.
The customers are your most important part of your day.
Excellent customer service.
If The customers are happy with your service everything else just falls in place
Business and Sales workplace.
Working for this bank has taught me a lot about money management and being able to help the customers as well.
As a teller our job is to also meet certain sales goals.
Not many employees like working for this bank.
I never got the feeling that anyone actually knew what they were supposed to be doing at this bank.
Not sure if this is because the constant cost cutting or because of the mergers of 08-09.
the mergers of 08-09 made most people stressed out.
The benefits and vacation were pretty good.
its ok.
CIQ is the most important factor!!
you have to up-sell every single customer..
CIQ pay you 8 dollars and 50 cent starting as a teller!!
you however do get a home life
Good learning experience.
I overall approve working for this company.
You learn a lot about money management and up-keeping customer's financial well being
They don't care about their employees.
"The customers were great and the other teller was wonderful, higher management sucks"
and they do not care about their employees at all.
Work Life Baance is high quality.
"Company is employee friendly and believes in quality of life and a true work life balance, Employee development is encouraged and supported at all levels."
Each employee is provided the opportunity to do Each employee's best each day
"Filled with intelligent, diverse employees."
Loved this work!.
"I thoroughly enjoyed working at this bank Mortgage, but there was no room for advancement for me there."
My co-workers were intelligent people who were kind and so much fun.
My Operations Manager was awesome.

Fulfilling and challenging career.  
this bank is a great place to be employed.
You have so many opportunities for advancement.
There is great training involved and you get to work with a lot of amazing people while helping customers with there every day banking needs.
Respectable place to work at.
It takes hardwork and teamwork to survive here..
The boss will appreciate and reward extra hours and efforts that you put into work.
Its very enjoyable yet the most challenging place I've worked at.
It was worth it.
Exciting and Productive work enviroment.  
this bank management works with bank management's employees on the daily.
From the moment you are hired management begins to assist you with your future goals with bank management giving bank management's employees the opportunity to advance.
"management is also very cooperative with school schedules, therefore if you going to school while working on moving up in bank management bank management is a great place to be."
"Great medical benefits, relaxed atmosphere..  "
this bank is a great place to work.
this bank are flexible with your hours and you can also work from home.
this bank's benefits package is top notch.
"What didn't work for me was that my entire team was located out of state, so I didn't have the daily face-to-face interaction with this bank that you would normally have with a location-centric team."
this bank do have a company shuttle that goes to Pittsburgh.

"Everyone within the bank are team players, always professional and assertive."
Overall the bank's a great bank to work for!
Great Work Place.
"Great Work Place, environment was productive."
Great management team.
Great pay.
Most enjoyable part of the job was working around different customers.
Great corporate company but retail banking is lacking.  
this bank is an advanced company with great benefits.
The pay is very low in comparison with other banks and for what you are expected to do.
It is a pushy sales environment because that is the only way employees can make any extra money.
great benefits are great except for the health insurance.
The sales nature of this bank puts employees in competitive situations which causes a lot of drama in the branches.
People are fighting over referrals and doing unethical things to make more money.
Management encourages this because Management's bonus is based off of the branches referrals.
Management are not qualified.
Just because you have a degree does not mean that you are a good leader.
The turnover rate would be lower if Management actually invested in Management's employees.
But you can't do that when the branches are always short staffed because the branches don't pay enough.
Great Place to Work.
i learned a lot about Customer Service.
i learned how to different with various personalities while working at this bank.
this bank also offered a lot of opportunities for advancement.
i have nothing to say.
"the job was great, regular working hrs."
Day or nights hrs will vary btw to shifts 8-5pm or 12-9pm.
the job consist on an hourly pay and there is commission involved if production is met.
NO HARD PART.
unless you don't like talking on the phne.
Managements awesome.
Managements are there to help you move forward.
Easy going Environment but with no Pay Raises EVER.  
this bank is more interested in this bank's efficiency ratio than in retaining this bank's employees.
There are no inflationary raises and barely every merit raises.
"You will be looking at less than inflation, unless you are in a selling role."
better than average.
While the overall organization is better than most big banks there have been multiple compensation changes and downsizings in the last year.
"Engaging, client centric enviroment..  this bank is a very strong company with a solid foundation for building and developing leaders."
"A very engaging, client centric environment that fosters creativity."
Balance.
"Working for this bank was good for the most part, I think every job will not be that perfect job, but you take the good with the bad, look forward and not back, do your job to the best of your ability."
People Who Care
But Are Not Cared For.
"Work life balance is miserable, the department is under-staffed, pay is too low to incentivize people to stay, trainers are overwhelmed with constant new hires and floor-level managers are far more stressed than floor-level managers should be because upper management keeps pushing for floor-level managers to have good performance despite floor-level managers's undertrained staff."
Training timetables are repeatedly rolled back to have enough people on the phones and it noticeably affects the quality of the work.
The incentive to perform is based on avoiding things you will be punished for rather than bonuses for meeting or beating goals.
"Again, the pay for the work is laughable, there are factory jobs in town requiring no computer skills or extensive training that pay as much or better than this position."
Upper management is utterly unwilling to invest in the base-pay and number of staff necessary to keep the call center operating as intended.
"If you're going to be temporarily 'stuck' someplace it's better than a minimum wage job, by far, but for any kind of substantive, appreciable career-type job it falls depressingly short as an employer."
"Everyone in town seems to know someone who worked there, and Everyone in town do, because the rate of turnover is so high just about everyone in town -has- worked there."
A better place to be from than to be at.
Overall veiw.
Really good company to be employed with.
They are very conservative in some areas of the company.
As a Bank they do not take a lot of risk when it comes to advancing and staying up to date with technology.
Company Culture Lacking/ Unable to Retain Talent.
Culture of the company in Florida branches needs vast improvement if the company in Florida branches wish to keep talent.
"My experience was not enjoyable working for this bank, and I hope this bank can find more empathetic leaders in the Florida area."
Room for Advancement.
Great company to work for if your looking to get experience in banking and finance.
this bank offers room for advancement if you work hard enough and are willing to put in the work.
Good Place to Work.
"If you work hard, you can advance in your career."
Company focuses on Work life Balance and Diversity.
Company has a lot of programs and training to assist you in your career development.
Great Place.
Great place to work.
Ability to work well with others and grow within the company.
Hours were great and willing to work overtime too.
Enjoyed working with all the people that I was managing
Great place to work.
"This company is great to work for, but I am having trouble finding a way up the ladder."
This company does many things for This company's employees through out the year.
"Some people like working at this bank, and some don't.."
"In the corporate environment, the higher up you go, the more competitive it gets, even though the company this bank tries to promote diversity and recognition."
I suppose this could hold true for many companies.
"I have little knowledge of what working for the retail side of this bank is like, however."
A good place to work for the most part.
I was a vault attendant.
I had to make sure that our employees had enough money to work with all day and I had to balance the vault daily.
I was also a customer service representative assisting our customers with the best service I could give our customers.
"Answering questions about our customers's accounts, focusing on giving our customers what our customers needed most whether it is a up-grade on our customers's checking account, an IRA for the future or just listening to what our customers's needs were."
It was a very difficult job at times when we were busy because I needed to be there for our employees not our customers.
Call Center Environment.
Call center environment with high turnover.
Decent pay but micromanagement by managers.
Not a bad place to work.
Forced to sit in your desk from 9-5.
Great.
Salary so..so..Company that offers positions in most to the east coast.
Fast pace environment with challenges that push you to develop and grow.
Loved the clients.
challenges that push you to develop and grow is the hours you may be scheduled.
Enjoyable is they are about the clients financial well-being.
Productive.
"The joy of sharing the investment knowledge with the customers that asking for the information, informing the customers that asking for the information of how to invest for the future"
this bank.
I worked in a Branch inside Giants.
The only thing I disliked about working for this bank was the compensation.
I think this bank deserved higher pay annually.
They do not push goals so hard but you still have to meet your goals.
My manager was awesome!
Working in a Branch inside Giants you had to go into the aisles and talk to customers who were really focused on getting customers who were really focused on getting their groceries's groceries.
It is a lot of standing and walking the grocery store.
I also hate that you have to wear uniform while the traditional banks do not have to.
this bank has the best training facilities however.
Not much for promotion.
Great Work Enviorment.
"It really depends what you are looking for, but I had a great experience at this company."
There are opportunities from advancement as well as a healthy work environment.
Great family.
The team you join becomes a family.
The people are great.
My particular team lead was understanding and easy going.
The people are pretty fair with pay and your experience.
You get raises on time.
Work is steady but at peak season you will be very busy.
Pretty good place to work
Extremely stressful job.
Many policies and procedures that have to be followed or you could be fired even from one mistake/accident.
You're expected to talk to customers and engage customers while also paying attention to Many policies and procedures that have to be followed and counting customers's money.
You are also expected to meet sales goals such as up-selling credit cards and accounts offered by this bank.
Okay.  
this bank is an okay place to work.
this bank provide for work life balance with very generous time off.
this bank's salaries and comp plan is poor.
this bank does not think about this bank's decisions before this bank make their decisions.
Awesome company to work for.. I had a great experience working for this company.
I was able to advance from a Date Entry operator to a Team Leader position.
"Were I was able to perform several functions including: new employees training, audit, traveling to new acquired banks to train new acquired banks's employees the functions at our department, prepare department functions instructions packets, prepare the monthly calendar and assign daily functions task for the month, attend all management meetings, prepare the initial start or end of day of the system when assigned, attend quaterly system testing and more."
"Good benefits and job security, poor management, poor compensation."
Pros -Benefits package is good.
1. Vacation has been bumped up to 3 weeks when you start + eligable 1 week vacation purchase after 2 years in position 2.
You get 2 additional paid holidays off each year.
"3. Maternity/paternity leave has been bumped to 16 weeks paid for women, and 6 weeks paid for men 4."
Pension and 401k available. -Job security.
Cons -You will find poor management in many departments.
"Very hard to come by good leadership and transparent managers -Compensation is 10%-20% less for certain positions in IT, they usu ally low ball -Moving up in the company seems very limited for how large the company is."
"Applying to positions internally is just as hard to get as if you're applying externally -Compenstion raises are very rare, you'll either get a standard 2% or a lot of times 0% depending on the position -No bonuses of any kind -You will feel more like a number in a large company like the company."
blah.
"The location of the branch i worked at had an average amount of foot traffic, however only regulars came in on a day to day basis which left little chance to make referrals of establish new accounts."
My manager was very rude and did not know how to preform any of the task of My manager's employees.
Good Company opportunity for advancement.
I worked as a bank teller for one of this bank'S Banking Centers.
It was fast paced work.
"I helped assist customers with there banking needs withdrawing cash, deposit cash, process payments, cash checks, etc."
Great for Sales Personal.
Everything is moving to a more automated self service culture and appointment banking.
With introduction of new technology eventually generations will not use Brick and Mortar branch's the way previous generations have.
always there is a lot of sales at the Branches.
Management at the Branches were always supported by the corp. office commission and bonuses were always fair and on time with our paid check .
"Payd vacations , Holidays , discount employee discounts sales Sales and comminsion were always apropied for the employee"
Great company if you're in the right job.
Working as a financial specialist.
"Normal work day is M-F, 8:30am-5:15pm."
Work two Saturday's a month and a late night calling session.
Management was pretty good and always available for a phone call if needed.
"As far as this bank as a company, I like this bank as a company's benefits and work / life balance."
"As for job security, this bank as a company are doing away with the financial specialist roll so I have to find another position within this bank as a company or look elsewhere."
Assistant Branch Manager.
Coach Employees and be energetic so customers and employees have the best experience.
Coach to attain daily/weekly goals.
Excellent multi tasking position.
"My work day usually began with customer complaints, I did develop and learn excellent customer service skills through this experience."
"The remainder of My work day would include processing loan applications, opening consumer accounts, and sales calls."
The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I met.
The most challenging part of my job were the sales goals required of me.
Great workplace.
I've been with this bank for 9 years and if not for a recent job displacement I planned on retiring from here.
I had an opportunity to work with many wonderful people whom I would consider friends.
It has been a great experience for me.
"My career at this bank could possibly continue, however with a recent job displacement, I figured I would take this opportunity to explore my options."
Life is short!
Not pressured to sell nor stay 9-5.. Not much micro management but too many changes too often.
A lot of turn over.
"Also, a lot of gossip which I've seen get employees fired on multiple occasions."
good place.
Productive.
Company had good relationship with clients.
Reviews were fair and helpful.
Worked in teams for both internal and external clients.
No employee loyalty.
Loved my job in every possible way.
Coworker made and accusation and I was guilty until proven innocent even though I had been a highly decorated employee for years.
Treatment was crushing.
Average.  
"this bank is a good company for entry level positions, and this bank does encourage this bank's workers to advance."
The key is finding good management that will help you to grow.
Decent Starter Company.
Compensation is lower than most financial institutions and work personal life balance can be hard to achieve due to short staffing issues.
"Teaches and trains and prepares you for any other position you may be willing to apply for, however, Teaches like to promote from other markets or external candidates."
"Benefits are good as Benefits still match 4%, but we no longer have an option for PPO or HMO insurances, only High Deduction."
Professional Environment and Cooperative Management Teams.  
"this bank is a great company to work for, this bank have a great management team and your best career interests in mind."
Job stability is not particularly high in a constantly changing investment management position.
Nice pay.
This job is pretty straight forward.
You are taking calls most of the day & This job requires for you to be on the phones and at your desk at all times.
Productive & Center around family.
The hardest part of the job was the schedules.

face paced.
it was a face paced environment that is big on hitting sales goals.
I had a great relationship with the branch manager.
The problem lied with the supervisor who didn't feel like the supervisor who didn't feel like she needed to train her new hires and did little to no work day to day needed to train the supervisor who didn't feel like she needed to train her new hires and did little to no work day to day's new hires and did little to no work day to day.
Morale and work place.
Trying to advance at this bank is very hard.
With all the qualification the comment states we found someone else that has more experience.
The work place is micro managed .
Employees do not particpate in any activites due to work needs to be down at service level.
Morale is very low.
Try several times to apply in different areas but never was considered.
They state age is not the factor which age is.
0k this is my summary.  
"this bank is a lovely organization to work for, this bank certainly seriously champion work life balance and the management team is very astute and interested and involved with the development of the employee to an extent"
that overwhelms and astonishes
Good company.

Management was a bit lacking at the time.
"Overall, decent company and has great benefits."
Great workplace environment with emphasis on employees.

I've learned a lot from this bank since employment but would like to find more challenging opportunities.

it was good company to work for.
I liked to work there with great co-worker and managers.
unfortunately I had to move otherwise I would be still working there.
Great work enviroment and coworkers.
"I loved working for this bank, the only reasons I chose to leave was location and lack of advancement in my position."
If I could work at this bank with a supervisor or managerial position I would leap at the chance.
Work/Life Balance.  
this bank strives to meet the work/life balance of this bank's employees.
"this bank achieve this by offering a flexible work schedule, work from home opportunity, and a generous time away package (vacation, personal, occasional absence days)"
N/a. Unrealistic sales goals and expectations.
Not enough development conversations with upper management.
Training procedures are not consistent.
"Great culture, not great pay."
I have enjoyed working for this bank for four years.
I like the people I work with and the company culture is great.
The pay (at least at the branch level) is not
"Great managers, great products, but, incentive is not motivating."
I work outside of a branch setting which affords more opportunity and freedom.
"My manager is awesome, luckily."
"As a outside sales banker, I understand incentive and how to make money clearly but, the problem is this company keep cutting the incentive pay and not in small amounts Important to understand how much 'this company' want your role to ever make."
Not motivated to keep up the superior sales because of the continuous cut.
"Why bother putting in the extra if this company want average Many great programs, people, vision in this company."
"But, if you make too much sales incentive in your role, this company will cut your role."
this company is a big company and this seems to be common.
3 Star.  
this bank is a decent company to work for.
I spent 7.5 years working for this bank.
Advanced from a personal banker to branch manager.
There is Opportunity for career growth and advancement.
Fired After Asking For A Transfer.
There is minimal training and a 'to the wolves' on the job methods.
I asked for a transfer to a different state and was fired the next day.
Terrible company to work for.
Large national bank with plenty of opportunity.  
this bank is a large national commercial bank.
I enjoyed the fact that I was part of a great group in workout and we enjoyed camaraderie.
The bureaucracy could at times be overwhelming.
"However, there are substantial opportunities for advancement."
Outstanding Management Committed to Customer Loyalty.
I was employed with bank N Bank when bank N Bank was acquired by bank N Bank.
I have a long history of bank take-overs and I must say that bank N Bank was outstanding in the way all of the employees and customers were treated.
Optimum training was offered and time was properly given for each employee to know how to make the transition very smooth for the retention of bank N Bank's customers.
My co-workers were the best!
We shared a strong desire to make the retail branch system easily understood by our customers.
We excelled at customer service in an environment where the customers felt welcome.
Great Work Experience.
Working with RBC was a great work experience.
The benefits are excellent and the people who work there are top notch.
It's easy to get spoiled at RBC.
Teller/Customer Service Associate I. •Assisted in the opening and closing of the bank.
"•Performed important transactions for personal accounts, small and large businesses."
•Responded effectively to customers' inquiries and concerns regarding various account benefits
Good Company.
Management is great.
Good peopl Bank holdiays.
Multiple location Large Pittsburgh brand.
Certain departments are better than others.
Lower to average pay
Ample opportunity for advancement within your business line..
A good place to work.
"A licensed financial specialist (FS) has a moderate base pay, but with the capacity to earn more than A licensed financial specialist (FS)'s base pay (via quarterly incentive bonuses)."
"Unfortunately, the FS position is being eliminated across this bank's entire footprint, effective April 2017."
"Having the right team, makes the job smoother."
This job duties were very simple and manageable.
There was plenty of time to keep up with the compliance training and your daily work load.
The management at my particular branch was not qualified for the job.
"The hardest part of the job, was knowing what you were going to eat for lunch and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all types of people."
Meeting new people and helping new people better understand new people's bank accounts and new people's finances.
work-life.  
this bank is an amazing company!
this bank truly care about this bank's workers!
I love this bank!
it was the best job I ever had!
this bank really took care of me!
"Very productive, multitasking."
It's very functional and high pace.
"Good hours, great benefits."
Employees are very easy to get along with & great management.
The training is great and help you prepare for the job the job itself.
Hawthorn.
"Part of the larger organization, Hawthorn serves the ultra high net worth client."
The team members are high calibre professionals but the larger organization has many organizational issues.
So unprofessional and unethical.
There is no structure in this Bank.
"this Bank give you a low base pay, but promise you will make 4-10,000 a quarter in incentives."
You don't.
"And nobody can tell you how the revenue credit incentives really work, even when people exceed goal with the revenue credit incentives people don't know how people did it to replicate goal each month."
I well exceeded my individual and branch production goals but it didn't correlate into revenue credit incentives.
Most bankers get 700 dollars a quarter after taxes.
"The turnover is insane, the manager that hired me quit before I got done with training, we went through 3 in a year, I had 20 people in my training class, only 3 of us made it there longer than 6 months."
"If you have health issues and get approved for Fmla, they try to find little things to let you go for."
"I have worked in 3 banks, I've never been at a company for less than 3 years, it was a struggle staying here a year and a half."
Big on sales.
Hated all the sales goals/requirements.
Many of all the sales goals/requirements (QIAs) are very difficult to get.
I felt much more like a sales person/telemarketer than a banker.
Productive.
"It is a very friendly enviroment, you have many opportunites to grow."
"It all depends on the location you are in, the people you meet and the things you learn is a great experience that can help you excel in life."
Excellent place to work.
My job is to help the company save money on possible bad loans.
I do background research and provided that information so that the Relationship Managers can make a sound decision on where or not it is safe to extend a loan.
I work with an excellent group.
We are always there for each other.
Helping each other when needed.
There is nothing hard about the job.
"I enjoy my job, my manager and my co workers."
We all get along.
Work eithic.
Work eithic was a nice place to work but Work eithic was also just a lot of rules that people that didn't follow the rules.
Did what people that didn't follow the rules wanted to do and not get into trouble.
The ones who did do the work got told.
the hardest part of my job was having to deal with issues that people didn't want to do people's job.
The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all the people and getting to know each other.
Fun place to work.
Fun place to work.
"was great place to work, because Fun place to work."
was close to my home.
I learned everyone is not going to acknowledge when you do good.
Management was not the great.
"The hardest part of job was not being recognized for a job well done, and most enjoyable part was being able to go home for lunch to spend time with my son."
Work day.
I work from 8am to 4:30pm EST.
I spend most of my day reviewing applications and calling customers advising of our loan process.
A great experience of a business environment.
"Dealing with client transactions on a daily basis, this bank allowed me to better understand the financial world around us."
"With a managements desire to promote our clients to new services and banking options, this bank has taught me to search for a customers needs and provide a customers various options."
"While dealing with client services in a professional atmosphere, this positions pushed to reverted my language in a professional matter when dealing with clients."
"Along with the incentive to push various products on our clients, to better serve our clients's banking needs."
wonderful company.
"They offer good products, plenty of training, enjoyed my co-workers, great company."
"the health insurance was a little expensive,"
Awful.
Worked here for a short period of time.
"Management was awful, nobody was willing to help or answer a question."
Will never bank with or work for this bank again.
great place.
I really learned a lot during my time at this bank.
the people were great and still keep in touch with the people.
this bank was really good place to work
Do Not Recommend.
Massive turn over will fire employees because employees do not meet the cares model.
We had over twenty people to start there are two people left.
The job is a good job.
The customers can be rude at times but bit is a great work place.
"I really desired a teller job because I love handling money, and I am good with customers."
"The job can become tedious at times, but it is worth it when a customers comes and flips your day upside down."
"Fun Environment, minus the customers."
"Always a good day, unless there's a line waiting 30 minutes before you open."
good thing the coffee is always stocked.
"Manager is great, co workers awesome."
Not a good company to work for.
Work and never recognized or acknowledged for your job done.
Stressed daily on whether or not you would have a job or if you were getting laid off.
They didn't care about the people in the eastern part.
This was not a good company to work for.
Good starting job with room for advancement.
"A teller position is a good place to start if you want to work through school, or plan to move up in the banking industry."
There is plenty of room for advancement and raises.
It is what you make it.
Working at this bank does not have limits.
"You can work hard, network, and gain experience in whatever segment you like."
It is your choice to be content or proactive.
Employees first.
"Dedicated employees, family-friendly place to work Supportive management."
Increasing use of technology to help enable employee's productivity.
innovative.
possible the best run bank on the east coast.
others institutions have tried but this bank seems to execute with the best of them.
very caring and supportive.
"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash."
"On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the peers, lead staff, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients''s needs and organizing the team schedules around the clients''s priorities."
"I am about to learn new task, how to work effectively."
my co-workers are amazing wish is one of the best part of the job.
Poor Management.
Not much chance for advancement.
The benefits are ok but the pay leaves much to be desired.
Management could definitely use some people skills.
Not the worst place to work but not the best either.
"Low pay, horrible management, no team work."
Would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a career in banking.
There's few advancement possibilities and the pay is terrible.
Managers are all about Managers and there is no teamwork.
this company's nothing but a competition when it comes to meeting sales goals.
this company depend on Gallup surveys to see how well employees perform and when you get a bad score this company make you feel like scum.
Very bad atmosphere and none of employees are happy.
Promotes Values that this bank do not follow.  
"this bank promotes values of work life balance, teamwork, and positivity but values of work life balance, teamwork, and positivity do not deliver."
"values of work life balance, teamwork, and positivity will make it difficult to take paid time off that has been earned no matter the reason, management does not work with employees to work towards advancement in this bank."
Often reject request to go to different departments when employees are eligible.
"great management, a very good place to grow in the banking world."
promotions happen very often.
"Management is great, lots of space for promotion."
"Great benefits, 3 weeks vacation, paid sick time."
You are able to interact with a great range of individuals from all walks of life
Not the best but ok.
If you learn slow they'll get rid of you.
The trainers over at woodland park will stab your back and tell your managers bad things about you.
Do not trust The trainers over at woodland park even if The trainers over at woodland park act as your friend.
Awesome company.
I've been with them for about two years and I love it.
You learn so much about finances and the people you work with make work better.
The clients are great and you leave feeling satisfied with what you do.
Great place to work!.
Love the culture and leadership.
"Very little work life balance however, company is very understanding of employee need."
Sales are easy to achieve.
For hard workers and flexible employees.
Moved up and around within company very easily.
supportive supervisors that are willing to help you advance.
Most departments offer a competitive commission based pay option.
Enviornment.
Great place to work.
The employee opinion matters as well as the clients.
Strong reputation in the community.
Excellent training programs and career profiles.
Production is ultimate goal.
Each day involves different tax tasks to complete daily.
Efficient filing of applicable tax returns is annual goal.
Need more managers to allow employees to conform to policies and procedures.
Co-workers very sociable and well mannered and best part of job.
Hedge fund accounting at it's worst.
"Long work days, constant turnover."
There was not a ton of positive things to say except that this was a good way to start one's career but not much more to offer beyond that.
Stressful environment.
The mortgage industry is by far the most stressful environment to work in.
"The nature of The mortgage industry is personal, since The mortgage industry involves people's homes."
Thin line between empathy and being firm.
"Great opportunities as an individual producer, but not for management.."
"Great company if you are just starting out, lots of opportunity to move up at first."
The culture is inclusive and focused on teamwork.
Great company do well with recognizing employees who go above and beyond.
"Unfortunately, Great company's salaries ranges are not very competitive as you move up in sales positions and management."
Retail management compensation does not equate to the work load and responsibilities.
Individual salespeople can earn more through incentive that what most branch managers make.
this bank has flexible work arrangements and benefits are OK.
It is hard to move up in the company as promotion from within has become rare..  
this bank has flexible work arrangements and benefits are OK.
It is hard to move up in the company as promotion from within has become rare.
A Great Job.
Love what I do so it was easy to enjoy my days at work.
it a high demand and challenging company.
i would recommend it to those who are starting in the finance career but not to experienced veterans.
Goals were out of control.
upper management encouraged calling clients multiple times a week even when clients did not want to be contacted.
Employees were constantly harassed if Employees's clients were not sold on multiple items.
Nice People.
There are often nice people that you encounter in the work environment.
"Work life balance is great with the company, the company will make sure that if you put in the time request off that you can get that time off to be with your family and friends."
Fast paced and fun work enviornment.
I answered inbound calls for loan officers and assisted with completion of loan applications.
You have to be a team player to enjoy this position as you have to rely on your team members to sometimes complete troubleshooting
Great management.
Great team work.
Great benefits..
It was a great place to work 5 years ago.
Had time for family and the pay was great.
With new management new management extended the working house plus you always have to stay longer if there are shortages or overages on the teller line (which happens almost every day).
You can't plan your life with this job.
Even when you off or on vacation you will always receive stressing calls from managers or co-workers.
Mandatory no overtime which is sucks.
Schedule planning is horrible.
You work 40 hours/week for 6 days (sometimes 7 days).
The biggest and annoying part of this job was the call nights or multi-channel calls.
Its a mandatory blocked out time to call new clients.
It's all about calls.
Opportunity is there for Millenials.
"Company focus has recently changed with some positives, many negatives."
"With time, Millenials will resolve Millenials's internal struggle in implementing the changes Millenials needs to make for the future Great people with many years experience, however Millenials is focusing on hiring less experienced people to pay less money."
Excellent.
I love this bank!
Great company and excellent hours with a nice pay and bonus!
I do like the benefits as well has the retirement plan!
I work at a branch with great co-workers!
No negatives!
Great place to work!.
No negatives!
Great place to work!
"Tuition reimbursement is an easy process, lots of paid time off and opportunity to advance."
Very relaxed atmosphere.
"Great Perks, low costing benefits."
"Wonderful company to work for, however there is a trade for the perks and a trade for the perks's the pay."
"Perks are good especially holidays and health, pay is low."
It's banking so you get days off another career wouldn't normally offer.
"Lots and lots of time off, 3 weeks vacation, 1 personal day, 5 sick days; if you are on written warning or the sort for absences, the fault is all yours."
The supervisors are great The supervisors'll move you up if you're good!
"I've worked at worse places when it comes to perks, but the pay was way higher."
"Company matches 5% 401k, healthcare costs are low and I have a family."
All depends on what you're looking for.
Pay vs perks definitely though.
"I settled for peace of mind, at least until I can have both."
Day in the life.
"Your a number, you punch in you clock out and then your home."
Not a lot of opportunity for growth or advancement if management has it out for you.
Which is easy for management to do
Excellent.
Stable company that is concerned about The company's employee's.
The company offers competitive wages and benefits.
There is room for advancement and relocation as well.
horrible.
My manager was an imbecile who should not have even been able to get such a job.
My manager also showed very inappropriate pictures of My manager in a bikini to everyone.
Then my assistant manager was just as bad.
my assistant manager talked to me and one of the other tellers about deer mating rituals.
"me and one of the other tellers were both very unethical, inappropriate, and incompetent."
When I got back from vacation I had found that they had but $80 of counterfeit 20s in the ATM and didn't even notice.
Branch employee in Giant supermarkets.
Take this Job with an eye towards this Job being extremely temporary..
An absolutely terrible experience with no work life balance and management that must not have been able to get a job anywhere else.
The ethics policy should be printed on toilet paper and hiring is a joke.
love the job.
"really great company to work for, really easy place with stress free environments I would highty recommend the company to anyone"
Temp Assignment.
The company had great diversity and decent pay but The company treat The company's employees terrible.
Management talked to their employees as if their employees were beneath their employees
Conflicted relationship building strategy vs production goals.
Conflicted relationship building strategy vs production goals.
Production goals are always at the forefront of everything although your told that deepening client relationships is the goal.
Client Friendly.
Diverse workforce close to public transportation.
It's in the heart of the city where their a fine eateries and great places to shop.
Great.
Very relaxed environment while being productive.
Business owners are very caring and understanding.
Great place to work
Productive and successful..
A typical day is always a learning environment.
"I have learned that the work flow leads, supervisors, manager and assistant manager, and co-workers (Extractors, Keyers, Scanners, etc.) are very helpful."
The hardest part of the job is figuring out what is requested regarding payments and/or refunds; only some accounts.
The most enjoyable part of my day and getting in the office and putting my best forward and being successful regarding my day to day routine.
"Management is Pretty good, Screening for employees is bad."
"Self Explanatory, some good co workers and decently well listening management, but high turnover of employees."
Corporate/HR not very helpful.
Pay is not good compensation....
non-livable wage for tellers and teller supervisors.
"Great Culture, diverse company to work for."
No competitive wages and opportunity for advancement.
The most important part of this job is to be sure th.
"Great Culture, diverse company to work for."
No competitive wages and opportunity for advancement.
The most important part of this job is to be sure there is open lines of communication.
OHIO Equity Group.
I started my career in banking here.
It was a good place to work with good people.
good people are also no longer in business due to the mortgage crash of 2008.
Potential to improve.
There's consistent issues with staffing and a disconnect between corporate and retail but hopefully they're working on consistent issues with staffing and a disconnect between corporate and retail.
Great benefits.
Quiet atmosphere.
Great bank for growth and investment but poorly chosen managers.
Highly stressful atmosphere but severely underpaid employees which results in a constant turnover.
A great way to get your foot in the door and learn the business..
"Typical banking operations, with a well diversified management group."
"Unfortunately, cold calling is now prevalent in daily practices."
Summary.
"Loved my co-workers, decent management, low compensation, very competitive work environment."
"Growth opportunity, flexible schedules, free lunch and okay benefits."
horrible.
Painted a colorful picture then never followed thru with training for promotion.
"management was horrible, Lots of politics, very unorganized made job difficult."
"Good work to life balance, horrible sales policy."
"Pushes sales, you do not bonus with out meeting sales goals, do not receive raise if you do not meet sales calls, bankers have to cold call."
Excellent work place.
At this financial institute you will learn and grow.
This company is a well professional environment.
Management is excellent.
The coworkers there pleasant and nice.
The hardest part of this job is closing a customer with loans or convincing a customer to invest for there future.
I enjoy This company because This company's a caring and diverse company.
Productive and nice work place.
I start my shift at 6:00 a.m.
I have to verify check payments in a timely matter.
Ensure the appropriate materials are with correct payments.
The mot enjoyable part of my job is providing great accuracy and quality for our customers.
this bank provides the tools and accomidation to do your job.
"There are numerous job opportunities in lower levels, but advancing is difficult unless you get in to a mentoring program."
this bank is a major financial bank in the United Status.
Great place to start.
Loved this job and the people I worked with.
Not much opportunity for career advancement at he branch level.
Overall a great place to start my banking career.
Not a fun place to work..
Not a nice place to work.
There is not much room for advancement unless you know someone.
The credit card department is the worst department to go into.
Not what they tell you in interview.
working in a branch is a difficult task and they leave things out at the interview.
work life balance is not good.
hard to even make doc appointments.
everything is if a branch can afford you not working that day.
its 6days a week unless you use vacation.
bonus is hard to get when this bank approval rate on loans are high.
teller.
"Processing various customers transactions including deposits, withdrawals , transfers , payments , and check cashing ."
Balancing cash drawer .
Recommending appropriate products.
Super nice Management very helpful.
Also co
#NAME?
Great Place to Work.
"Great corporate culture and stable, though hard to advance once inside due to a very poor pay band structure that favors outside talent over inside talent."
Productive and fun workplace.  
this bank is an excellent employer.
this bank offer a host of products to suit the growing needs of both the individual consumer and the large corporate customers.
Good place to gain experience in order to advance.
"A typical day on the job consists of checking and answering emails, resolving any issues that your clients may have (such as an account that has been overdrawn), answering phone calls, making outbound calls to schedule appointments, handle financial transactions and open bank accounts."
"Lastly lots of coffee In regards to learning, I learned a lot about financial products and how financial products work such as mortgages."
I learned how to provide really good customer service Management was very respectful but many times somewhat hypocritical in Management's demands for meeting goals Hardest part was dealing with very rude customers and making sales goals with products such as credit cards because many people would not qualify The most enjoyable part was helping really great clients.
There were many of really great clients that were very appreciative and nice.
Also the coffee was pretty good.
this bank.
Overall a good company to work for.
I made tons of friends at this bank.
During my time there pay was much better than what I heard it is today though.
Best Communication among co workers.
High goals were given which you can can only achieve if you have every team member on board.
Daily team huddles to know the areas of focus we needed to work on.
Learning the strengths and weakness of each and every team member and working off of the strengths and weakness of each and every team member.
You spent so much time with your fellow team mates you would create a family bond.
Not the same.
I have been at this bank for 4 years.
Customers and employees used to matter.
Not anymore.
All management cares about is the stockholder and stock price.
Business Analyst - Mortgage.
Overall good experience.
You will spend lots of time preparing decks and researching KPI's for senior management to make intelligent business decisions.
"There can be obstacles to getting things done (departments, old thought processes, ect.)"
that make this job frustrating at time.
"However, leadership is receptive to feedback."
Stressful environment for low pay but provides good experience and benefits if you stay long enough..
I've been with the bank for four years in two separate positions.
In two separate positions I've been one of the top performers in my region but nothing is ever good enough and getting anything above an mediocre review and subsequently a decent raise is extremely difficult.
the bank will always find one category you didn't hit goal at and use one category you didn't hit goal at to justify the bank's position.
Bonuses can be great or horrible depending on your position and time of year.
The incentive plan changes all the time.
the bank have gone as far as to change incentive negatively for products you've already sold but of course only positively for future sales.
Turnover is extremely high and staffing is a constant issue.
"It's not uncommon to run at half staff for months at a time, meanwhile the goals and expectations stay the same."
It's not uncommon that you have to do two people's jobs.
Then of course you work constant overtime and take short or no lunch.
"I've had co-workers quit and walk out, go to lunch and never come back, no call no show for days then quit, have panic attacks at work and have to leave, all because of the stress level and demands of the job."
The benefits package is nice but you have to be with the company for 6 months before you get your full benefits and 3 years before your vested in the company's 401(k) and pension.
"So if you leave for any reason before 3 years, you lose your full benefits and 3 years before your vested in their 401(k) and pension."
Watch your back.
They are letting great employees go when great employees challenge lack of strategy to win.
"They say they are a tech leader, but they are not."
The word collaboration does not exist in retail banking.
Great place to work with the right manager.
Great customers but a typical day at work can be horrible depending on the type of day your manager is having.
Management should be the examples Management wish to see in Management's employees.
"Too many Indians, not enough Chiefs."
I've learned the art of multitasking.
Great customers though...
Fast paced and well organized workplace..
"A typical day at work is busy, but with ample oppurtunity to be personally attentive to customers."
"I've learned a multitude of neccesary, people and teamwork skills that make my workplace experience extremely fufilling ."
Great Team overall.
Great team and management.
I receive a lot of support and work to life balance.
No sales pressure and great clients to work with.
Upper management takes the time to know you.
Great job if you are looking for a career to move up.  
this bank is a great company.
Especially if you have no set skills.
this bank's on the job training is top notch.
Depending if you are a teller or a customer service rep at the desk your day can be different.
But your day is consumed with helping customers which I love.
The processes that are set up for this bank makes it easy to complete your daily task.
Friendly Inviorment.
"Distributing and collecting mail, stock floor orders; handle inquiries from this bank employees; provide office support; answer incoming calls and perform data entry."
It is a lot of walking and you must have good memory.
Never Work There.
The banks want to tell you how to do everything and when to do it.
This is why when you go to The banks there are so many new faces.
Very strict.
great place to work yada yada yada i filed this request before and do not feel like repeating myself indeed all i need is a job not to review old jobs im looking for better opportunities
"Cool company, nothing amazing.."
I learned a lot.
There's opportunities to grow and get promoted.
The hours were excellent in-store honestly.
I loved my shifts.

this bank's very productive and effective company.  
this bank is a company that I recommend for every one good work ethics productive tolerance love it.all this time the main supervisor are great and manjement.
If you want to excell apply for this bank.
I love my job here.
Its amazing.
this bank give you opportunities to do any job you want.
You don't have to go to school to be a banker this bank compeletely train you on everything you need to know
"Poor Management, Glass Ceilings and Underpayment.  "
this bank is notorious for underpaying this bank's employees.
The average education level of my department is a GED.
I have a Masters and do not get paid equally.
The management team creates a glass ceiling and an exclusionary environment.
Out of 6 individuals with Masters
", there will only be one individual left after I leave."
Great Company.
The company is very sales driven.
Management can be tough.
"Good benefits, good bonuses, base pay is low but bonuses will make for that"
this bank.
I don't agree with the way that the treat African American employees.
African American employees have decent healthcare plans.
The work environment was very unprofessional and chaotic.
"The pay was good, however the hectic atmosphere isn't worth it."
Great place to work.
"Great place to work, however, management could use some more training in communication."
The incentive program which his based on your performance is great.
Great work/life balance.
Besides dealing with the customer's's calling frantically about the customer's's money I enjoy this bank.
The team leads value your opinion.
Great place to work.  
this bank was a great place to work.
I had to move out of state with a significant other and there were no this bank's where I was moving.
It was a shame I had to leave.
Good.
I started here when I was young and this job was a great job that grew up with me.
The customers are the best and it is great learning
The customers's stories and getting to know The customers.
I have learned so much from this job a lot of young people my age probably know nothing about.
Greatest opportunity I have had so far.

My position is prospect deadline oriented.
Support the sales team.
Good place for working mothers - back-up care options
"Flexibility in most teams, terrible compensation."
"While this bank can be flexible in most situations with work-life balance and setting work schedules, this bank do not seem to care about retaining good employees."
I have seen many great employees leave over the last couple of years because of compensation.
"Employees for the most part, are not compensated competively and even when people receive promotions, people are sometimes still not receiving even a one dollar increase in salary."
"Productive,."
A typical day at an in-store this bank would be from 10am-730pm.
Most of out time is spent cold calling a lot of the customers this bank encounter in the teller station and positioning products and services
banker.
"i work at this bank, its okay with just about everything, but the work in non rewarding, and the managers are crazy in the current low rate environment."
the managers've lost the managers's work/life balance appeal
Challenge accepted.... and conqured.
"As a Lead/Project Manager I have to monitor workflow, do all reporting, head meetings, and put out the day to day fires."
"It takes great organizational and time management skills I've learned a lot about managing time, meeting deadlines, how to manage in a fast paced, business environment I've helped build my team into a well oiled, independent machine that needs little supervision."
my team are a great group who takes on challenges well The hardest part about the job is managing several different time sensitive aspects of the job at once.
"Emails, instant messages, persona team inquiries, meetings, and upper management requests and the juggling it takes to e successful"
The most enjoyable part of my job is the challenge the job brings day to day and the unique problem solving aspect of the job.

I learned a great deal at this bank.
"My immediate Supervisors were dedicated to this bank's success, I was looking forward to going full time when the decision was made to move West."

Good.
Very tight team.
Boss gives you daily action plans.
Every week sale goals meeting.
Small work place.
Workers clean ban Health Care very cheap
You get to know a lot of people.  
this bank was a good bank to work for until they bought all these banks and know they are getting to big for themselves.
My co workers are nice and everybody gets along.
Busy Banking Office.
Working 14 years in Banking it is changing.
My roles are: ~greeting and processing up to 4 lanes of vehicles.

~customer service.
~handling cash & vault.
~handling any complaints and taking ownership and getting any complaints resolved.
~making sure all data in computer is accurate.

"Working in the Drive Thru is challenging every day, you are by yourself & you need to use your best judgement on handling certain situations or call management for further assistance."
"Busy/Stressful, but good culture.."
Great company and culture.
Benefits are pretty good if you take advantage of what is offered.
Work load is high and pace of everything is fast.
A lot of turnover/transition can further heighten stress.
Good bank to work for.
"much better than the other bigger banks, in SoFla where they are building market share the company culture is great, a lot less pressure than other major players."
"Poor Management, Unreal Expectations, Poor Pay, Lack of concern for employees."
"It was a good job to work at to get a start at first, but I am extremely looking forward to moving on to a different career."
Great Place to Work.
I greatly enjoyed working at this bank for all of these years.
I would still be there if it was not that I had to move back to Alabama.
"While there I was able to gain many relevant skills that afforded me to be very successful as a Branch Manager, Team Leader, Partner, Trainer and most importantly a Positive, Supportive, Encouraging TEAM MEMBER!"
"Fun place,work life balance,."
I love my job and assisting the customer with financial freedom.
I enjoy coming into work with an amazing supervisor and co-workers.
this bank offers a strong sense of work-life balance and accommodating work environment
Negative environment and poor management.
"I worked for this company a short time,but it didn't take long to realize I made a mistake."
The training is long and pointless.
The pay is the lowest no matter what position you have and the benefits aren't good either.
The branch I worked in was so unorganized and stressful.
"Most were catty,unprofessional and not trained well to manage anything."
I'm not surprised they have so much turn over within this company.
If only this company could pick the people this company work with.
don't waste your time!!
Awesome Career.
Make it the best you can I loved my time here at this bank I just wish they would paymore money they pay a little under the market
Great place to work.
I have really enjoyed my time at this bank.
I have been able to learn a lot and move up within this bank.
"However, when I graduated from law school this bank were unable to find a position for me in this bank."
Good Experience.
I love working for the company however the compensation is not quite where I wish the compensation were.
Great advancement opportunities to broaden your experience but no real shift in salary.
"I have a great manager, but I do believe this aspect could really make or break your experience."
Unstable and Unfocused.
The potential at the branch level is immense.
However the structure of the organization provided more obstacles than opportunities.
productive and fun working place.
working with coordination and helping each other to accomplish the task going on in the company plan.
plus creating conducive environment in the work plac thanks
"Productive workplace, talented co-workers."
"I enjoyed working at this bank, everyone on the team was focused on delivering the highest quality service/product in a respectful working atmosphere."
need to be self- starter.
The management seems to be very negative.
Training platform was very poorly setup.
Without support from our managers it was hard to succeed.
Great benefits-harsh management.
Great benefits but management expected too much from employees with very little pay.
401k and pension are provided as well as great benefits for working mothers
Many issues within this bank.  
"this bank...antiquated systems that leave this bank's employees high and dry, upper management constantly changing, one conference call after another, just chasing numbers to make numbers look good, new incentive structure lessen payouts with more production."
Not the client centric bank this bank originated from due to chasing stock price of 100$ per share.
"Every change that came down the river was a negative one towards ground level employees in the branches/call centers, which was very often because I feel this bank is trying to find this bank's identity in the retail banking world."
"Regional national trying to be a Wells Fargo with Bill Gates Dos operating systems, Don't waste your time if your smart, people person, and have a mind of your own, because you will be formed into a corporate robot within the first 90 days."
Employee appreciation week is very nice.
I have had the opportunity to learn about the post default and property preservation; the hardest part of the job is the increase work and less help
Productive work environment.
A productive work environment.
A friendly team.
A wonderful service.
Easily maintianable balance between work and general life balance.
Experienced customer service associate.

"An unwavering commitment to customer service, with the ability to build productive relationships, resolve complex issues and win customer loyalty."
"Strategic-relationship/partnership-building skills -- listen attentively, solve problems creatively, and use tact and diplomacy to find common ground and achieve win-win outcomes."
Love this bank.
I absolutely loved working for this bank.
this bank really values this bank employment and the personal and professional growth of this bank's employees.
"Due to the high value of their employees, the high value of the employees shows through to the customers so that the customers feel valued as well."
I only left because this bank couldn't accommodate my school schedule at the time.
I would love to go back to this bank in a corporate perspective because I was just a teller.
Good work/life balance.
Emphasis on relationship with clients and clients's financial well-being..
"Client-centered company, truly concerned about clients' well-being."
"Benefits are good, work/life balance excellent."
"Good working conditions, great fiscal policies."
"Great work-life balance, less than median pay."
People and culture are great.
Very collaborative and helpful.
Typically a bit lower paid than other institutions.
The bank has a very flexible work-life balance that allows the vast majority of employees work from home if the vast majority of employees wish.
I would recommend working here.
Part Time Teller Indianapolis.
I am a part time teller.
I work 26 hours per week.
I love my job and management team.
management team will back you up and we are like family.
My co-workers are great.
We always have each other and we work as a team.
I have really learned banking skills to make me successful.
The most enjoyable part of my job is my this bank.
family at work.
I love my job and I love the customers who make my job so enjoyable.
"Strong Work Culture, but..... Enjoyed the relationship with my peers, however the relationship with my peers felt very segregated between teams."
Managers often felt too superior and spent much time on personal work.
"I can vouch for it, because I sat next to my team lead and my team lead was taking personal calls all day for my team lead's other job."
good pay.
the pay is fine the people are nice and it is a good place to work I love this bank with all of my heart positive review from this chick here woop woop
Great place to work.
"its a great place to work, benefits are good and diversity at workplace is excellent, co-worker definitely the best part of my day."
"the most enjoyable part of my day is that I can be myself , management is a part that I have a lot of respect for the support given through the years."
Great company but job security is becoming an issue.
Opportunity for growth is very evident.
Diversity throughout the company is encouraging.
Job security not as strong as Job security has been in the past with recent layoffs
Great company.
Great company with several opportunities for advancement.
"great for someone who is new to banking to gain experience in different lines of business, as they are all frequently looking for candidates."
Great company up North..
"Due to low market share in the south, the company is still trying to figure out the south which makes for very pressured environment."
Waste of time.
You will be humiliated working at this bank.
There's not enough training in the world for all the inconsistent training and changes they make daily.
Wish I never fell for the positive and enthusiastic smiles and comments.
the positive and enthusiastic smiles and comments played me well.
Management needs work.
management is always changing.
Someone needs to figure out why we keep changing people around.
It was good company to work with but everyone is micromanaged all the time.
Dream Job.
I love my job and my coworkers.
Great opportunity for development that provides a great quality of life.
I would love to retire at this bank
but I also would like to move to another state.
I hope this bank moves to the state that I would like to move to.
Nice place to work.
It's a nice bank to work for.
They are more relaxed than their competitors.
Managers are nice and willing to help.
I enjoyed all the perks and benefits as well.
"Great Co-Workers, and I love the Job.  "
this bank has been a great company to work for however I cannot reapply into this bank with in the first year and I believe this bank's branch will be closing due to low customer usage.
"Otherwise, I would highly recommend this bank."
Loveable Enviroment..  
"this bank was a nice job, the only issue I have is with they policies and procedures of running the banking business."
"My job was to help customers around not only customers's bank accounts, but also credit cards, online banking, mortgage and loans."
Life at this bank.
I managed 5 people on the teller line.
I would start at 8 am and review the ATM cash balance and adjust accordingly.
I would complete schedules for the tellers.
I would also complete the training for new tellers which began at corporate in a classroom environment.
"I was in charge of all the operations in the branch which included ordering cash and cash supplies, rectifying customer issues, completing weekly schedules, and balancing the branch's on hand cash."
"When one of the teller's vaults came up short $20,000, a full investigation proceeded from which management decided that I was not trained well enough for my job and I was demoted to a teller."
"At that point, I wasn't making enough money to live and I had to leave."
I enjoyed seeing the same customers and developing a good relationship with the same customers.
I didn't enjoy seeing the deceit among employees which included suspicion or thievery as well as jealousy of pay grade and positions in this bank.
Productive.
"Great Place to work, normal day @ work would just be busy as always."
We learn something different everyday.
Management is good to work with.
My co-worker are the best.
Great opportunity and challenges along the way.
"For those willing to relocate, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement throughout the company."
the company focuses on customer faced interactions and encourages conversations and outside promotion.
Compensation is good for those with experience and quarterly incentives are obtainable if you work for the company.
Positive work experience.
"Over all, a good place to work."
"If you have tough skin and can take verbal abuse from immature customers, this is a good place to earn some paper."
"Must be a good researcher and problem solver, because the training provided is seriously lacking."
"On the other hand, upward mobility is always possible if you tough it out and adapt quickly."
Fast Paced.
I worked as a call center representative in it's member services department.
I spent most of my days on the phone speaking and assisting customers.
Flexible yet challenging.
Work on many different tasks with colleagues from different backgrounds.
Opportunity to lead and take initiative.
Flexible work arrangements after earning management trust.
Average place to work for.
A typical day would consist of 'morning huddles' that would consists of everyone's daily goals and additional comments on how we would achieve our individual goals.
The branch needs to meet a certain quota every day in order to maintain success - which was difficult depending on your tea.
Management was always very helpful and willing to assist Management's employees whenever needed.
"Depends on which branch you are work for their employees are hit or miss, but for the most part they're enjoyable and somewhat helpful."
"Hardest part: on boarding experience, if you're new to the banking industry it makes it difficult to meet the sales goals at first (but i believe that is true to most sales roles) Most enjoyable: meeting new people and helping new people achieve new people's financial goals"
Aggressive Sales Culture.  
this bank needs to make huge improvements in this bank's systems that support this bank's employees.
Cannot compete with big banks like Chase or BofA. There is no work life balance in the retail bank.
Upper management is clueless as to what happens in branches and what staff has to deal with.
Sales goals are very aggressive and sometimes unrealistic.
Exemplary Team Player and Manager.
"Over the years of my diverse work history, I have developed a very special management style."
"I treat all my teams] members, whether all my teams] members be peers or managers, with mutual respect and compassion."
"Because I believe that 'happy' employees and far more productive than folks who are unhappy at folks who are unhappy at their jobs's jobs, I make a point of satisfying all that is required of each person I come into contact with regardless of line of business, subordinate, or CEO."
The most successful companies are always the ones who have staffing that work together and enjoy what the ones who have staffing that work together and enjoy what they do do.
"I have done my best to practice a famous tenet of the late, great Maya Angelo 'I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made people feel.'"
"I will always make an attempt to leave a coworker, peer, boss, team leader, call center rep, or even my regional manager with a feeling of the fact a coworker, peer, boss, team leader, call center rep, or even my regional manager are in great hands and the rest outcome will be the result of our interaction."
work.
A typical day was i would come in and try to clock in if a computer was open then the manager would have me stand in the lobby for my whole shift unless someone in the branch wasn't someone in the branch's then i would cover for someone in the branch.
Nice place to work.
Always work open to close No overtime allowed Work 3 Saturdays a month Love my co-workers!
Too much micro management!
Love working with the public and helping people meet people's goals!
"Good for experience, but management will hold you back.."
I was a Teller with this bank for roughly 1 year.
"A typical day consisted of taking care of customers deposits, answering questions, providing assistance with any issues within my capacity to solve all while following corporate policies and procedures."
"While I was there, I learned to become comfortable providing a substantially higher level of customer service than ever before."
"I became able to practice and perfect selling products and services to people of many walks of life, and in exchange I also became a much more outgoing person."
I learned a lot about the banking industry (with some limitations) as well as the way that banks attempt to protect banks's customers from fraud.
"Management was a mixed bag; some days my boss would seem like a team player with a soul who wanted me to succeed, and on other days they would seem as if I was just another replaceable employee with whom they had limited tolerance due to the ramifications of unemployment insurance."
"Upper management was, in my best opinion, people in suits who saw entry level employees who barely did entry level employees who barely did their job, even if there was physical data to prove otherwise's job, even if there was physical data to prove otherwise."
My co-workers were the highlight of my time with this bank.
My co-workers are to this day some of the smartest people I have ever had the opportunity to work with.
The hardest part of my job as a Teller with this bank was the unrealistic sales goals and micromanaging.
"If you're reading this and considering working for this bank as a Teller, be prepared to learn that yesterdays successes become tomorrows expectations."
You will also be shocked to discover that although you might me - more...
Great Job.
I love working at this bank.
The people were perfect an this bank always showed this bank's employees appreciation.
I was so sad that the branch closed in my city.
meet lifelong friends.
I enjoyed daily interaction with co-workers and clients.
I was very good at sales and service; number 1 teller in Pittsburgh market.
Excellent.
"Excellent environment, best team, enjoyable job, great benefits, nice job culture, best practice, good training, deep knowledge, most innovative approaches"
Great Place to work.
"PNB Bank is a great place to work, employee appreciation, healthy environment, promotion opportunities."
"PNB Bank strive to educate and advance the success of PNB Bank's employees, and are committed to the success of the company as a whole."
Productive and challenging work environment.
"My typical work day was ensuring that the paperwork I received each day was properly completed and submitted to operations to be setup form Small Business Products that best fit our customers needs such as Pinacle Web, ACH, Wire Transfer, Lockbox, Remote Capture and Cash Vault Carrier Services."
"The most rewarding part of my job was my Customers, Treasury Management Business Banking and Business Banking Offers were satisfied with a job well done."
Productive and fun work day.
"Duties included: customer service representative, negotiate with client to set up payment arrangement on a past due bill, receive collection payment via telephone, data entry, answering a multi-line phone, verify demographic information for billing and payment arrangement and remaining calm while on the phone with a upset client about a upset client's bill"
Average place to work.  
this bank Equipment Finance offers limited room for advancement.
The training is very minimal and you have to be able to learn on your own.
No set guidelines or procedures you just have to figure it out as you go along.
Some area's of the business such as Documentation are always under staffed and over worked.
Some area's of the business such as Documentation is very high stress with no relief in sight.
They have silo mentality between business units.
It is very rare that knowledge is shared between business units.
Thinking outside of the box is some what discouraged.
It depends on your personality whether or not you would like this bank Equipment Finance as a place to work.
"If you like to just come in and do your task and go home then you will love this bank Equipment Finance, but it your a self motivated, problem solver this bank Equipment Finance is not somewhere you will be happy."
Overall working experience.  
this bank benefits are excellent and the staff really care about individuals.
I have been a long time employee and love working at this bank.
Big company.
"Can advance if desire, but nothing special.  "
this bank is a good company.
"On par with many other companies in terms of compensation, benefits, etc."
this bank are loyal to this bank's employees which is a good thing.
"Favoritism can play a role in promotion and management, but if you stick with Favoritism you can advance fairly easily (if you work hard and are competent)."
Technology is so-so
"and this bank like to think this bank are on the front of trends, but really seem to be in the middle of the pack."
why i had to leave.
"i started out truly enjoying the job, then all the ladies that i worked with at that branch quit, so the entire load was shifted to me, i was a part time 28 hour a week teller"
and they were working me 40-45 hours every week
and i was doing everything behind the teller line with very little assist from any team mates.
i asked them to transfer me to a branch that only needed a 28 hour a week part time teller but because it is against this bank procedure and policy.
after 3 months of no letup.
i quit.
this bank gave me the opportunity to grow as an employee..
I begin each day by greeting my manager and co-workers.
"We are a close knit, diverse team of talented individuals."
I strongly believe in starting the day on a positive note.
I arrive early in order to make sure that I'm logged on and ready to start on time.
I listen to my voicemail messages and then respond to any emails that were sent to me after business hours.
"My job title can be listed as Business Banking Collector, Default Specialist, Business Banking Customer Service Rep, or Special Assets Coordinator."
All of these titles are equally correct.
My job is much more than just calling people who haven't paid people who haven't paid their bills on time's bills on time.
I work with small business owners on a daily basis.
small business owners care deeply about small business owners's banking relationships.
"small business owners must be treated with the utmost respect, in order to ensure a healthy and mutually beneficial business relationship."
I always give my clients the benefit of the doubt.
I investigate the cause of delinquency before contacting anyone.
"I check loan agreements, branch notes, customer service notes and all recent payment transactions."
A big part of my job is to fix bank errors before bank errors become customer irritations.
There are many variables at play when investigating delinquency.
Adjustments are a positive alternative to collection calls.
"As a courtesy, I always contact the client's's Relationship Manager in order to make the client's aware of the necessary adjustments."
"However, there are times when the client's is simply not able to make a payment."
People react to the stress differently.
"Some clients lash out at the bank, but others simply ask for help. "

Great Place to work.
I learned to sell and talk with customer to see hat customer's personal need was as far as banking.
it more to bank teller then just cashing and depositing check.
you have a change to move up in the company by knowing the company
Higher management don't care.
Terrible place to work.
It is not about what you know its about who you know.
You can be the best candidate for a job but if Higher management just like somebody more then you.
to bad so sad.
Horrible.
Horrible place of business .
They give you hours over the phone once u get hired on they hours change they stick with an all day shift with no support.
productive and always a positive attitude.
I learned there are so many different personalities and different cultures in a work environment that not just work is the learning experience.
You learn how to work with other personalities some that don't want to work and how to make it enjoyable to help other personalities some that don't want to work enjoy work too.
Make every day a positive day to give someone else a brighter and more enjoyable day.
great place.
great place to work and the people at the job are all great people and managers.
Best part about the job is helping customers and there financial needs.
Good work Place.

this bank.
Multitasking on a day to day basis.
Work at a fast pace but with zero errors.
"Learned how to manage files and records, work with numerous computer screens at once."
View a customer financial needs in a way that this bank can benefit a customer.
The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers are satisfied with wait time considering this bank the short staffed.
The most enjoyable part is connecting with the customers on a personal basis.
Opportunity to make a lot of money.
"I don't have anything bad to say about any company, However, I also have nothing good to say about this one."
The management seems to be very negative.
"Instead of telling us 'you should know this' The management should have pointed us all in the right direction, hence the reason there is only 2 out of the 10 people left from training."
Training platform was very poorly setup.
Without support from our managers it was hard to succeed.
a lot of us did not wait around for that to happen.
Great location but a bad group of mentally unstable people who just do happened to become managers.
location was simply not ideal.
"i believe i would have had a different experience working for the company if i had been under better, more helpful management."
"productive, ambitious and willing to learn new things.."
I love to work with people...
My day to day life is very exciting...
I learn new things everyday and am willing to learn more...
I feel that the biggest investment that a person is going to make is purchasing a home...
I give my all and am hands on with my clients...
I take my job to heart and am there for my clients at all times even if it's after hours or on the weekend...
Great place to work.
Answering calls daily.
Everyone you work with is very easy going.
Very flexible and the company truly understands the meaning of family/work balance.
"Very supportive, collaborative, empowering place to work."
Very flexible work environment with opportunity to work remotely.
Work life balance and health improvement are very important.
Our team was fairly independent and a very friendly collegial group.
People company wide care about each other a lot.

"I had the opportunity to learn new skills in high end IBM storage virtualization, and to see the affects of storage tuning on the application environment."
"IBM is striving to stay at the cutting edge of technology to maintain very high levels of system availability, customer satisfaction, internal user support, and to reduce costs."
Great place.
Great place to work.
They care about their employees.
Keep employees informed of business progress.
Their room for advancement.
".. Great place to work, really enjoyed working for this company."
Everyone is very friendly and you are always learning and moving up.
Good company with multiple advancement opportunities.
"I do enjoy my job, however, I feel that I am not compensated fairly nor given proper merit increases on an annual basis."
I have been a loyal employee with this company for fifteen years.
"I have assisted both employees and customers through multiple changes such as the introduction of online banking, a major company acquisition, migrating transactions to innovative methods of banking tools, as well as many other corporate changes affecting branch banking."
I love the fast paced environment that is different everyday.
I have helped to develop an amazing team that makes work an enjoyable place to be.
I absolutely hate to leave but wish to be compensated for what I feel is my fair value as a marketable employee.
"I've worked for this bank for 25 years and enjoy working with my co-workers & feel that I have a fair boss,."
"Considering the above, recent corporate structure changes have made me seriously consider leaving this bank."
"While at this bank, I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience."
this bank.
My position is quite laid back and intense.
"However, there is no room for development and lack of management."
I learned that in order to move ahead I need to leave.
"Love their customers, but don't value their employees."
They love their customers but they do not value their employees at all there is 0 room for growth and development with his company they prefer to hire outside his company for open positions instead of promoting from within.
They take advantage of their employees and management treated like a number
You are just a number and management does not care about you.
I worked 7 years for this bank and management do not care about the work life balance of management's employees nor do management care about management's employees.
Great place to work for.
Processed bank reconciliations and financial reports to verify practice of proper due diligence.
Handled cash and deposits using the proper accounting procedures and documentation.
"Performed debit, credit and total accounts on computer spreadsheets/databases, using specialized accounting software."
Fun compnay.  
this bank is a fun company to work for.
"this bank definitely offer room to advance, but this bank pay very little and this bank's benefits are not great."
Vacation time could use a boost and so could medical.
"Other than that, great place to work!"
Great work Environment.  
this bank is a great work place.
Management was great.
Hours were flexible with my schooling.
Co-workers were great.
Hardest part was juggling between school and work.
Great Company to Work For Pro Work Life Balance.

I learn something new everyday it seems.
My co-workers are great with only one exception but only one exception is normal in the work place.
There is nothing hard about my job.
I love working there but My co-workers are down sizing.
The bank teller is an okay job to have.
The job in The job in itself is really not bad .
If you have a full staff of people and everybody does there part .
this bank just need to take a good look at there management staff and see why people really do not stay long .
Overall this bank is a nice company .
"Company satisfied with complacency, which permeates culture.  "
this bank offers a strong sense of work-life balance and accomodating work environment -- at the expense of compensation and benefits.
"An issues that is well known by those in power, but a taboo topic to discuss."
Middle management and upwards usually taken care of well with most of the lower ranks compensated below market rates -- citing 'cost of living' as primary justification.
"Top talent rarely attracted to this bank, and those that are, take positions primarily for non-work related personal benefits etc."
This was a good place to work..
I enjoyed see the daily customers & it was a great way to meet new people.
My co-workers are great people to know.
"I enjoyed working with My co-workers, it was like family."
Treats Employees like numbers.  
this bank does not care about this bank's employees.
It is a toxic work environment where managers only care about managers's own numbers and will fire any one that does not help managers advance managers's career.
Lack of support.
My experience with this bank was as a Summer Intern.
"I started bright-eyed and bushy tailed like the rest of my peers, constantly asking for feedback and doing the best that I could even though my manager I'd been assigned had passed me off to someone else before my first day even arrived."
"The hardest part of the job was trying to get my questions answered when there was no one available to answer my questions, and then being told my work wasn't up to this bank's standards after having a lack of support and feedback like I asked from the beginning."
"The company culture described to me was friendly and inviting and open to questions, however what I experienced was cut-throat, behind your back, every man for himself attitude."
"Watching Game of Thrones is one thing, playing Game of Thrones is another."
Productive and co-operative environment to work with.
As a QA career i was involved in portal testing as well as database testing.
"As a QA Analyst i attended walk through meetings with BA,Project Managers and QA Leads."
I have attended Requirement review meetings and provided feedback to BA.
"I checked for correctness,completeness and consistency and testability of Requirement."
Based on the requirements i wrote test cases and executed test cases.
I have logged and managed the defects as the defects were found using the defect module of HP QC.
"Once the defect was fixed,retested the defects and if passed,closed the defects."
If the defect was not fixed then re-opened the defects.
I attended defect assesment meetings.
"As far as testing is concerned i have performed Intergration testing,Adhoc testing."
Very Production Driven Environment.
I Enjoy working with the people that I work with the people that I work with make the job that has to be done every day a lot easier to do.
I also have managers that are willing to fight on our behalf for the thing that we feel would make our industry better.
Great place to work very flexible.  
this bank made your work environment very comfortable and enjoyable.
You get plenty of space for yourself and others to come and listen to your phone calls as well.
"A great company to work for who is focused on their employee's success to ensure business goals are met..  this bank Mortgage is a great company to work for; this bank Mortgage values this bank Mortgage's employees, customers and community relationships, this bank Mortgage is an organization that offers on-going training and professional growth; a company where you will be part of a strong team and have an impact in this bank Mortgage's overall success."
It is not what it used to be..
It started out great.
But after a month the interoffice politics and the adversarial atmosphere the interoffice politics created between the platform and the tellers was ridiculous.
Some managers were not professional while the Branch manager was great for the most part.
The pay did not make the situation any better for the amount of work they wanted done.
Poor planning for new system roll outs and no training on how to handle the back lash.
It was a mess.
I was even faulted for working 40 hours as a part time employee even though the Branch manager was responsible for scheduling and had asked me repeatedly to stay.
A Typical day at this bank on my position as Relationship Manager was one hectic day every day because my area dealt with loans that were in default.
A Typical day at this bank on my position as Relationship Manager was one hectic day every day because my area dealt with loans that were in default.
Productive place to work.
I learn everything about all the procedures you need to follow to work in a bank and run transactions.
The best ways to ensure your safety and the safety of the clients as well.
I also learned how to manage situations where you have a lot of customers to take care of in a short period of time and be attentive with each one.
I think that work for a bank is one of the best ways to learn and improve your customer service.
horrible company to work for.
Do not waste your time or efforts with this company.
this company could care less about you as an employee and expect you to sell sell sell!!!
Its very hard to sell for a company that you feel so horribly about!

The big company that treats you like a number not a person. provide the tools you need to advance with in the company but that's it.
Bank with great techology.

financial sales.
great company great people.
"Hours are in the middle of the day, scheduled 5 days a week open to close."
work almost every weekend
Not as nice as before.  
this bank used to be a wonderful place to work.
The people were great to work with and the atmosphere was pleasant.
That is no longer the case.
My last manager was a good person but the culture of this bank was cold and unpleasant.
Good work environment.  
this bank is a good work environment.
An average day consist of calling on realtors and my bank branch partners and meeting with customers who want to get approved to buy a home.

If you are not in upper management they treat like so poorly!!.
If you are not in upper management they treat like so poorly!!
On a monthly basis it changes from getting a good CIQ to clicking insight to multi channel calls.
No one is ever satisfied with anything.
Ive been here several years and ive gotten one pay raise which was nothing to get excited about.
ios development is easily handeled.
its a good company to use our skills and work development.all collegues are good to be a team player .management is cooperative with all team leads and members.

I learned a lot working there.
Management didn't like you asking questions.
My co-
workers
My co-workers were fun to work with.
The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with fellow co-workers and different clients.
Good people and tons of overtime.
A typical day at my job consists of getting to my computer and clocking in also bringing up all the systems we use to locate people in our date base.
Once thats done we log into the phone and start taking calls to help people with either fraud or disputes on people's credit cards.

My coworkers were amazing and great people to be around.

Busy high call volume call center taking calls all day.
I learned how to work with several programs.
Co-workers were great!
The hardest part of the job was explaining Escrow Most enjoyable part of the job was the people
Great learning environment.
"Tons of experience in a short time, but you are not compensated well High turn over, currently at 80%."
In most branches you will have to work until 12:15 on Saturdays.
"The co- workers are great, I made life friends here Most managers are insightful and understanding."
"Good benefits, flexible vacation, 401 K."
The hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything you have to do and dealing with changes constantly.
There are so many ways to mess up and people are let go a lot for mistakes.
productive workplace.
Setting appointments for customers to conduct a review at customers's local branch.
Also this job provides the opportunity to work with great people and make great friends with co-workers.
Great Place to work.
Big bank with a small bank feel.
Easy to move up in the company and everyone is extremely helpful in helping you to do so.
The girls I worked with are hardworking and great coworkers.
Management can use some tweeking but you have to make the most of your situation.
Behind the times.
The company doesn't focus on the things that are important and treats there employees like children who need threatened with punishment to perform.
The needs of clients have changed and The company does not keep up with the way people choose to do business and the employees are left making up the difference.
good work place with good management and coworkers.
A typical work day involves making and receiving phone call to and from customers who have gotten behind on customers who have gotten behind on their payments and need assistance's payments and need assistance.
"I review customers who have gotten behind on their payments and need assistance's information for accuracy, update any that might require it."

"I have obtained better leadership skills,have learned to offer better customer service,to be more engaging, and to have superb attention to detail."
We follow a lot of federal and industry guidelines and regulations so attention to detail and confidentiality becomes second nature.
Hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant changes on rules/regulations from management that sometimes contradicts its self.
"The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers, supervisors and the satisfaction that you get from knowing that you have helped someone in some aspect and that you have hopefully educated them to some degree."
High turnover at branch level.
"Poor training, misleading salary and incentive information.."
Careful with accepting offers here.
Ask for past history of incentives at branch you will be working at.
Very misleading.
Consuming and ever-changing demands..
"For my home life, the 1030am-730pm schedule, 7 days a week is just not practical."
"The days off change every week, as do the job duties and requirements."
"I have always been very adaptive to any occupation in my life, however the lack of consistency, and lack of apparent advancement opportunities have me feeling less than motivated to pursue further positions within the company."
"In addition to these cons, I felt somewhat misled about the job description during the interview process."
"I made significant sacrifices to accept the position and My direct management, and team members however, are the reason I have stayed on-board and continued to persevere."
"There are certainly some incredible people that do great work here, however, the business model, and overall job do not bring out the best in me, nor challenge my abilities."
Great Work Life Balance.
"Many opportunities to grow within the bank, while working with experienced and quality people who do not foster a cut-throat environment in the slightest."
"Workplace was in a positive environment, there was activities for employees when employees got a little stressed out."

Team of Analysts.
"Structured Team Environment i.e. BA, Developer, Architect, QA Manager and QA Analysts Worked in Agile environment by using 2 week sprints in SIT, UAT with a 3 week sprint with Prod Fix 1 week and Production."
Great company overall.
Great company as far as structure goes and making you feel like they care about you individually.
The catch though is if you make one small mistake they will not hesitate you let you go.
Productive place to work.

what I have learnd.
"I learned the ins and out of refreshing and imagining , reimagining , software deployment and banking system setup for tellers/management."
"nice management, need better pay.  "
this bank like any other bank provides no work/life balance.
Very inflexable.
"Though this bank is a large company, there is very little room to move upward in this bank."
"Management positions are held for a very long time, so it only leaves lateral moves with a very small raise if any."
Commission for sales could be better to supplement the low pay grades.
"Internal channel management in a fast paced, results driven organization."
"A typical day for me was driving 90% of the time, visiting a select group of retail bank branches to educate branch employees on the features and benefits of this bank Wealth Management."
"During these conversations, I helped to identify the right customers who could benefit, and provided conversational techniques that could be used to refer branch customers to this bank Wealth Management."
Often I made outbound calls directly and met with customers.
Throughout my career I created sales training materials that were effective in these activities.
"In addition, I created reports to measure progress toward sales goals, and analyze bottlenecks in the sales process."
"reports to measure progress toward sales goals, and analyze bottlenecks in the sales process tracked the value of the pipeline, number of referrals, and tracked closed sales."

I helped to set sales goals each year.

this bank Wealth Management is a fast-paced organization with very aggressive sales goals.
"High energy, flexible individuals would be the most suitable candidates for employees at this bank Wealth Management."
Managing.  
this bank is a great place to work.
I enjoy what this bank does for the staff and I love working for this bank for the past 23 years but I am looking for a change to use my Human Resource Degree.
Work/life is promoted extremely well.
The company supports and promotes work life program extremely well.
I would recommend employment workiing working mom and single family households.
Good.
"Very professional environment, very competent colleagues, great customers."
I learnt a lot about the challenges of working in a retail banking environment.
the hardest part of the job is achieving your goals flawlessly.
the most enjoyable part is the compensation and interaction with some colleagues.
all aspects of the branch.
Having good rapport with clients.
Doing what is right by the client.
Having conversations and knowing my client.
"Selling of banks products, and finding the client's needs"
Meet the needs of customers..
"Universal banker, multitasking between teller, customer service and platform desk on a daily basis."
"Learned how to cross sell bank products to customers, with the support of management on a daily basis."
Co workers were stressed to meet Co workers's quarterly goals.

service.
the management changed to frequently.

a typical day at this bank can be very fun and busy as the public can be in and out of the branches.

great team player.
helping peers understand day to day tasks.
peer assisted coac works well with other team playe able to work in a fast past environment
Not a career.
It's an okay job...
"it's very mind numbing, and the pay isn't that great."
You get federal holidays off and sundays which is nice.
Training was thorough and ongoing.
Senior Management assigned new tasks and were very thorough about training.
There were tasks that were time sensitive and it was sometimes challenging to work with that time frame
its never enough for this bank.
"pay is bad, work is non stop."
have to work 6days straight to get 36 hours.
3-4 hour shifts is a joke in my opinion.
Managers are asking to always due more
Would've Rather Sold Myself on Street Corner.
Street Corner was hands down the worst place
I have ever worked at in my life.
"Employees were angry, unmotivated, complained constantly and were full of drama."
The weasly manager was too busy with The weasly manager's thumbs up The weasly manager's rear to care.
The work environment is full of hormonal women out to eat each other alive.
"No breaks were allowed, you had to always come in early and stay late, often were unable to leave for lunch, and deal with angry coworkers and customers."
"Severely under-staffed, underpaid branch."
AVOID.
Typical Banking Place.  
this bank is a good place to break into the banking field.
The culture is very conservative where many people hold personal agendas and are uncomfortable with any younger professionals.
The work was monotonous.
"It was not encouraged to investigate new ways to complete items, nor was welcomed to ask 'why?'"
Management made decisions based on Management's personal opinion of a person rather than the quality of the work.
Dealing with The culture was difficult but I made some of the closest friends I could imagine.
Confused Workers.
I was on contract for windows 7 upgrade.
The manager in charge had no clue what was going on.
The manager in charge left a contract worker in charge.
The main goal was to do minimum work to keep contract going.
I was never given my own credentials to log in to the bank machines.
I had to log in with co workers credentials.
It seemed like most of the team was faking to make it.
Great job for customer service.
"If you have ever worked in customer service and sales, this is a great way to get into a M-F, 8-5 type of job."
Tellers make a bonus based on referrals for other bank products.
"Also, for scores based on calls to customers to rate customers's experience."
"Nice hours, good pay, great benefits, are a plus!"
Enjoy working for a corporate company; very fast pace and many changes..
I have been employed with this bank for the past 15 years and throughout my years I had multiple positions within this bank.
I began my career with bank N Bank back in 2001 until the merger with this bank NA.
"I enjoy working at this bank however, I feel its time for a change."
Great Place to Work.  
"this bank, is a great company to work for."
this bank has one of the best stock prices for a financial sector for the five years.
I have learned a lot about the banking industry while working for this bank for the last eight years.
"I have also, grown as a person while working there."
"I was just out of college, when I first started to work for this bank."
"I was not sure of what I wanted my career to be, but while thinking that I was being promoted almost every year with this bank."
"I have had a great career thus far, but I would also like to learn more about myself."
Customer care rep.
I love my job.
I connect with customer and coworkers.
The most enjoying part about my job is the customer.
I love helping the customer and hearing some of the customer's stories.
Flexible schedules and employee empowerment.
All good employees can make a difference in the company.
All good employees will give you a lot of responsibility if you request a lot of responsibility.
Management does listen to how employees believe something can be done better.
Ok.
The company has The company's struggles in the mortgage department.
I believe The company can do a better job with associate work life balance.
bank customer service rep./teller.
"basic teller duties: wait on customers, process customers's deposits, withdrawls, selling cashiers checks money orders, travelers checks, gift cards, redeem bonds, and sell bonds."

"sole control of branch cash including coin and sole control of ATM, night drop, main vault keys and combinations."
I wasn't always head and senior teller.
it was during my 21 years there at bank N Bank/ this bank.
Poor direct management.
I had to help others on my team with less experience due to our direct managers lack of leadership.
I was constantly answering questions of my co-workers which took time away from my responsibilities.
Productive work environment.
From the start of the business day to the close of business there is a constant flow of work production.
The ability to multi task is essential.
Policy and procedures are updated on a regular basis and one must be able to comprehend and adapt the new policy and procedures into the daily flow of work.
The management staff has a open door policy and make it possible for all employees to bring ideas and concerns to the table.
"Our co workers are not just team members, Our co workers are more like family."
The hardest part of the day is the day immediate changes must implemented and uncertainty arises but we do have a excellent supporting staff to assists.
Team huddles are a enjoyable part of the day.
Team huddles is when the teams come together and review previous day work numbers and give shout outs and offer encouragement for the day.
its a job.

my co workers are great.
its hard to move up and make more money.
ive learned a lot about mortgages.
the dos and don'ts when you are ready for mortgage.
ive met great people
Overall Good place to work.
There was opportunity to grow especially if you are willing to relocate.
They have several different locations you can work at in Ohio.
An ok place if you are into sales and a lot of work.
"Decent place to work, although they are very big on sales and can throw a lot of work and responsibilities at you it's ok."
Banking everywhere has changed they expect every customer that walks in to open several bank accounts and at times it can be overwhelming and not realistic.
And tend to put a lot of pressure on the employees.
Great entry level customer service call center position.
A typical work day consist of taking anywhere between 60-110 calls per day regarding account products and services.
It can be a very stressful environment to work in if you are not use to a high call volume call center.
Ive learned there is so much more to banks than checking and savings accounts.
"Learning how a bank account, loan, mortgage and credit cards actually work is knowledge that you can take with you for the rest of your life."
doesn't pay enough.  
this bank overworks and underpays you.
"Not much room for you to move up and when you do, this bank try not to increase your salary."
The management is also poor.
Small bank branch.
Small bank branch and no room for advancement.
Co-workers were helpful.
Good place as a first job.
Was fun working with customers.
Good place to work but no tamazing.
"Good place to work at but not amazing,,,benefits and compensation are pretty much standard ..with the industry not super competitive..."
fun working here.
Interesting people to work with.
Too much of Hispanic orientation in my branch.
this bank need to expand this bank's customer base.
Learn t a lot about financing.
Great People.
"Great Co -Workers, Fast paced working environment."
Customer's ar are coming in and would like to be taken care of as quickly as possible with accuracy.
Pushes sales over anything else.
the company claim to be a good company but the company push sales so much that all the managers are stressed and upper management is micro managing the banks.
I was let go after having no write ups and being with the company for a year and a half.
Over a small complaint.
the company shut down branches left and right and change a branch into 'universal' then let you go if you don't want to work at a branch.
Overall bad experience..
The experience was very unpleasant.
The salary was poor.
There was no real appreciation hard work.
I left the company after three years.
Leader in Banking & Financial Services Industry.
There really was no 'typical' day at work.
Everyday had a new challenge and lots of variety.
"The dynamic culture of Banking & Financial Services Industry allowed me to develop outstanding customer service skills, learn how to communicate and how to manage & deal with change."
Had some co-workers that were eager to learn and others just putting in others's time.
The hardest part of the job was dealing with the politics of such a huge conglomerate.
The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and getting to know my customer base and vendors.
"Great company, amazing experience."
Great company to work and learned new things everyday.
Team work is the key and this bank is remarkable.
My manager was very supportive learned an experienced so many new things learned how to balance job life and personal life Mixed culture and great environment.
Job continually changing so every day there's a new way to do your job.
Interview was misleading.
Earnings exaggerated..
Micromanaged.
Seem to view their people more like numbers or sheep that are herdable and dispensable.
Regularly under-staffed at all levels.
Co. feels bland and hostile.
Don't recommend Co. to anyone.
RBC Bank was acquired by this bank.
Great bank..
Commercial lending position.
"Cold call, service clients, cross sell, credit underwriting."
At that time credit had a local presence.
Good company for which to work.
Going through some changes but overall a good experience..
Good company for which to work.
Going through some changes but overall a good experience.
Overall management was good allthough there were a number of reorganizations in the short time I was there.
Worked with some very good people
Productive place to work at.
"It's a great place to work, there's still a lot of room for improvement especially in the technology field"
but it's a bank with great values and a friendly work environment
I already reviewed this company..  
this company is a large corporation.
this company is spread out throughout the country.
There are many opportunities if you want to move out of your state.
stressful sales goals.
8 hour or more work days.
learned a lot about being a supervisor as back up.
management really only looks out for management.
co workers were good except a few bad apples.
hardest part of job were unrealistic expectations.
most enjoyable part would be the wonderful client base
Would not recommend working for this bank.
this bank have a survey system in which you need to have a 4.8 to a 5 to be green.
If you aren't corporate will not get off your back.
You have very little control over what the customers say on these surveys; many times the customers aren't even rating you as an employee.
"the customers are rating this bank, or a different employee."
Some people give all 4's because Some people don't believe anyone can be perfect and that everyone has room for improvement.
It's a rolling score so all 4's's will mess you up for the next year.
There was a time when my co-worker got a 2.8 because a customer was convinced the upgrade that was done for a customer was the reason a customer subsequently had a customer's identity stolen.
I had another co-worker get a 2 because our branch wasn't handicap accessible.
The comments to these surveys come out a few weeks after the fact and corporate does not care if the bad score you got was not your fault.
"Completely unfair system, way too much pressure."
They continuously punish you and make you feel terrible about your scores if your scores aren't good even if you try really hard to do well.
Corporate spends tons of money on ideas that don't work.
"When employees give feedback about things not working employees do not care, employees just say do things not working anyway which leads to people wasting tons of time trying to make it look like people are using the tools that corporate wants people to even when people aren't because the tools that corporate wants them to don't make any sense."
They under pay all of their employees The bright spot was that I loved the people in the branch that I worked.
the people in the branch that I worked were like a family and the people in the branch that I worked worked together to get the job done.
the people in the branch that I worked - more...
One of the better places I've worked for.
Schedule and benefits were great.
"Job was challenging and always changing, but never too hard to finish."
Leadership was fun to work for.
Results driven sales enviorment.
Analyzing client needs using consultative approach.
"Full financial management including portfolio, planning, trust, and backing services"
Teller.
General duties included securing the back and processing customers withdrawals and deposits while delivering excellent customer service.
this bank is a good starter company and is good for people who are looking for a chance at stability..
A typical day at work consist of opening the branch and setting up an interactive activity to attract customers.
This position can be a lot of fun if you are grouped with the right set of co- workers.
The most enjoyable part of This position is the interactions with customers and being paid to be a part of games from time to time.
"However, the hardest part of This position is meeting monthly sales goals from time to time."
Great Place to Work.
I could not have been happier with my time at this bank Mortgage.
this bank Mortgage was a great opportunity which I found to be very helpful for my career.
Management really strives to be great.
poor leadership manages team with fear.
Do not work here.
You will be very unhappy.
Everyone complains and human resources does not care.
It is all about pushing products and never getting praise for what you do.
Leaders play favorites and treatment is different for Leaders.
A decent company.  
"this bank is a decent company to work for, but this bank do not pay very well for the amount of work employees are expected to do."
It is also difficult to move up depending on which department you are in.
Great company.
Great working with people & customers.
Learned a lot about the Automobile industry.
A very rewarding job.
Great place to work.
Great working experience.
Enjoyed working with people and customers.
"a typical day at work allowed me to be helpful to customers, Great experience in customer service."
Productive and very productive team members.
"I love working here because it is so cool and pleasant place to work with folks, productive environment, fun place, good location"
Highly professional enviornment with people willing to help.
Work is worship for me.
Love TEAM work environment
My typical work day is meeting my clients understand my clients's needs and providing solutions and at the same time make sure that I win my clients's trust and confidence.
My management and co-workers were superb.
Working with clients always enjoyable and never had a negative feeling about my job.
Good entry level position..
"If you are just starting off this is a good job for you, especially if you are a great salesperson."
They don't offer full time positions.
They rarely ever promote within.
They pay is the lowest in the industry.
High sales demand on tellers is stressful.
"They don't give Christmas bonus, no perks like free lunch or free anything."
Management has even suggest that we pay out of our own pocket to buy things for customers to show customer appreciation.
They strong arm us to make donations out of our own pocket.
"Many of the tellers qualify for welfare because of the low wages The healthcare is horrible, prescriptions are not covered."
"You are only given two personal days per year in the first year, for sick or vacation you only get two days."
High turn over rate because the company does not treat the company's employees very well would be my guess.
Recently acquired position.
The job culture is cool & The job culture's all about learning new products & services.
Personally it fits someone who is customer oriented and willing to handle person to person interaction.
n/A. Not a good environment to work in.
Compensation is extremely low compared to other companies with the same duties and responsibilities.
Management does not care about the concerns of the employees.
No room for financial advancement.
"Good Bank to work for I still use Good Bank to work for as my bank..  Good Bank to work for, was a great entry level position into the bigger world of fraud and financial fraud."
I learned so much I was able to take financial fraud to tax fraud.
Fast Pace.
"Opened new accounts: saving, checking, and loan manage and operate the teller line."
Answer the phones as well as make everyday calls.
Solid company.
It has been to write a review for this company under this company's present management.
I do remember that this company was well run and offered long term employment.
great place to get started in sales..  
this bank is a good place to get started in sales.
this bank have a great work life balance schedule and many branches to choose from.
Steady Career.  
this bank offers job security but without a degree is very hard to land a promotion.
Had bad managers and fantastic managers.
Large company with good benefits.
Great Company.

The executive assistant role was a challenge but a welcome one.
I enjoyed the fast paced environment.
The executive assistant role was a great fit for me.
Financial Sales Consultant.
"Great job, gave me the experience that I needed in sales and customer service."
I became very educated in the loan process and all the products available to customers in order to make customers's financial goals become a reality.
Always seeking room for improvement.

A very motivated and dedicated individual who is takes great pride in everything I do.
Always willing to learn and work as a team.
"I am always ready to take on a challenge as well as overcome a challenge -Patience, Respect, Recognition and Fairness. - Talented, and willing to learn and work as a team."
"- There is no hard part to my job, all challenges turn out to be a life lesson for growth and development -"
My teams my most enjoyable part of my job as well as my clients
"Very Corporate, difficult to advance."
I started working for this bank back in september at the call center.
It's a very high stress environment and a lot of broken promises.
The management is poor and inexperienced.
Management should be required to hold a customer service position for at least 6 months before being awarded a Team Lead position.
"SO many miscommunications happen on a day-to-day basis, especially when it comes to following company procedures and federal law."
"Definitely not the best bank to work for, but an ok place to start your career or work at later when you've advanced."
Get ready for quick 30 minute lunch breaks and staying at adherence.
Its a bank.
Worked in the operations side of the bank and found a lot of long-tenured and heavily entrenched people.
Some of whom were great people Be ready to put in your time before efforts are recognized.
Advancement and opportunities are heavily dependent on you ability to leverage your network in the compnay
production.
A typical day of work include plenty of paper work.
The most enjoyable part of the job is having variety duties.
The management team worked closely with the staff.
Horrible Company.
You do not want to work for this company!
"You are told one thing during the interview and training process but once you are in your branch, everything you were promised goes right out the window!"
Challenging work involving multi-tasking.
#NAME?
#NAME?

"The most enjoyable part of the job was multi-tasking, calculating document terms and closing out files"
fun and loving evironment.
many responsibilities from opening the branch to closing the branch.
balance your drawer and taking care of copious amount of money.
Great place to work.
"Great culture, co-workers were very accomplished and talented Growing too fast and losing sight of individual employees accomplishments."
Supports other organization.
"A very inviting and well kept place, it's once you're in reality hits."
Pay rate do not match work load.
Lack of quality control.
Inadequate training
Unprofessional workplace.
I usually never review anything unless I am extremely satisfied or extremely disappointed.
"It is very unfortunate to say, that this is by far the worst company I have ever worked for."
"I have never felt so humiliated, discriminated against, and out of place with any other employer in my past."
The lack of open-mindedness and education in the environment are clearly a big issue and greatly contribute to the high level of unprofessionalism observed within the retail banking sector.
"None of the promises I was made in the beginning of my career ever became a reality, and it did not take long to realize that the only reason I was hired was because they needed bodies, not because they valued my experience, skills, and me as an employee."
I am beyond disappointed and would not recommend to anyone with education beyond high school level.
A up and coming banking institution.
The goals and strategy of the company are there however the technical aspects such as the systems the company use to do your job are lagging.
Plenty of opportunity available within the company.
Always short on staff which made it impossible to leave on time for family.
Typical day at work is from about 8:30am-5:30 or 6pm depending on if fully staffed or not.
Hardest part of the job is not able to work freely but being micromanaged.
"Cannot get more than 10% raise per year, so if you got promoted you are stuck with whatever salary you earned."
Sweat shop.
Sweat shop demands a lot from the employees and pays absolutely nothing.
HR lies about pay to get you in the door.
Sweat shop is an outdated lockbox that need to invest better equipment and a better process.
productive work place.
great work place with amazing co workers doing the total QA process we learned together working in agile environment with developers
"Structure, secure work environment."
"Surrounded by high-quality talent, which is a great environment for personal development."
Talent development processes are robust and detailed.
"Career progress is ok, Internal mobility program affords great exposure across all- markets."
Good place to Work.
Enjoy working here the pay is great and good benefits and vacation time off.
Fast paced environment
and must be able to adapt to change.
fast pace.
"Teller processing fast paced, check cashing, deposits issue monetary instruments (cashiers checks, money orders etc)."
"Supervise branch team members, maintain branch scheduling, order of branch supply needs."
Fun and exciting experience.
Working for this bank allowed me to increase my knowledge on consumer and small business lending.
I was also able to learn more about the day to day operations of banks.
na.
Why is this bank unable to retain good and dedicated employees?
Why does this bank MICO Manage?
Why does this bank promote employees that have not social qualities and communication skills?
ok.
Bank has turned into sales to much.
Customers do not like it.
I like to make customers happy and want to come back.
Not unhappy that customers are being harassed for new products every time customers come into Bank.
Not your ideal teller job.
I worked there for three months before they decided to lay me off.
"First off, the training was not thorough."
"Second, when I asked for help, I would either get ignored or they would get mad at me."
It was underpaid for the work that was required.
The management was low and disrespectful.
My manager was rude to me in front of clients and would make me look stupid and unqualified for the job.
I felt worthless and unappreciated even though I tried my best to enjoy the job.
try to make a transfer.
"Design and deploy employee /benefits census report, benefits statements report, enrollment count summary report, billing report and other insurance / payroll file transfer reports by using SSRS and SQL Server 2005 / 2008"
Good company.
I have been at Good company over 3 year at a teller .
I really have a lot of experience such as how to communicate with clients well and understand the power of team work.
Excellent environment and great employee benefits.
Very professional and took great concern on training their employees so the customers had a great and positive experience.
Low Pay.
Low Pay is horrible for the positions.
You spend years working your way up and still make nothing compared to other banks.
"bank N Bank, now this bank."
"Working for this bank, formerly bank N Bank, was enjoyable and provided me with personal and professional growth."
Outstanding management and employees.
Enjoyed positions both part-time and full-time.

Program Development Assistant Manager.
"Everyday is filled with purpose, productivity and achievement."
"Working closely with program candidates, Hiring and on boarding journey,project management."
Time management can be the most challenging however with organization and great time management.
Great place to start entry level.
great place to work.
Just sales based mostly.
The best training I have had in a long time.
You have a chance to move up if you do your job well.
Great place to work..
For this bank I assisted with sales of different financial services to provide financial solutions to consumer and business concerns.
My time with this bank was a great learning experience with great training from this bank university.
this bank help me learn how to sale with confidence and provide five star customer service.
Due to frequent growth in this bank this bank provided new challenges daily requiring me to approach new responsibilities spontaneously.
this bank was a really team oriented work place having to work with my team to deliver quality client experience.
Hardest part about this bank was management turnover this bank provided challenges having to learn new ways to adjust to exceptions.
The most enjoyable part about my job was building relationships with customers to resolve financial problems.
Overall this bank was a great experience.
Excellent Learning Experience.
I was able to obtain and learn a lot of professionalism and customer service from this bank.
"Day to day was hectic, usually handling about 200 to 300 calls."
"When promoted to a Tier 2 became more tedious in correcting many mistakes by lower level employees, many stressful calls and constant volume."
Very high turn over in employees made it hard to maintain a good culture in the workplace.
Terrible Compensation.
Sub market compensation strategy.
Failed pay for performance implementation.
No possibility for financial growth with firm.
"No bonuses until Vice President level (minimum 5 years), departments limited to 1% annual raise."
Don't expect for your salary increases to outstrip inflation until you get pay your 5-10 year of dues to qualify for bonuses.
"Poor Management, no room to grow."
"Job was great, no management, no room to grow."
Pushed sales.
Management did not address concerns about anything.
No one took ownership
Great work life balance.  
this bank is wonderful with thinking about this bank's and employees well- being to be an successful company to work for.
Working for this bank.
I've been working for this bank for a little over 12 years.
I can honestly say that I do not have any negative feedback to report.
I come to work daily to a good working atmosphere.
At 6 AM I run my daily totals reports.
"Next I began logging in work for a team of 35 Statement Spreaders, then I log out all of a team of 35 Statement Spreaders's completed work and finally I take a look at supplies that may e running low and make sure our printers and faxes are working properly."
I have a great relationship with my manager and my coworkers.
"In fact, my manager knows that I am looking for employment outside of this bank because our opportunities for advancement aren't as high as our opportunities for advancement use to be in previous years."
The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to come in at 6 AM because I get to leave at 2:30 PM which lets me schedule all of my appointments for after I leave work.
I also enjoy the conversations I have with the diverse people in our group.
Was a good place to work just very hot.
It was a good place to work to start out.
I enjoy the people that I worked with.
I did learn a lot working there and had the chance to learn how to open accounts and do loans as well as wait on customer at the teller line.
Friendly Culture.
The overall workplace is very nice.
Clean environment and supportive management.
Colleagues are very friendly and willing to help you.
Excellent place to make contacts to move career path internally.
Productive Fast Pace.
Good working environmen
Fast Pac Learning new actions with every transactio only negative is hard to advance in movement
this bank.
While working at this bank downtown it was amazing experience.
The management was excellent but it was also a fun atmosphere to work for.
wouldn't recommend call center every other department I worked in was great.
I enjoyed all departments i worked in except call center.
I worked in various departments during my time there.
call center was the most demanding and most stress-full place.
Pressure from supervisors and managers was to much along with the customers being nasty and mean.
Great Bank.  
Great Bank is a great company to work for .
"The WorkPlace Banking department was a wonderful department, The WorkPlace Banking department care about you as an employee."
Summary.
I loved working in a restaurant it was completely different from wjat I had ever done.
"I had to take orders and prepare food, clean the kitchen keep inventory and ordering train new staff."
I enjoyed providing excellent customer service and I had a wonderful management team that I worked for
Ok position.
Management id ok.
The work environment is very quiet but weird.
"There is not much, if any communication between coworkers."
Not really a team environment.
Focused on Customer Satisfaction.
Management was great and gave you credit when you deserved credit!
The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and non-compliant customers.
I had great co-workers and so my day was always fun and exciting!
The hours were great and there was always room to grow in the company.
Management not very friendly.
Could be a good place to work..
There are a lot of managers that are not very nice and do not talk to associates.
this bank tries to promote employee engagement but it doesn't go very far when Management seems out of touch with the associates.
The talent seems to leave either due to Management or due to compensation.
"I liked working for the company, but policies need to be reviewed and changed.."
"I enjoyed working for this bank, I had many customers that are loyal to me Most days at the branch were busy."
this bank have had a lot of change with co-workers.
Hardest part of the job was keeping on track and getting customers waited on.
I loved my customers.
N/a. Not applicable Job Work/Life Balance Not good.

Decent place to work.
I worked for this bank for three years.
"this bank's call center is a great place to work, however, this bank's branches are full of shady politics and unethical practices."
"I was let go when this bank found another person that could do my job at 5 branches for $10,000 less per year than what I was making."
"this bank let go 9 total people in the area when this bank closed the branch, and fired all of 9 total people in the area before the day before the branch closed so that 9 total people in the area could avoid having to pay severance."
"When we all went to file for unemployment, this bank told unemployment that we were all let go due to insubordination - which unemployment quickly caught on to and made this bank Pay us unemployment."
"I heard that a few lawsuits were filed, but I did not get involved."
Difficult environment with no room for advancement.
"Harsh, difficult, and cheap environment where pushing EPS is the only goal."
No respect for 'back-office' finance workers who ensure governmental guidelines.
"Inept managers who are not in a position to lead or manage, but simply drive results, whatever the cost."
Management.
Management for this position wasn't the best.
Management for this position hired out of the department for supervisor positions which created multiple issues.
If you needed explanations on anything you had to bother senior members and interrupt senior members's work as the supervisors had no idea what was going on.
Management only knew how to look at charts showing your workload and assign work as needed.
Not much help for anything else.
Turn over is about 100% in most branches.
They sell you on what a great opportunity it is to work there.
But then you get there and everyone else is rushing back out the door past you.
"After a few weeks, you begin to understand why."
"Ok Company, need better pay."
Company is ok to work for.
The location I worked for was very slow
but we still had to have the same amount of referrals as the busy locations.
this bank is one of the lowest paying banks in the area.
I could have easily went to another big bank and made extra $2 an hour.
this bank have pretty good benefits however and some pretty good incentives.
Disappointing management and employee appreciation.
The bank is planning on converting to virtual banking despite negative reviews.
The plan is to fire employees randomly and reduce the expenses There is no social responsibility in such a management.
Absolutely great atmosphere to work in and always felt positive once you walked in the door..
Everyone was very positive when they were in the building.
The teamwork there was as strong as any team I had ever been a part of.
I really enjoyed being there every day and was pushed to be the best I could be at my job by my manager.
Constantly striving for improvment.  
this bank is willing to try the latest tech and will rethink the wheel - internal processes are always being improved and this bank listen to frontline employees who suggest solutions.
Productive and exellent customer service.
A good company to work for .
positive and supportive management and colleagues .
Training in all areas within the bank are offert and a lot of challenging and exciting projects
Professional Environment and Friendly Cowokers.
I have not meet a single person at this bank who has not seemed content with their jobs.
They are all very friendly and seem to have a good life/work balance.
The atmosphere is welcoming and this bank seems to value this bank's employees.
There is of course a lot of paperwork that needs to get done and the learning curve for their particular way of doing things is very high.
"There does appear to be some turn over, but some turn over is usually from people leaving for other jobs, from what I can tell."
A lot of standing but to be expected as an usher.
Worked to greet customers while developing skills in customer service.
Showed customers to customers's seats and dealt accordingly with occurring issues as such.
good.
This bank was great and had good customer service.
A lot of focus was on selling the services providing by This bank.
Customers were very pleased and didn't feel pressured.
Great job.
Typical day is busy.
I have learned so much from dealing with a variety of people to how to do technical work on the computer.
Consistently reinforce growth.
Great products and services.
"Very conservative when approving loans, even for mass affluent."
Embrace multiple bank cultures in attempt to find their own persona.
Strong family oriented environment.
Difficult work environment.
Job work/Life balance was great.
However the location I worked for was not easy.
Too many people setting new people for failure.
I felt I always had to watch my work.
Very stressful.
Do not care about employees.
When this bank bought bank N Bank it felt as though it were the other way around.
"bank N Bank Managers wanted nothing more than to get rid of this bank staff and when my daughter became ill and was in the hospital for 4+ months, bank N Managers struck and I was let go."
FMLA did not protect me.
My manager was heartless.
Very Busy.
"The branch I am located is very busy, you're constantly learning with training, co-workers are great, you deal with a lot of customers on a daily basis sometimes you can only feel you don't even get paid enough."
It can be a very stressful job.
Big Bank.
"As a loan officer at a big bank, my responsibility is to provide services for local branches and self gen business."
Pay is fully 100% comission.
"Management lacks strong leadership skills, is indecisive, and often unwilling to do whatever it takes to close a loan (within regulations)."
this bank has been the financial institution of choice and provides a rewarding and educational job experience..
The working environment is corporate and yet family friendly at the same time.
"While this bank is large, this bank is not overwhelming in size and locations in the United States are found within certain pockets along the east coast and southern states."
The atmosphere is team oriented and easily adaptable to new employees.
Fun People.
"Limited Opportunities for growth and development in the field of retail banking, high turn over in staffing."
therefore staff lose interest in working for the company
"Cool Idea, Poor execution..  "
this bank focuses on maintaining a work/life balance and creating an inclusive culture for all employees and customers.
However at the branch level this is poorly executed.
During my time at this bank I was forced to make 10+ sales calls per day.
I was also forced to push product and services on every customer regardless of whether every customer had a need or not.
Best part of the job was commiserating with my coworkers.
Also formed a special connection with a few customers.
this bank.
"Great job to work for, no plans on living just trying to find another job to supplement my income and that is compatible with the hours I am already working here at this bank"
Great.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
I would encourage anyone looking to get into retail banking to consider applying.
I learned a lot about finances and lending.
I actually liked my position!!.
Until this point I've never worked in a call center!!!!!
Its definitely a lot of information to cover but once you get a handle on how things work its a piece of cake.
you get incentive for quality calls and schedule adherence and paid holidays :-)
However my current schedule just isn't conducive to my family life
this bank review.

Good work-life balance.
Could use more professionalism.
Terrible place.
I worked at this bank For 2 years tho this bank had this bank's good times there was far less of its good times then bad times.
First they train you that this bank is all about this bank's employees and this bank care about you.
It's a lie this bank care about you if your not a teller.
Second sales oriented ok
I understand all companies are about making money but at a bank you always see the same people
so it's frustrating when you shove credit cards down the throats of the same people every week then when the customer flips out on you for annoying the customer it's your fault for not positioning the 'conversation' correctly.
Third the amount your salary is at this bank is peanuts for the amount of stuff your required to do.
And if you end up in the Lehigh valley region in pa your job is threated daily if your not performing to expectations.
The amount of stress I endured working there cause me to develop medical issues that I now take pills to prevent.
And the high deductibles from there insurance plans didn't make it easy for me to get medical attention for the issues developing from The amount of stress I endured working there.
So all and all my experiences at this bank the only good thing was I was traveling 5 miles to work.
this bank.
Benefits are ok- only high deductible health plans available.
There are lots of opportunities to move into other positions.
Vacation and work from home are good in most areas of this bank

I loved my co workers and the work but felt I was stuck and felt unfulfilled.
Fun place to work with.
Great place to work.
I was able to advance fairly quickly but also had to work very hard.
Knowing that work hard=play hard.
I can consider being here for may years.

Lousy working to life balance.
Income ratio is well off base for job descriptions.
I have no further comments on this horrible company.
Great Entry Position.
Top Management and work culture.
Easy to find mentors and amazing employee benefits and retirement plans.
The opportunities to grow internally may come with challenge.
The technology and training programs available are the best and you can tell JPM made a strong commitment and investment to JPM's training and recruiting.
Functions and process seem to change daily.
"Great management and team, however I need something more flexible which will provide a better home/ work balance and less commute."

As a Senior Documentation Administrator I was responsible for validating the receipt of and filing commercial loan documentation.
"I serviced our internal and external partners across various lines of business by fulfilling copy requests, validation of original documents, file pulls and processing the temporary release of files to the Asset Resolution Team and this bank legal."
Additional responsibilities included imaging and data entry of commercial loan documents.
imaging and data entry of commercial loan documents were performed using a variety of systems.
Extremely rigid accountability standards made it difficult to work under pressure to meet daily service levels and deadlines.
"As a strong team player, I found the most enjoyable part of the job was establishing a level of trust among teammates while forming lasting relationships."

I would never recommend anyone working for The management.

"extremely low pay, horrible management,no advancement for 'minorities'."
The company does not pay a living wage ( check Salaries for yourself before applying) .
Lots of hard work for not much compensation.

Productive fast growing company.
"the company acknowledge your hard work, including employee appreciation week."
"I enjoyed my time within the company great, colleagues."
enjoyable work environment.  
this bank is a well managed company to work for with great room for advancement throughout the widely known financial institute.
"Productive, professional, fun workplace with great incentives."
Fun work place with supportive management.
"Not all about the numbers, but how you personally grow and develop."
"Efficient amount of red tape and politics, but it comes with the territory."
"The most enjoyable part of the job was working along side positive, upbeat, and helpful individuals in every position."
The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult consumers without seeming contradictory.
"A typical work day there would be taking calls of course, attending necessary daily meetings, acknowledging and applauding employee achievements,and implementing ideas to enhance customer experience."
Fast Pace Teller.
First day at work and Im already into a fast pace environment.
I love the people and the how the company takes cares each other.
Obsolete Managers.
"There are no leaders or mentors in my region, managers are very lazy and have personal relationships outside of work The hardest part of the job is dealing with management who rely on low wage employees to meet goals and oversee branch operations."
"Great benefits, low pay grade.  "
"this bank is a fantastic place to work, there is a lot of room to grow and improve in your role."
The benefits and home life are amazing however there is a high volume of turn over and excessive rulechanges.
overall this bank is a great place to but youve got to be able to handle a lot of change and low pay.
You build a relationship with your customers..
You get to meet really cool people.
It's a challenging job in committing to your goals.
You get to learn a lot from specific roles if you are willing to learn.
Teller Rep. Worked as a travelling teller in the North Region.
I got the opportunity to see many different branches and develop an understanding of how retail banking works and how each branch finds a way to adapt to each branch's surrounding community I really enjoy the company and would recommend the company to anyone as far as my experience goes.
Great Culture..  
this bank has done a great job creating an team based workplace.
Employees are provided with training to further Employees's knowledge of bank practices.
Enjoyed my time with this bank.
Opportunities for advancement are readily available.
Good place to work.
Enjoyed the wins in sales.
Spoke to corporate financial directors to explain the process of accepting purchasing cards for payments.
Enjoyed interacting with company representatives gaining trust and accomplishing sales goals.
Management.
Management is not very good there.
Management think the answer to everything is more conference calls and Management like to fee customers to death.
Building a brand new book from 'ground zero'.
The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and accomplishing our goals each week.
I also enjoy my clients.
I take great pleasure in customer service and keep my clientele very satisfied.
"I meet my goals not only quarterly, but annually."
Management has a tremendous amount of red tape and politics!
an ok place to work..  
"this bank is a great place to work, but the universal banker role should have more training."
"I think, if the universal banker role were more hands on and interactive, that would help too."
Overall this bank's an ok bank to work for.
Relaxed and Employee and Customer Focused.  
"this bank is a great company to work for, this bank offer job advancement and strived to keep the balance of customer service for the clients and employee work life balance"
"Eh, not too shabby."
Not a bad place to work.
But they are definitely very parsimonious in comparison to other banks.
High expectations for very low pay.
Solid Company but lacking in advancement opportunities.
A typical day for me consists of early morning conference calls followed by outside sales activation.
Everyday my work location varies based on events scheduled for the week.
I've learned how to juggle personal sales goals and management of a sales force including relationship building within a large market.
Management doesn't seemed to be aligned with customer facing employees throughout the market which is a key factor in me seeking new employment.
There is a very high turnover of employees in the company which makes it difficult to establish best practices that lead to positive results.
The hardest pat of my job is having to deal with so many different personalities without any real support from my direct management.
Philadelphia is the largest market in the company and I'm equipped with a team of four to meet the demands of such a large network.
The best part of my job is that I am not tied down to any office as I am part of a mobile team.
I love the freedom to create my own schedule and the opportunity to travel and experience different types of events.
Too far from Parent company.
"I worked for this bank for a short time, but because this bank don't have a local presence it felt like we were out on an island."
Othewise very typical bank experience.
My first job.
My first job was very nice place to work in .This was place where i started my career as QA tester
and i learned most of my skills .Other
team member were very nice to help me and teach me real world working rules.
lead a team in the financial industry.
rally a team to find opportunity in existing clients financial needs.
work with small business bankers to identify and create banking relationsips
Professional work environment.
Very supportive management.
Training for the job is adequate.
"Supportive team mates and business partners, Large sales territory, a lot of travel."
"Productive, but slow work environment."
As a previous employee of this bank I would like to thank this bank for the opportunity within this bank's company.
Saying I learned a lot would be an understatement.
this bank kept me constantly growing as an individual in my work environment.
Managers with outstanding leadership skills aided me throughout my this bank journey.
It definitely enhanced my verbal and communication skills.
"Fun place, this bank had a lot to offer."
1 hour breaks too.
"this bank was a great place to work at, however you would have to jump through hoops getting software you needed."
The bad thing about this bank was that I had to frequently travel to Pittsburgh.
Productive place to work for.
productive place to work for.
Very fun and diversified .
work and life balance.
your feedback is always appreciated .fast pace and fun to work for
"Great benefits, but unsure if this bank can hold up the remaining mess....  "
this bank is not a bad company to work for.
"Great benefits are, in fact, rather exceptional, with health, vision, dental, and even a 401(k) plan matching at 4%."
"A lot of times, however, it does appear that upper management seems to be running in circles."
"I work in the branch in downtown Mechanicsburg where this bank's regional manager's office resides, so you'd think upper management'd have a more keen sense on what's going on - upper management don't."
"this bank's regional manager is up a flight of stairs no more than 10 steps, and our regional manager's JUST learned my name a few weeks ago - I got hired in February and it's now the end of October."
"When it comes to the sales side of things, it's not difficult to make goals."
You do get a nice compensation depending on what job position you take.
If you're in it for a bit of 'commission' then you're better off going for a Financial Sales Consultant role and should steer clear of a Teller or Customer Service Associate.
"Depending on how many accounts you open, credit cards you sell, loans you apply for, or even referrals you submit, you'll earn $6."
"You could spend 10 minutes opening an account for $6, where at the same time you could apply for a loan, have to keep an eye on a loan for weeks, keep in contact with them and up to date about a loan, and set yourself reminders to continuously observe the status of a loan and ultimately set up an appointment for a loan closing (sometimes months later)."
How much do you get for that?
$6 (that's if you're a customer service associate - financial sales consultant works a bit differently).
"The nice thing, however, is that if you refer a customer to Investments and - more..."
Mortgage.
"Worked closely with the business consultant, learned pivot tabels, v look up, managed complex calendars, approve expense reports, check requests, purchase orders"
Very unstable place of business for a trained PM.
It is difficult to put into words how much change the organization is undertaking around project management.
There are levels that are very committed to an agile form of project management while the underlying management takes an agile form of project management with a grain of salt and proceeds to move forward with the underlying management's own ideology and process.
"There is a great deal of dysfunction in the organization that would lead one to believe that it is impossible to predict how a career would go, let alone the first year of employment."
As a former military member it is easy to see from a team perspective that this is a recipe for disaster.
"And, if you cannot move ahead with positive influence it is best to remove yourself from the line of fire."
"And, that is what a former military member am doing."
"Bad location, no foot traffic."
Would have enjoyed it better if it had been busier.
I had a wonderful manager who cared about a wonderful manager who cared about his employees's employees.
Loved my customers
"Under payed, Over worked."
"Ask to do too much in too little, minimums are difficult to reach."
"Ask to service walk-ins, do follow ups for existing clients on top of making 140 calls a week."
Fun and productive work place..
Fun work place with supportive management.
Not all about the numbers
but how you personally grow and develop.
The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from my colleagues.
great place to advance and grow.
Great place to work especially if you are looking to be somewhere and grow in your career or just grow in knowledge.
The customer relationship is what makes this job most fun and rewarding.
Fun place to work but the work life balance was poor.
The culture within the store was fun and challenging.
My colleagues were all friendly and helpful.
The upper management seemed to contradict The upper management's own directives making it hard for store management to react and be as productive as store management would like.
the store was also overstocked with merchandise making it hard for customers to shop.
The quality of merchandise was very good.
The department managers were all dedicated people that were willing to help one another.
the pros and cons of banking with this bank BANK.
"Working at this bank BANK was sales driven I was always busy with clients, phone calls, and other responsibilities."
My in branch management team was a great team we all pitched in to make it a great day.
I really enjoyed the close relationships built with customers and putting a smile on customers's face.
Customer Service.
This job is a lot of customer service.
Its usually a very busy day.
The co-workers are very nice and management is very helpful.
The hardest part of This job is the miserable customers.
The most enjoyable part is your day goes by fast.
Universal Banker Position.
Workplace is easy going and fast paced.
Co-workers are very team oriented.
No room for growth or raises and bonus's are minimal.
Loved the best job place and people..
"The co-workers were the best I ever had, manager was amazing was always on time and would never leave us hanging with any job that needs any job that needs it to be done to be done, manager would always answer manager's phone even is manager was on vacation we needed to contact manager for overwritting checks over 100k."
We all became very good friends and on Fridays I used to cook to all my co-workers we either had dinner at my place or The co-workers's place.
Best people I've worked with.
Best job/career.
"Wonderful work environment, nice manangers/coworkers, good benefits for even part-time, most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help customers"
productive and fun work environment.
Very enjoyable work environment.
"Emphasis on employee development, cohesive work environment between managerial staff and all employees in every work environment."
You Are Just A Number and Customer Service is Awful.
Stressful and Low Pay.
This company has changed a lot in the last few years.
This company are getting rid of workers all of the time.
You are just a number hence why job security is one star.
One mistake and you are gone. 6 months ago i went from sitting in a room of tellers and now sit in a room of new tellers.
This company fired a woman who has worked here 30 years because of one mistake.
Took benefits away from a woman who has worked here 30 years's 6 months before retirement!
Training is a month long and worthless.
"You are told to sell to people no matter the situation, if the teller line is full of people you still have to tell a person in a hurry to leave, if a person would like a credit card"
it's B.S. and to top it off they are always under-staffed so if someone wants a credit card they have to make an appointment to see a banker a few days later!
you get 6 dollars for referrals.
They also have customer survey scores and you and the rest of the team get bonuses when you and the rest of the team scored highly BUT you need a 4.8 score out of 5 which is impossible because so many customers come in angry because This company have new people working every week and This company are always under-staffed.
"If you want to work at a bank don't work for this one especially if you're just starting out, you make 9-10 dollars an hour to be way too stressed out because of sales, making customers happy in an environment that is impossible to do so, and being worried you wont have a job tomorrow."
this bank Experience.  
this bank is a financial institution that prides this bank on achievement.
Everyone strives to ensure client short and long term goals are met.
Don't expect a big pay.
Worked there for almost 2 years with only a 30 cents raise..The manager there only cares about The manager there and not the lower employee.
Even if you work hard you won't get awarded for it.
Great flexibility.
Company is great in terms of flexibility with work from home and flex days.
Good teams and management.
"Processes established to complete tasks are somewhat cumbersome at times, and make it difficult to be successful."
Overall the people and organization care about the employees and maintaining work-life balance.
"Great place to work.. Have worked here for 3 years, find it interesting and always a challenge."
Management is great and the employee benefits are great.
"Management in the branch is awesome, but any management higher than Management in the branch are very bad..  "
this bank is one of the lowest paying banks.
this bank need to keep up with other banks and come up with a better competitive pay.
Benefits is expensive.
"Branch managers are great, Branch managers care about Branch managers's workers, but it's the Higher management who don't seem to care about the employees."
the Higher management are just looking out for the Higher management.
the Higher management just care about the numbers.
Very product pusher!
I don't like it at all.
Good team.
I like the people I work with.
the people I work with're a strong team.
Job Job itself could be better.
Don't get paid enough for the pressure you're under constantly.
greay environment.
friendly people.
I enjoyed the interaction between myself and the guests.
the guests were friendly and I had a great teller supervisor and general manager.
I would definitely recommend this position to anyone.
"Great people, declining comp/benefits."
Compensation is below industry standards in some areas.
Good benefits.
Room for advancement but frequent restructures with layoffs.
Kind of negative.
management didn't know how to realte to management's employees.
"so, employees alway felt disconnected from managers."
Pay was not the best either.
Great work-life balance & management.
"Really fantastic work life balance, management is typically very down to earth and helpful."
"People genuinely care about your success in your role, ranging from upper management to peers."
The only suggestion I would make would be to avoid this role if you are used to a traditional banking background.
"The new universal banker role is very much sales driven, and those uncomfortable with warm calling and sales quotas will not enjoy working here."
A great place to work.  
this bank has been a great place for me to work.
this bank have provided me with great job security and the people I work with in my local branch are wonderful.
Sales and service.

Good team environment.
strong customer service focus.
Easy to get answers to questions or issues you might not know how to solve.
*.
Great team to work with.
Overall work/life balance was sufficient.
Hardest was lack of support and communication at times.

"Good career opportunities, but continually changing focuses."
Great company with good career opportunities (if you are in the correct location).
The company seems to continually change focuses and it is tough to make long term plans because there are continual changes in management with new directives.

Management.
"Each region with this bank has Each region with this bank's own management, that are great at what Each region with this bank do and allow advancement for Each region with this bank's employees."
It's a bank..
It was customer service.
At a bank.
There is training and then you work.
Then re-training when the rules change.
I loved helping people.
I hated the red tape and rules designed to hinder helping people.
Motivated and professional.  
this bank required excellence in the workplace and properly trained and motivated this bank's employees to meet their employees's expectations.
Expanded my banking and loan documentation expertise.

Some Managers are uneducated in technology.
Some Managers are too dependent on technical people and very uneducated in technology.
"The managers are depending too much on the technical people and delegating too much, so The managers does whatever the technical people say."
So in reality the developers have more power than The managers.
Manage employees at a branch to make banking easier for customers.
A development program with supportive management to help you grow and develop into a manager.
Several training sessions to help teach about different aspects of banking and the different products and services that the company has to offer.
this bank Review.

there truly are not many more words to say
Fun place to work.
fun place to work
but there are to many changes to frequently.
good management.
good co workers.
good experience.
pays low.

Incentive pays are good for good quarters.
Lots of rewards and recognition.
"My manager was great, coworkers are nice and friendly, my mentor was very helpful and experiences."
"Maintain good customer service is hard, weekly customer service survey can be stressful."
Sales.
When it comes to an open friendly environment to work in this bank is definitely that.
"Advancement opportunities are not the best, due to this bank being new to the market."
Bonuses were not worth it.
One could work like crazy and not receive what their worth.
Downtown Pittsburgh.  
this bank is a huge operation.
this bank's section with Global Investment Services managed mutual funds which specifically involved preparing Form 1120-RICs and footnote disclosures for Our section with Global Investment Services's annual reports.
"this bank decided to open a global investment service section in Downtown Pittsburgh in 2008, but then decided to close a global investment service section in Pittsburgh in 2009 this bank told this bank that these jobs which were mostly based on the East Coast (Philadelphia and Boston) were ideal for Downtown Pittsburgh, but this bank abruptly had a change of heart and let go this bank's entire floor, roughly 100 workers Regulated investment companies was an short stop during my 25 years of work experience."
"It wasn't a bad position, but the daily commute to Downtown Pittsburgh was typically a 3 hour time period each day, both ways."
The parking and food was quite expensive and the traffic/construction/accidents/weather/special events did present some challenges along the way.
My manager was among my all-time favorites and my co-workers were very smart and devoted to our responsibilities.
I was a Data Entry Clerk and process payments..
I enjoyed this fast-paced position as a data entry clerk.
this fast-paced position as a data entry clerk was exciting with the high volume of receivables to process on daily basis.
"Productive, fun, and warm environment."
"Imagine fun and working at the same time.....impossible, right?"
this bank Eastwick center was great.
"On site lunchroom (not free), on site daycare for emergencies (pretty sure it wasn't free), free parking in a huge lot, near the airport, near 95 and major roads, shuttle picks up employees and takes employees to the nearby train (free), etc."

I enjoy assisting customer with customer's banking needs.
productive fun place..
great place to work.
Hours are horrible.
great team.
GREAT manager.

coworkers are friendly.
Hardest part about the job is the horrible hours.
Great place to get experience.
"Overall, I enjoyed my experience very my in this bank's investment department."
My direct manager was easily the best in my career.
"Upper management doesn't seem to value advisors, considering advisors as replaceable cogs."
It was okay.
"ona regular day you would be answering phone calls concerning this bank account holders about overdraft refunds, balances, online banking or any other type of banking question."
I've learned a lot about everyday banking and step to prevent an overdraft from occuring.
"The co workers are amazing and are the most help when it comes to questions, whereas I found it very difficult to find a manager to answer questions or take an escalated phone call."
"But it pays very well and the hours are decent, plus you have every holiday off."
The only downside is you have to be okay with hear customers cry or yell on the phone while still denying customers's request but if you can get over that your perfect.
"High turnover, questionable practices."
"In 2014 this bank hired 700 new employees, within 12 months 600 of 700 new employees were gone."
"Experienced many questionable practices, particularly with Quality scoring, which I saw as Quality scoring, which I saw as their was as knocking down the bonus one qualified for's was as knocking down the bonus one qualified for."
"Coaches are young and over the top arrogant, not in the least bit constructive, if anything, Coaches drove down moral; management seemed to have management's back all the way, no matter what."
"The supervisor I worked under was noticeably insecure and gravitated to the brown nosers, leadership skills were very almost no existent."
"Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) were welcomed because Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) gave a moment of relief from being on the phones, sadly Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) became as daunting as being on the phones because all Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) were about was applauding for the top performers followed up by a pressure to raise the bar."
"In order to drive you, you're scores would be posted for everyone to see where you stood in the pecking order."
There were lot's of contests to help drive you and ongoing pot lucks.
"Be prepared to donate, donate, donate."
"And if you're not the type to run around to be 'In a click', then you were going to be seen as an outsider."
"Overall this bank struck me as a very paranoid and oppressive organization, top-down."
"I'm all for hard work, but not having the life sucked out of me."
"Productive, Fun, Friendly."
I answered questions/concerns about bank accounts.
"mailed out lost, stolen, and damaged bank cards."

Everyone there was very welcoming and friendly
this bank.
"Love my branch manager and regional manager, because this is a small market its not any room for growth."
my branch manager and regional manager definitely expect way too much and do not like to give to employees.
a lot of unprofessional people.

Very productive and busy.
"uplifting work place with associates, sometimes work could be overly intense."
"Over all great leadership ideas, great medical benefits an 401k."
I enjoyed the people I worked with but that's mostly it..
The compensation is far below the norm for the same positions at competing companies.
The employee turnover is very fast and The employee turnover's quite impersonal.
Even the interview was conducted as a group interview.
Professional work environment.  
this bank is an extraordinary company to work for.
There are plenty of opportunities for promotion and you are always learning.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my co-workers and learning from my co-workers.
There was always something new to learn.

• Manage all aspects and responsibilities of the customer service staff in a call center environment for a team of 30 – 50 representatives.
Too Big to Connect.
At this bank it can be hard to connect the large mission of the organization with the front lines.
"this bank says a lot about finding, developing, and retaining good talent, but the bottom line is that this bank don't put this bank's money and resources where this bank's talk is."
"Lately, this bank has been all about cutting expenses and growing revenue."
"While I completely understand why cutting expenses and growing is important for any business, the extremes that this bank has taken have limited the ability of this bank's employees and managers to connect and grow."
"Instead, this bank've cut employee benefits, salaries for internal candidates are not competitive, and stress on the individual contributor and local managers is through the roof."
"The first and second level managers care and want to help grow the individual employees, but The first and second level managers are limited by bureaucracy and red tape."
"this bank is the largest company I've worked for, so my comparative experience is limited."
"I have given this bank the benefit of doubt for so long, but I do feel this bank could do much better."
Fun job but little room for advancement.
I enjoy my position with the company on a daily basis.
The problem that I am having is advancement within my current department.
There just aren't positions available and the ladder is very short.
"However, I would definitely recommend this position to young outgoing sales personalities as a great position."
Great corporation to work for.. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers.
There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
The hardest part of my job was the extensive amount of changes everyday.
"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a large corporation."

Good Culture and people.
Greeat Company to work for and opportunity for advancement.
Plenty of different roles within the bank industry to find something enjoyable .
Not the best place to work not the worst.
Seemingly very little room for advancement.
Genuinely good candidates are overlooked and more work is created than necessary by having to train new hires from zero background instead of pulling people currently working at company
Sales driven and customer friendly.

Customer Service Representative.
"Fast paced environment, constantly learning new functions and supports various product groups to help service the customer in a timely manner."
Primarily responsible for servicing corporate clients and business clients that have Treasury Management products.
The management team is very supportive and provides a monthly review of your job performance.
Co-workers are great and really live up to the word team player.
"The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the influx of calls that 'roll over' to the department, but self-rewarding when you take ownership of the call to service the customer."

"Overall, Treasury Management is growing and offers a lot to Treasury Management's employees."
Great co workers.
The best part of my day was my co workers my co workers were very supportive with helping me at the beginning.
The branch I was working in needs a whole new team of management.

Weren't professional with the staff.
Threatens your job every chance a whole new team of management got very miserable people a whole new team of management are.

Work 9 hours only get a half hour break but the managers work 9 hours the managers get 45 minutes.

Customer sales and service.
Enhanced my skills of handling diverse people.
Very interesting place to work.
My co workers are very nice.
"Even though I like working here, there is not many opportunities for advancement in the area of my study."
Employees best interest is on the bottom of Employees's list.
All Employees care about are the #'s.
Management only looks out for Management.
All Management care about are the numbers and hitting the insights button to ensure we're having the this bank conversation with every client.
Management set unrealistic expectations for workers.
"There will only be 2 or 3 tellers on a busy day and have the line out the door, and expect you to still try and sell a credit card to someone who is frustrated for waiting in line for almost 20 minutes."
Extremely frustrating!!!
"Management're now beginning to push out people who make an average salary of $30,000 a year to give people who make an average salary of $30,000 a year's position to someone who is younger and will do their position for less."
Where is the loyalty behind that!!!

"Good company, great benefits."
Banking isn't what Banking used to be.
Spent a lot of time this last year with not much to do but wait for customers to come in.
"this bank has a great online and mobile experience, if I didn't work there I would never go to a bank again!"
Customers love doing banking without the need for a teller which explains the lack of customers.
No review.
"I have not worked at this bank Merchant Services in a number of years, so it would not be appropriate for me to offer a review."
I do know that many sales representatives who were there at the same time I worked there have moved on to other employment.
Fun atmosphere.
"Customers become like family, however pay is low.."
Not much opportunity to advance with a company who promotes from the outside
but I love being a banker.
the customers are the greatest.
Great place to start career in banking..  
this bank has a great work culture and this bank is great for a person who is beginning there career in banking.
The ability to advance is great and this bank are willing to train you so you can grow.
The only con is the compensation and working weekends.
Productive workplace.
It was a great place for me to gain many of the customer service skills I still use today.
The culture feels like family and there is ample opportunity to grow and expand your future due to the company's size.
What I learned.  
this bank does not work well at all with students.
Do not like when students need different availability during fall even though you are part time.
"students are nice people when you say yes to everything, but once students see that you are busy and cannot say yes, students change."
I enjoyed my interaction with my customers and working with colleagues that made this bank a fun place to work..  
"this bank offered great Employee Benefits which included 401K ; incentives, insurance options."
this bank was a fast paced environment with high goal and compliance expectations.
"this bank however, has a high employee turn around which made it challenging to have a Job Work and Life balance."
Have a plan if you are going to work here.
"For technical positions it has been my experience that this bank is great at allowing time to work from home, and having a work balance that generally allows people to stick to a 40 hour work week."
"This does come at the cost of nearly non-existent opportunities for advancement within this bank, extremely antiquated technology, and highly dogmatic practices that requires a board of upper level managers to review and approval any code change (including 1-line code changes)."
For these reasons it appears the best employees for this culture are people looking for a secure opportunity that will last people looking for a secure opportunity that will last them until retirement until retirement.
"Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here must take it upon Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here to ensure Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here are working on the right type and quantity of projects, and right types of technology, to keep Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here's skills marketable in this antiquated and highly bureaucratic system."
Branch Manager.
You know when you are viewing 5 different reports in order to make another report things are getting out of hand.
"Not enough time to deal with customers and employees because of all the busy work, redundant reporting and endless conference calls and meetings."
Focus on the important things and leave the busy work behind.
Too many layers of management trying to justify Too many layers of management's positions by creating more reports to do.

Working with my peers.
I enjoy working with my peers that make my day delightful and willing to help others on a daily basis is the reason why I enjoy my job everyday.
"this bank is a good place to work for but, lacks advancement.."
"If you have a poor manager it will be difficult to build your skills, advance, and it can be difficult at time to work with other individuals."
Work.
Your day can go from dull to busy in the blink of an eye.
With time you learn what days are going to be busy and hopefully things can be adjusted.
Customers can be demanding but I have learned that there are three types.
The first is the accepting of Customers's mistakes and are just looking for explanation as to why.
When you fix Customers's problem are great full.
There's the it's your fault and nothing you can do makes Customers happy.
Then there's the what can you do for me.
"Employees, including management have become a culture of watching out for number one at whatever cost."
Lately this bank has become a company that see's you as the amount of widgets you bring in not an individual no matter how hard you work

Being a positive person is key in making my work environment enjoyable.

Very mentally draining.
Moved my way up through the ranks the first twelve years.
Total of fifteen year time span from drive through window teller to my last position as Senior Loan Support Specialist.
Very fast paced and often times not enough help with work load.
They expected you at times to carry the work load of five people and get the work done in a short time frame and be accurate.

The only time I have moved up in grade is when I left the department I worked in.
I now have 2 degrees (one in a Business field) and am becomingly more frustrated with the opportunities that I have been seeing.
I wish there was a development program for internal employees.

Needs to have a more standardized methodology to launching company priorities Good opportunity to get exposed to different lines of business.
True belief system in providing a sense of financial well being to it's customers Look for opportunities to increase penetration rate for investment clients within bank's book and outside of book.
"Micro management , very poor training , nice offices , very clicky, in underwriting not one manager / team does anything the same or any of the center."
Very poor training~I was a temporary senior underwriter employee hired in to help with the back flow of underwriting !
Everything I was told by the recruiter was not true/ or correct!
It was somewhat of a BATE and SWITCH technique!
Travel was a cluster mess - hotels were supposed to be paid for when we checked in ~ hotels were not we had to pay for two weeks of a hotel stay and get reimbursed - which recruiter and manager said it would ALL be paid for!
MICRO management is not the word ( and I was a remote employee!
My manager was a very pushy rushing person who did not take any time to explain anything - just thought that the one week in impact traing (system) would be enough - which would be if it was properly done!
My former manager cannot keep an in office employee at all My former manager has lost three employees in three weeks ( I was told ) and one girl left bc manager told one girl one girl got up out of one girl's seat too much ( mind you one girl was using bathroom and getting water and making phone calls on breaks to one girl's newborn daughter who was being watched ) and yet one girl was hitting one girl's numbers and completing all work at a timely manner!
Not one of the managers or teams or operation centers do anything the same - others rec'd better training depending what team you were on!
Worst
bank i have ever worked for !
i've been underwriting for over ten years and in the mortgage banking business for 19 years !
i was treated like a child im 40 years old !!!
Pay was ok -
but they hired temp employees at same skill level and paid everyone different wages people sitting in the office are making almost 9$ less than - more...
Teller.
Love the job and the people that work with me.
The only thing I didn't like about the job was the pay.
Everyone got along and the job was a great place to work.
A typical quibicle job.
"Mostly about numbers, not so much of the persona treatment at work."
Management is good to work with.
Benefits are worse than before; cut in insurance plans.
Not many if at all opportunities to advance
Great Company.  
this bank is a great company at which to be an employee.
My only complaint is that the extremely risk-averse policies can sometimes be a barrier to making progress.
Very Deceptive Company.
Be wary about starting a career with this company!
I was an employee for two years.
Started as a CSA which turned into a Universal Branch Consultant.
The amount of work that is put on you is nothing less than stressful to the point of needing a psychologist.
"There are before hours conference calls, and mandatory after hours cold calling."
You are NOT in the best interest of the customer.
"You are stressed because of CIQ (Customers rating of how well you kissed their butt), and managerial lack of engagement."
"When I asked for a raise to the Regional Manger (due to all the responsibilty I had taken on in the past year), I was told...'I guess this company should have negotiated better when this company started, huh?'"
That was the true this bank coming out...
A few months later I was discharged for no reason at all.
"this bank seriously are out for profit, not to help customers financially."
"this bank left a family that day with no income, but much better off now!"
horrible company.
the whole company was awful from the first day I started I started looking for another job.
I hated all of it.
only 2 people were nice.
and the customers were terrible manager was a troll.
hardest part of my job.
"Smiling best part, locking the door and leaving."
Community Culture.  
this bank is about work life and home life balance.
this bank are a 'pay it forward' kind of company and are an active supporter of the United Way.
"this bank are one of the top companies to work for, for women as well."
Consistent and Customer Friendly.  
this bank generally is all about 5 star service to this bank's clients and maintaining brand consistency within the this bank footprint.
"A typical day for me would be operating as a Teller, Personal Banker and Staff Support."
I have to wear many hats as a Customer Service Associate.
Managements job primarily is to make sure that all goals are met regarding sales & customer service scores.
In addition to ensuring that policy and procedures are being followed at all times.
Everything is very team oriented with regards to both wins and losses as a branch.
"Therefore, a morning huddle is done each day to ensure that the branch team is on the same page."
I have learned how to seriously multitask and continuously learn how to prioritize according to urgency.
Some challenges may have included dealing with needy or disgruntled customers on occasions.
"Nevertheless, when I see that someone has truly been blessed by my services that definitely puts a smile on my face."
At the end of the day if me doing my job made someone else's life better that is a great reward.
Good experience.
Position provides great investment experience and plenty of networking opportunities.
Management seems to be in constant cost cutting mode and are just now trying to build company culture.
"Great work environment, love the customers and my co workers."
Everyday is different.
"I go to work assist customers, talk to customers as if customers are my family."
customers ask about my family and I ask about theirs.
"Every week I am in charge of balancing the ATM, as well as every month I order the branch supplies."
"I love my co-workers, my co workers are my other family."
There really is not a hard part about my job.
The most enjoyable part about my job is seeing my customers and getting to know my customers on a personal level.
My job is located in a small town so everyone sticks together.
Great place to work.
"Answer phones, count vault, have meetings about getting non customers to open accounts, different scenarios to better customer service"
Good Place to work.  
this bank has a good work/life balance and decent benefits.
Good place to start in the financial world too with the ability to move up
exciting work place.
good communication by management and team between bar and restaurant as well.
Had bands on the weekends and made for a very exciting work day and night.
little room to grow.
"I worked for this bank for many years and through the years, I could see that the culture was changing as this bank was growing."
The focus was more on sales and less on employee engagement.
"To me, it is important to work for a company who values their employees just as much as their revenue because we are the frontline individuals who are helping this bank grow and prosper through our every day interactions with clients."
a really solid bank to work for.

Productive atmoshphere and fun.  
"this bank bought and sold mortgages, for the most part my job was approving easements for the city, if work needed to be done by the city I had to make sure there was enough equity in the home before allowing this."
My co-workers all had other jobs
so I didn't get to interact a lot but all were very nice.
There was so much to this position I didn't get the chance to learn the hard vs good.
I left there to work for Abbott.
Many changes from day to day.
"A good place to work, but much turnover in the WM department."
There also was much confusion since the bank N merge had just occurred.
I believe it was a bad timing when I started there and a reason for this lack luster review.
Management is uncertian of what Management are doing.
"Upper Management is uncertain of what Upper Management are doing, massive changes and overspending lead to hiring / pay freezes."
"The potential for movement used to exist, no longer much of a possibility"
Productive and learning ground..
Always a good day start.
New technology.
Timely management.
Work culture is Friendly.
"Non, as long as you love your work."
The challenges
Solid company with a good foundation..
Clear guidelines and ample opportunity for growth.
Worked in the north east region.
Good bonus structure.
Plenty of other incentives as well.
Fast paced with many changes often daily.
Leads the teller line daily with cash management and sales referrals.
The teller supervisor work hand in hand with the branch manager on a daily basis.

Great Company.
I have 21 experience with this bank and this bank's a great company to work for.
I've been in serval different departments throughout my career with this bank
N/a. •

Also responsible for sales of new or improved products that this bank offers.
Adustment clerk.
"Audit and research and correction of individual, corporate and federal reserve checks."
Internal and external customer relations.
Productive.
"My typical day was taking care customers, working closely with my co-workers."
Going outside the branch to get new relationships.
Excellent Place to work.  
this bank is an excellent employer.
The management is style is exceptional.
I'm provided with everything I needed in the high energy Loan Modification department.
Gradifing.
I loved all my customers I got a chance to meet and get to know some great people.
It allowed me to not only make great friends but help great friends organize the finances.
I worked with a great bunch of people I miss taco Tues.
Really care about the children in our communities.
"I regret it did not work out, but I moved into a wrong position and could not return to what I was best suited for."
"I wanted to return to Branch Management and did apply, but for not the right areas."
interactive and productive.
Engaging with my customers and meeting my customers's needs is the best part of my job.
I learn something new every day at my job.
Knowing that others trust me with others's financial well being gave me a great pleasure to continue to do the best at work everyday.
Poor Management.  
this bank has the best processing system in the industry however management is horrible.
The pay is decent but if you like being micro managed this bank is the place to go.
Great work-life balance.
Generally stress-free work environment but compensation is below market.
"There is not too much emphasis on higher education, the CFA exams are not reimbursed."
"Great place to work, as if family.."
"Very happy working there, easy going staff and environment."
Hope to find a place like that again.
"Forward- thinking, team driven, focused on customer service, add value and excellence."
a great place to work.
I enjoyed working a this bank Mortgage very much.
this bank Mortgage are very employee orientated.
this bank Mortgage were very supportive and helpful when a problem arose while working my processess.
If I had a question this bank Mortgage were very helpful in getting me an answer
this bank.
A great place to work.
this bank are family oriented and understand your life needs.
I have learned so much working here and continue to learn.
Good at Job Work/LIfe Balance Poor on Compensation.
How I was told the job would be when hired vs. how the job is today 2 years later is totally different.
The level of undue stress due to lack of upper management direction tends to overshadow the benefits of work/life balance.
Then when you find out that you are 20k under paid vs. the industry average it is really hard to find a motivation to stay.
Not a great company to work for.. -
"At this bank, the training was really bad."
The content of the CSR's and Branch employees is almost nonexistent - PPO medical insurance is all that is offered - Schedule SUCKS!!!
You never get 2 days off in a row.
That's tiring after a while The employee assessments were pretty much made up of weekly call scoring.
The process is not consistent and was just a horrible process this bank thinks pretending to be nice on the phone is a good way to cover up our lack of knowledge.
"I am a type of person that loves to help people when I can, this bank's policies and lack to content training makes it almost impossible to give great customer service."
"this bank rant on and on about confidence on calls, confidence to this bank is making stuff up on the phone to sound like truth."
I've had coaches tell me to get better at making stuff
up
I HATED working there.
I left before a year because I couldn't stomach working for such an incompetent corporation.
I've worked at Bank of America before and LOVED Bank of America.
"If you want to work for a bank, choose another one to apply to."
Be warned.
"There are a lot of middle (little) men at this bank Poor training, hours, benefits, and customer services."
Period!
A good stepping stone job.
This job taught me a lot about the industry and how to work with people regarding personal finances.
The job expectations are clear and the company provides recognition for hard work and accomplishments.
My professional opinion- this bank cares about credibility.  
"this bank Rewards Performance, should make stock holders happy."
Upholds a professional culture.
I enjoy being able to serve as a contribution.
Upper management encourages employee feedback.
this bank strives thru change.
My favorite part about working for this bank is by far the leadership examples.
"And it is by example, that one earns credibility."
productive place to work.
have learned to multitask in different situaions.
learning to manage more employees.
typical day at work involes handling cash desposits and withdraws.
"ordering cash for the banch, sending out cash to our back office,"
Loves to Hire Within!.
"I have been with this bank for almost 4 years, and I have been promoted two different times since being hired."
"this bank recognizes great work ethic, relationship builders, and someone who really believes in the mission of this bank."
"Being in a Management position currently, I would say the hardest part of my job is when other branches need help and this bank have to send an employee to other branches's branch for the day."
This creates inconsistency and this bank lose an employee's engagement by sending an employee all over the place.
The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers every day and helping my employees develop and grow within this bank.
Day in the Life.
A typical day as a Senior Manager consists of a jam-packed day of multiple meeting usually being double booked.
"As one matures in their career, he can determine importance."
A typical day for me was attending multiple meeting but more important addressing the needs of the companies most important asset.....people.
Great Company.
This company was great to work for.
This company are a company that follows everything by the book.
If you stay with This company you will grow with This company.
Company has gone down.
The company was ok in the beginning.
All of the old regional managers were told All of the old regional managers were no longer needed and new regionals came in and The company started going down.
"Very sales driven and you can be terminated in 2 months, The Human Resources department is terrible."
Not concerned about employees
The life of finance.
Going to work everyday was a joy for me.
"Not only did I love what I did, but I loved being able to help others and not just myself on a daily basis."
The hardest part of my job would of have to be that sometimes you have to accept the fact that you cannot help everybody.
Sometimes there that fact things out of your control in life and you just have to accept that fact.
"The most enjoyable part of my job working as a customer service representative was that when I was able to help others I was not only helping others, but I was supporting others decisions and making sure that others knew that when something went wrong that I was there to help others the best that I could."
"Also, I loved working there because you could help people plan for people's futures."
Far and wide.
You could help people.
Even around the world.
"You will never see people or talk to people again after that call ends, but in the end you knew that you helped people the best that you could."
Thank you.
fast paced high sctress sales environment.
its a good company to work for comes with its share of challenges sales goasl can be high but the financial rewards are great if you can deal with the pressure.
"Lacked Structure, and training."
Training was very confusing and frustrating.
Company only concerned about Company's profit.
Underwriting center not efficient.
Heavy employee turn-over.
Bank Job.
Working at a bank was a different experience for mine.
mine learned a lot and was excited to grow in the company.
mine had a great Supervisor who was so patient and willing to teach and a great co-worker who became a good friend of mine!
Fun workplace with lot of training to keep you updated.
"A typical day at work involves planning sales activities, assisting customers with account opening, holding in-depth conversation with customers to identify customers's financial needs and completing Teller transactions."
That aspect of in-depth conversation with customers and valuing customers's business is something worthy of mentioning.
Customers are always top priority.
"Typically, getting promoted takes longer period, averagely 4 years."
Benefit/compensation program is not the best in the industry.
Colleagues and management are friendly and fun to work with.
"If you're a starter in banking, then I recommend."
"But if you're looking at better compensation and quick promotions, then you're are looking in the wrong direction."
There's high attrition rate probably due to compensation and other factors earlier mentioned.
"But overall, I think it's fun place to start a career."
decent place to work.
"decent place to work, pay is lower than competitor financial institutions, working Saturdays were acceptable until working Saturdays went to extended hours"
"Poor Pay, High Work Load with Little Bonus."
"Sales goals for branches are the same across the board no matter if you work for a small branch in the middle of nowhere or a branch on campus, goals are still the same."
Very difficult to advance.
Structure of the company is changing to where everyone at branch level will have to do everything without getting paid adequately.
"I researched my pay based on the skills I have and I am getting paid $10,000 LESS than the average."
Good Company.
"Great company to work for, but the pay is horrible for what all you need to do."
There is not much room for advancement.
People in upper positions stay forever.
Efficiently run company.
"Quality management, good benefits, caring professionals, desire for success."
Challenges related to compliance and proven production.
this bank (customer service rep).
"there requirements are not realistic, i didn't mind talking to customers however every called is critiqued and they always pic short calls to review which aren't fair enough bc"
your not always able to hit your points.
They want you to talk to customers like you literately know customers and at the same time think about your time.
And most customers like to tell you most customers's life story lol.
I believe they need to change some other requirements.
"Because too many people loose too many people's jobs from this issue, or too many people are quitting bc of the stress of this issue."
Productive workplace.
Coming in and doing all the safety procediures before opening the bank.
Making sure I have enough money to start my day.
Greeting customers as customers enter and making sure customers's needs are met.
"Great people to work with, caring environment.."
"I loved working at this bank, management was awesome and I had coworkers that would assist me as needed."
It was nice working with a group of people that wanted to see you succeed.
Same for all.
I only worked for a year and half at the company and I worked part time.
My co-workers were friendly and easy to work with.
I did not receive many benefits working part time.
Stressful job for low wages.
Lots of rules and regulations.
Constantly being watched by management.
Great opportunities to help people better manage people's money
Knowledgeable Workplace.

this bank.  
this bank has been a good company to work for.
I have been with this bank for 6 months and I don't have many complaints.
"The few complaints i do have are hours, and management."
Fun place to work.
Enjoy working at this bank.
Great place to lean and great co-worker.
Retail environment lots of selling and customer service
this bank Review.
"My experience at this bank was a great one I learned a lot from management team and upper management, Developed close knit freidn"
Financial Sales Counsultant.
Great company that is should never be bought out.
If anything this bank will probably acquire more banks in the future.
That gives every employee a nice sense of relief for job security.
Unsatisfactory workplace with little room for advancement.
"With this bank's's ever-changing policy changes, it became nearly impossible to truly feel secure in the direction this bank's was headed or in any advancement opportunities The pay is dismal, particularly for the amount of work done and the expectations placed upon the tellers."
Productive.
Sales associate main focus on obtaining new accounts and meting sales goals.
Poor management on all levels of the company.
Looked for better opportunities
Very settle and work/life balance was very good..
The company did care about The company's employees opinions through Employees Engagement Surveys that come out twice a year.
The company could much better in paying The company's employees.
"In fact, the turnover was very high and at some points I was working just by myself for six months."
Great place to work.
loved working at this bank.
"Would still be there, but my husband moved us out of town."
Learn a lot about computers there.
The management was terrific.
Great branch team and overall great company.
I'm part of the management team.
Typical day includes assisting customers.
"Many branches and opportunities in Kalamazoo, MI"
Customer Core.
My typical day at work consists of answering phones and assisting customers with any questions that customers have in regards to banking.
corporate doesn't care.
Corporate and regional managers only care about Corporate and regional managers's pockets and have no feelings for anyone doing the actual work.
Corporate and regional managers pressure everyone to meet high numbers that are unrealistic and then fire people because Corporate and regional managers want less people to do more work
"fast paced, , challenging."
"had to receive 5 star rating in customer service, got to know a lot of customers, great co-workers had to make sure drawers and vault balance"
this bank was a great place to work.
"On a typical day at work I would complete the customer's transactions, pull my daily reports, help with other area's in this bank."
"I also order the branch supplies, such a the cash and other materials that they need to make their job easier."
I would coach my tellers and other team members.
I enjoyed what I do because I love my customers and it makes me feel great every week when our report comes out and it show's how much my customers greatly appreciate me and the service that I give to my customers.
corporate minded.
"There were busy times, and down times, but always something to do."
"I learned a lot about laws, and regulations."
The branch based management I had were all very good.
I am still close with my coworkers I started my career with.
I enjoyed helping my customers the most.
Good hours.
"My day is always busy,I do a number of things thorughout my day."
I came in as a Teller and within 4 months I am doing the Teller Supervisor position.
I deal with a variety a customers some good and some bad.
Great.
Great company to work for.
The work life balance is great.
The pay could be higher though.
There are a lot of opportunities to learn different skills.
Fun.
"Bankers job i Liked it, Helping Customers out was my favorite putting a smile on Customers's face, getting Customers approved for a new loan or a new mortgage."
Run!!!.
This bank is focused only on making and saving money no matter how many customer's or employees are screwed over in the process.
"This bank claim This bank care about being green, employees, and customers but it is all a lie."
This bank is moving toward branches operated by two people with no teller lines to save on payroll.
If you want to cash a check a person will walk you to an ATM that is able to cash a check for you if you have a This bank account.
No face to face human interaction other that the wall the bank of ATM's along the wall where a teller line used to exist.
You can only sit with someone if you are interested in purchasing another This bank product.
"This bank is a joke, if you're thinking of applying, don't."

the organization doesn't foster upward mobility ..
Few very qualified people are recognized.
Few very qualified people talk a good game until you really want to move up Unless you know someone up high you won't have a chance.
Diversity is only a phrase Few very qualified people use.
the reality is diversity doesn't exist in the Executive Suite.
Ok place to work.
"not much advancement, great co-workers, sometimes fun environment, ok pay, family atmosphere, pretty good working hours"
this bank is a good place to work..  
this bank is a good place to work.
this bank treat this bank's employees well and give their employees several benefits throughout the year.
Unfortunately the raises and advancement opportunities are not very good.

A typical day at work.
I work almost everyday of the week except for sundays.
"Every morning when we open the doors, the same business customers come in and we talk about how business is going."
"I take deposits, and do withdrawals, and make sure all of the transactions are processed during the day."
Company is very forward thinking..
Second to none in technology.
"Very advanced in migration in using self-serving behaviors, therefore preparing me for the future of banking."
Poor management.
I really enjoy working with the public.
Management did not carry the title well.
Relationships with certain employees were more personal than professional.
Great Place to work.

Love my fellow employees.

"The this bank , Inc.'s values show the commitment that The this bank , Inc. have to The this bank , Inc.'s employees."
"There are growth opportunities, excellent benefits, a strong commitment to work/life balance."
Great Associates.
"Great Associates has an urban and new way of banking, but lacks some advancement in products."
Job security is always a threat which isn't a great thing to face on a daily basis.
Toss Up.
"Dependant upon the department or section an employee works for determines the work life balance, compensation, job security, management, and job culture because some are better than others."
A decent company.
"A good company, needs more structure and better management training."
Location plays a major factor in quarterly targets.
Good vacation and sick day benefits.
Great Place to work.
I loved working for this bank.
this bank is very progressive and encourages the personal growth of each of this bank's employees.
"Great training, great people work here."
This company has 5 star star training for This company's employees.
"This company offer lots to enures This company know what everyone is doing and This company offer advancement The pay stinks , its so low -you can support anyone on this salary."
"Which is ironic because This company're all about quality of life, but This company don't This company're people at all."
Only if your a district executive - even managers aren't paid that well.
this bank Investments.
"Fast paced, large sales goals, fun environment, opportunity to advance, enjoyable co-workers, nice benefits, competitive salary."
It's a great place to work.
"Loved working at this bank, this bank are very family and community oriented."
Loved the work from home policy twice a month.
Co-workers are there for each other when needed.
The hardest part of the job was trying to learn more when no one wanted to show you.
Working there was very enjoyable and you learn a lot once you get someone willing to show you new things.
"Productive, fast paced."
"typical day consists of lobby management,engaging people in the aisles of the supermarket, providing customers with the knowledge about different products and services"
Almost 10 Years.  
this bank was a wonderful place to work.
Company downsizing is understandable when foreclosure is at a low.
I simply wish I was able to continue my career at this bank.
I was laid off a few months shy of my 10 year anniversary.
Loved the customers.
"A friendly relaxed work environment, however leadership was lacking Co-workers were phenomenal and everyone pulled together consistently to achieve branch goals."
"Great job, little advancement opportunities, lousy benefits."
"Pay is fantastic, ability to work from home, good work load."
Little to no advancement opportunities.
"Such a big and profitable company should offer better benefits, better benefits are a High Deductible plan and better benefits is very high."
Individual Branches Cave in Performance Under Corporate Demands.
Management is not chosen wisely.
Employees are constantly receiving mixed messages.
Customers are hard to come by considering all the competition.
The banker role is good for someone who is very driven.
Its okay place to work.
Expectations are too high.
Many turn overs and change is constants.
Manager is okay.
Co-workers are fine but its always new people.
Sales sales.
Sales was the main focus and performance determines how big the bonus is.
Scheduling your shift was a plus.
A longer Lunch would make performance better and setting attainable performance goals would also be a plus.
this bank is currently growing and changing the way of doing things new.
I would highly recommend someone new to this bank great!
for starters good management team this bank have deadline on a daily basis this bank have huddles to make day go smoothly the hardest is being one team one shop one goal sometimes
productive and organized company to work for.
Great company to work for.
"xtremely organized, love working for the company."
family oriented company.
Great location from where i reside.
love people that work there
Great Staff.  
this bank has a great staff to work with.
a great staff to work with work hard together as a teamn and help each with the branch goals.
I enjoy the moring meets and the wards and recongion.
Teller.
The typical day would be just like at any bank.
Since i have already answered i am not exactly sure what else i need to say.
It was great working here
but i guess it depends on your team and manager.
Not helpful to men with ill wives.
"Co-workers were okay to work with, managers (depending if you're in the inner circle), will take up for you...hardest part of the position was keeping up with all of the new laws and regulations that the government sends down the pipeline, however the work was fairly easy."
My wife was ill and I had occurrences rack up for the position (no FMLA).
"They let me go the day before our wedding anniversary, and when I tried to challenge the termination, they came up with a day I was late due to our car doors being frozen No job security whatsoever, although I was being molded for team lead position and had received district and headquarter praise for the lowest handle time in the call center."
Great.
"Geat work environment, management and co workers."
I learned a lot about the value of your customers.
I had a great work life balance.
work place.
always tense and very micro managed.
Very stressful work environment the breaks and lunches were very short.
The most enjoyable part of the job was I had good coworkers and a good help team
A good place to work.
They say they're a family oriented company but during hard family times they don't show compassion to situations such as death.
This is a very fast paced job and they are very short staffed.
Someone is constantly getting fired and they have no problem replacing you.
The compensation for your work is minimal.
There is no sales training for a job that strongly focuses on sales.
Management was lazy and ill prepared to handle tasks.
Not the job it's presented to be!!.
"Similar to another review I saw on here, the job I was hired for and the job I performed were two completely different things."
Banking is moving in general to a universal banker format where everyone in the branches are required to do everything.
Branches are forced to make a ridiculous amount of cold calling to try to drive in appointment traffic to sell products to customers.
My particular branch was constantly short staffed.
I was forced to work overtime for weeks on end.
My manager would also show up and leave whenever My manager wanted claiming to be out on 'business calls' from which our team never seemed to see any business.
I was trained for platform banking and was never allowed to do anything with platform banking.
Times when we would be short a banker for a random reason they would want to throw me on having no real training.
There is no real room for growth either which was very upsetting.
"Regardless of whether I tried to go the banker path or the teller supervisor path, I was shut down and faced with obstacles."
I was also made to cover the teller supervisor position for a few months and given no additional compensation or opportunity for advancement.
Maybe if you are a young kid and want a decent job while living at home this could be a good opportunity for you.
"However, the salary does not make it possible for you to live as an independent adult."
I will say that I did have two of the greatest co-workers I have ever had the pleasure to work with.
two of the greatest co-workers I have ever had the pleasure to work with are the only part of the job I miss.
Most of the IT employees are over-loaded.
"Too much work, too much overtime."
The company culture has changed in the past two years.
Most people can't balance work and family.
Favorite place I've worked.
There is no other place in the history of ALL my jobs that I enjoyed as much as this bank.
I got along with everyone and was trained well.
"this bank wouldn't accept failure, and that's awesome!"
this bank also treated this bank's customers well.
Value Driven Organization.  
this bank strives to bring value to customers through a thought out training process to give staff members to opportunities to show case staff members's value creation during customer interactions.

Enjoy working with a great Team.
Having the ability to train other onboarding employees.
Great way to interact with customers.
A great customer service job but not much room for advancement.
A great way to get your foot in the door with the company.
A great job that requires you to be detail oriented.
Productive workplace.
"Although the organization maybe a tad bit unorthodox, the organization is overall a great opportunity for those who are just starting those who are just starting their career in sales's career in sales."
Washington Mutual was bought out by JP Morgan Chase.
A typical day work at Washington Mutual was reviewing files and submitting to quality for approval.
The only thing that I did not like about this process is there was not good communication between loss mit and quality.
Family feeling again with co-workers and bosses.
This job was a very long time ago.
It was Valley American Bank back then and Darr Weikamp was the owner of Valley American Bank.
I worked at the main office and loved working with all the officers of Valley American Bank and got to know most of all the officers of the bank.
I worked the Drive Thru there so it was very fast pace which I really liked.
I was prime time
so I was locked into 19 hrs.
a wk.
Perfect for me at the time.
Hardest part was watching for fraud.
Wonderful Bank to work for however not many opportunities for Human Resources Professional left in this area.
I would have had to relocate..
I built my professional career at this bank.
It was an opportunity that I will always be grateful for.
I had the experience to manage multiple teams throughout PA and NJ and welcomed the challenges that provided me.
I built my foundation of knowledge there and continue to build on everything taught to me.
Great company.
Understanding of work and home life.
Treats employees very fairly.
Good benefits.
Excellent retirement benefits.
Good vacation options.
Lots of opportunity to grow within the company.

"Nice community bank, great hours, okay incentives."
Great for advancement.
Hours are great.
Job is fairly easy.
"Company spent all of 2014 getting customers out of the branch by showing customers other methods of banking, now Company're spending all of 2015 trying to get customers back into the branch"
pay not good.
paid to have fun.
always looking over your shoulder micro managing management.
The days off/flexibility not great.
Bankers should not be broke and not able to get a personal loan or day off while expected to smile and offer credit and loans to people.
pay more.
be more.
Alabama.
Hard to advance in this area.
Regional manager has unrealistic expectations and does not look out for Regional manager's employees.
Most of the staff in my area is new because Regional manager has ran Most of the staff in my area off.
The employees at the branches are typically great but Regional manager is not.
Team Lead in Final Documentation Dept.
In this position I was able to lead employees in a daily workflow system to ensure that Investors were delivered quality and error free documents in a timely manner.
Interesting.
The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction that I was able to assist customers with customers's financial needs.
Most co-workers were great.
I absolutely love working in the banking industry and customer service..
I worked in the banking industry for years and I learned a lot about customer service and cash handling.
In banking it is imperative that you are fully alert in all functions of the job.
"I was a full time teller working the drive up and assisting the lines, it was challenging, busy and fun."
productive place.
"i came in punch in and began my day i keyed what i seen on my double screen and had to do it in a timely manner, the enviroment was smooth laid back"
Fun work environment more transparency needed.
Normally a typical work day begins with a team huddle to discuss any changes and focus on making a typical work day a better day.
The main thing I learned working at this bank is always be flexible and willing to make any necessary adjustments to complete an escalated issue.
Very calm work setting with set work hours.
"A typical day at this bank entailed arriving to work on time, making sure all opening procedures were followed, and always beginning your day with a second associate."
We made sure the branch was opened on time and always helped customers with a smile on our faces and assisted customers with any issues customers had with customers's accounts.
"I learned a lot about the bank setting and how to handle cash, and maintain the operations side of this bank in order."
I managed three tellers under my supervision and assigned three tellers personal goals to ensure the branch achieved three tellers's monthly goals.
"The hardest part of my job was learning how to work in a bank setting, being that my job was my first job at a bank."
The most enjoyable part was being a part part of a branch that consistently achieved a branch that consistently achieved their monthly goals's monthly goals.
Bank on the hours.
Great hours and excellent co-workers but the hardest thing about working at this bank is there gray area in policies and procedures.
One this bank will allow things to slide while others wont.
"Over all, this bank is a very good company and cares about this bank's associates but can be lost when your faced with contradictions."
Retail Banking in Grocery Stores Fails to Deliver.
"My position was placed inside of a supermarket where we would attempt to leverage banking needs to people buying people buying their dinner, weekly groceries, or even their lunch's dinner, weekly groceries, or even people buying their dinner, weekly groceries, or even their lunch's lunch - many failures existed and a lot of the opportunities were dead-leads The exhausting 10 week training course was great for someone like myself who was unfamiliar with retail banking concepts, but the repetitive nature became annoying quickly and felt like the company wasted time with internal principles that didn't fully apply to my position."
"the company really didn't set an employee up to be successful in the supermarket banking world and could have provided more training to overcome objections and develop sales strategies One thing the company fails to understand in the Mid-Atlantic area is the company's branches in supermarkets are failing - plagued with overly high turn over, poor foot traffic, and ineffective marketing strategies for their branches in supermarkets it caused employees who have terrible attitudes about employees who have terrible attitudes about their jobs's jobs."
"I had the displeasure of being hired before a branch was built fully and was forced to float around the Mid-Atlantic area - not only did I meet many dissatisfied people who could careless about many dissatisfied people who could careless about their jobs at this bank's jobs at this bank, I witnessed many people simply quit from many people's jobs on a weekly basis As for the compensation the compensation was rather minimal for myself and colleagues as a traditional branch brought more foot traffic in than myself and colleagues did and myself and colleagues were highly overstaffed with employees waiting for myself and colleagues's new branch to be built / finished."
"Moreover, had my manager not been very supporting I wouldn't have stayed past training If you - more..."
"Good People, Good environment, High expectations.."
Good place to work.
Great people and a good balance for life.
Sometimes things can get hectic.
You have to really be able to roll with the punches.
Great job!.
One of the best jobs I have ever had.
One of the best jobs I have ever had. has helped me grow a lot as a professional and is a great enviroment to be in.
I can tell this compnay cares about this compnay's employees.
"Great workplace for women,."
"This company cares that you have a life outside of This company's bank, This company promote from within which is rare, down sides are that when your are promoted from within you get only a get a small raise."
the incentive pay for bankers is very competitive.

I have worked for this bank for almost 20 years.
I have worked in the Mortgage department with modifications then proceeded to be a loan officer for 16 yrs.
When National City became this bank I worked in.

I got my first promotion as a Teller Supervisor within two years.
I wish I could work with a great company like this bank.
Great Place to Learn.  
this bank has one of the greatest training programs in the industry.
This alone makes this bank a great place to start a banking career.
"Management can be a bit much at times, but I was lucky to have a great Mentor at this bank."
Always changing.
I would not recommend this job to anyone.
"This company can never keep anyone, because of the low pay and the constant push for sales."
Terrible management.
I've never seen a company go through employees so quickly!
Highly Charged Up young and dynamic environment.
Provides the best training for a campus fresher.
"Helps groom a traine Has excellent hierarchical structure , has a great EnR for continuous learning and development."
Excellent appraisal system.
A very nice a warm environment place to work in.

"A typical day a work is processing checks; cash, withdraw and deposit checks."
Management/co-workers are very concerned about my productivity and how I'm doing in a positive way.
The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything and everyone is safe and secure.
The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure that the customers are satisfied with my level of service to the customers at the end of the day.
Career Opportunities Abound.
Stable IT environment with good leaders.
Lots of opportunities to learn and grow within the different areas of the bank.
not a good place to work.
"no communication any where in the company, I would not recommend working her unless you are friends with the manager or you like to kiss butt Thanks the only way you will get along or make it there"
Productive and fun work place.
Helping customers manage customers's daily expenses and perform routine transactions while provided beneficial alternatives to traditional banking.
Leran as you go enviornment.
I had been with this bank for 3 years and nothing has changed.
Management/ Employee relationship is way too personal and not by any means professional.
this bank hire the wrong people and blame you for not being able to turn this bank into selling all stars when this bank've had absolutely no selling experience.
Micromanagement and favoritism among employees with no sense of recognition.
"No wonder why this bank has so many job openings, too much turnover, it's because this bank can't hire the right people and when this bank do, this bank do not pay well at all."
I would not work for this bank ever again nor recommend this bank to anyone.
Highmark.
"Overall very good company, lots of perks for working for the company."
Normal work-life balance.
"Worked there for 9 years, mostly enjoyable learning experience."
Great summer job.

Learned how to manage different groups of people towards managerial skills i would later use in my life

Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explain situations to people and help give people some piece of mind.
Decent Job.
Each day is filled with different good and bad things happening.
"I learned I need to do my own research from even with other departments The Management Expect you to do your job and make their jobs easy Your co-workers depending on how long Your co-workers have been there, can either be of great assistance or a pleasant way to blow off steam."
The most enjoyable part is when you can help a customer your trying to collect from.
Very professional workplace that offers many opportunities for advancement.
I really enjoyed how this bank values involvement with the community.
this bank makes sure this bank's clients are taken care of and are made to feel special and important.
My favorite part of my job was seeing my clients everyday and I even had some that would come in just to visit.
"I also really enjoyed counting large amounts of money on a daily basis managing the ATM, vault, and shipping and receiving money orders to stock the branch."
The hardest part of my job was cold calling.
People do not take well to cold calling but often times cold calling must me done to make sales goals.
Grocery store banking is a joke.
The distribution model that this bank has put in place in the grocery market is laughable at best.
"The absolute lack of professionalism, and poor quality of senior management, guiding the process leaves the employee feeling like a preschooler approaching a school bully in the aisles of the store."
"I have never been more humiliated by my association with an organization than by this joke of a job, which was sold as a fantastic opportunity for a new career."
I think not.
Review.  
this bank offers employees great opportunities to grow individually and as a team.
"this bank are truly a good company to work for, but you have to work hard for what you want."
Great Place to Work.
I loved working at this bank.
I am looking for a new career because I will be moving out of the Cleveland area.
I would love to stay with this bank if I was able to find work closer to where I will be living.
Management.
The management is great to work with.
The management are very understanding during the training and are there for you when you need something.
Fun workplace.  
this bank acquired RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) after only one year of working for RBC (Royal Bank of Canada).
Never had a problem with RBC (Royal Bank of Canada)
but i think this bank could it done a better job with the transition.
Productive and fun place to work.
Enjoyed working with co-workers and learned how to be a team player.
Had many great experiences in the 13 years that I worked there.
"High pressure, little management support, poor executive staff."
Branch roles are all about sales and very little about service.
Company executives expect a 30+ min solutions assessment conversation with 'every' customer or you must explain why you didn't have a 30+ min solutions assessment conversation with 'every' customer.
Highly micromanaged with little support from upper management.
Lobby engagement - or the 'WalMart greeter' job - is unpopular with customers and staff but upper management insists on making the staff perform Lobby engagement - or
the 'WalMart greeter' job Some branch managers were absolutely horrible - one in particular went thru 14 employees in 2 years - yet was not only supported by but promoted by regional management.
You have to be really liked by someone with influence or with a member of upper management to get promoted.
You will not be promoted on skill alone (but this may be symptomatic of corp American in general).
It's Banking.
A lot of work for minimal pay.
"Great work schedule, with all holidays off, Sundays off and shorter hours on Saturdays."
Account perks were nice.
A typical day.
I work in the consumer direct division which is a call center environment working on retention of current customers.
You get leads from the bank portfolio to call on and attempt to refinance.
There are a lot of streamline customer's available.
"The biggest issue is when you do your job as a group and overload processing, they will turn the rates higher and slow production down."
Not bad but pay stinks.
I loved the company the company benefits and everything that I was able to learn there from coworkers and management but pay is not good.
Very good employer.
Good place to work and healthy team environment.
Work and Life balance.
Excellent benefits and support from management
Good hours with competitive incentives.
You are able to work 9-5 and have many holidays off.
It takes some time getting to know customers.
There are a lot of changes taking place in the banking world which can be hard to explain to the customers.
Productive place and great place to work at.
I loved this place.
I learned a lot of thing in processing mail and I was also very fast at learning the different forms and techniques of processing.
I loved that they moved me out of the processing room and trained me on the computer to put in the information for ATM cards.
I was excited to move up and I truly thought that.
I was going to get hired on permanently and they told me that.
I thought that I had a job to grow from and I would be there for some years to come.
"I did everything they asked me to do and they told me that they where going to hire me and they turned around and gave a job to grow from to a person that was always late, or calling off and hardly knew what a person that was always late, or calling off and hardly knew what she was doing was doing."
"They hired a person that was always late, or calling off and hardly knew what she was doing permanently."
I was so crushed.
But all and all I did love a job to grow from
Interesting and challenging place to work.
Working at this bank back as a consultant was a challenging opportunity as this bank were introducing processes and methodologies for managing this bank's IT environment.
Good work/life balance.
It is a nice organization to work for if a person is clearly at an established level within a person's career who is looking for a person's last job.
People tend to coast and are very comfortable not progressing or pushing boundaries for improvement.
It is an environment that breeds stability and mediocrity.
Bait and Switch at Miracle Mile.
"I applied for a CSA position, and was hired."
"I was informed that I would be working mainly at a service desk, with limited time on the teller line ( I was told 90% service desk / 10% teller line)."
"I found this to be acceptable, having 8 years of banking experience, I was interested in learning more about customer service / account opening and sales than working on the teller side."
I was completely mislead.
"I worked at the Miracle Mile branch for 8 months, and in 8 months, was on the teller line everyday, with very minimal time at a service desk."
"The turn over rate for tellers at the Miracle Mile branch is ridiculous, I believe this is due to low wages and incredibly poor management skills."
"tellers must handle extremely large amounts of cash and are faced with the possibility of armed robbery daily, stress levels are through the roof."
"I inquired with my manager, and my manager reacted in a very unprofessional manor."
"I was then berated as to who told me this information, which by the way, my manager did and basically, I was treated as though I was being reprimanded, for inquiring about my current position."
"In truth, I feel I was hired for a CSA position, and my manager just placed me where my manager needed a body."
"At this point, I decided that there was something drastically wrong with what I had been told at the interview, and with the treatment I received from the management."
I knew that I was never going to be able to perform the position that I had been hired for.
"So within a month, I found a position with another company, paying much better and without the micromanaging."
another company could - more...
Nice place to work if you enjoy talking to people about services !!.
"Open branch, perform night drop bags before opening, servicing customers needs(deposits,check cashing, payments etc) Lobby engagement with customers."
Engage in conversation to help customers get every service that we offer .
Balancing at end of day.
"Performing various closing duties,"
knowledgable.
It was an great and growing experience to work for this bank My knowledge during that time was grown extensively and I came to meet some of the best co-workers I still call friends today.
Productive and fun place to work for.. I had just started my career in IT and it was very stressful to work with large team and understanding business.
My manager coached and help me a lot.
Felt very good during completion of my project.
I did learned a lot about IT industry and finance while at this bank.
Initially I was overwhelm by the data
but once I started to see the data in smaller segment the data was comprehensible.
Name Change - Game Change.
Ability to grow within the company was unlimitless.
In some instances management encouraged the growth of employees reporting to management.
Other instances management was extremely difficult to communicate with - unable to locate or reach by phone.
"Productive, fun and a great learning experience."
"A typical day at work is helping customers with customers's transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and account reviews I have learned a great deal since I started in June 2014."
"I learned business banking, and improved my communication skills and customer service as well."
"I love my co-workers, I really enjoy working with my co-workers, that is another reason why I am so happy to go to work everyday"
The challenging part of the job is having zero difference at the end of every shift The most enjoyable part of the job is having a conversation with customers and co-workers
Few people and data to do what was needed. chasing down data alone.
mortgage industry from various viewpoints.

"Good atmosphere, room to advance."
Overall good experience at this bank.
There are any opportunities to move up if you are willing to work hard.
Very good experience with management.

Not a fan of the hour lunches.
Feel like the hour lunches's a waste of time.
"Also, feeling like there is no balance between work and life is hard."
Good place to work but could be better..
The pay is in the lower range of the industry but they treat their employees very well and are very big on the work life balance.
Yes.
"Installed, Configured and administered WebLogic server 10.3.6 for development, testing and production environment on RHEL6.4 platform."
Installed and configured Apache 2.2 with Oracle WebLogic Application server.
Great company.
Company provides support and opportunities to all employees.
Overall great experience in the private client group.
Would recommend the private client group to all bankers.
Just another corporation.
"Being a teller is not mentally challenging, but corporate requirements and training will make you feel like you're an idiot who needs to be told common sense things at least three times a day Have you seen Office Space You will be told the same thing by multiple bosses."
You will be ridiculed and penalized for doing non-work things even when there hasn't been anyone at the bank in hours.
You will be lectured about how you should be getting more people to sign up for accounts no matter how well you're doing or how implausible the goal.
"You may work with great people, but you shouldn't think anyone is your friend, no matter how much it seems like this bank is trying to encourage you to have a best friend at work."
"If you don't have a college degree and don't mind going through the monotony and company grind, there are some opportunities for advancement that may benefit you."
"Also, your experience may be very different depending on where you work."
I visited many different branches in the central Illinois area and your daily experience is largely determined by your co-workers.
"Some branches are much more laid back and willing to laugh with you, and others will be filled with supervisors who will, at every opportunity, try to repress your individuality and diminish your self-worth."
I was unhappy with everything at this bank.
the Management was unprofessional.
The guidelines were unclear.
The was no help or chance for advancement.
I felt alone when I had questions.
It seemed that everyone was micro managed so much so that it took the personality of of the employee.
Productive work envioronment with an excellent moral amongst team members..
A typical days would consist of with the basics which included entering the borrowers' information into the system and then creating a file for each.
I reviewed each loan request thoroughly to determine what type of vendor items I would need to order and what documentation I may need from the customer to process the customer's loan application.
"Additionally, the vendor items I would order would be title policy, flood certification, appraisal, Hazard Insurance, Condo blanket insurance policy."
I learned in this business how to adapt to change very quickly as a Lenders' guidelines can change quite often and as a Processor/Credit Analyst it is a Processor/Credit Analyst's responsibility to this job to a Lenders' guidelines to ensure a Processor/Credit Analyst have a sale able credit worthy loan.
The hardest part of this job was obtaining cash contributions from the seller for the short sale the seller were trying to get approved.
Loved working for the company.
Back issues which kept me from efficiently performing excel level.
It is fun to work in a micro management department.
I like this company we treat each other like a family.
I learned how to handle different kind of job functions.
this bank is a good company overall..  
"this bank is a great company to work for but this bank need to train this bank's employees on everything, not just opening accounts, if this bank want this bank's employees to sell this bank's product, this bank need a class on just that!"
this bank expect you to know everything on your own.
great place to work.
"great place to work, great benefits and enjoyed my time there."
ok.  
this bank did try to appreciate this bank's employees.
this bank even had a week where this bank did things for their employees.
I have no complaints about working here.
It was nice to have holidays off.
I would recommend this bank to someone looking for a job
not happy.
"not happy there, compensation is not worth the amount of work put in, management is not where management should be."
"Sales goals are required, but if customer service score for branch is low then you lose all the sales you accomplished."
Community Involvement.
Working at the Flint Housing was the most satisfying roles I have ever had.
I learned that people are so underserved and need constant support with a variety of services from life skill to education.
I had a great manager who made sure I understood the goals and the expectations of a great manager who made sure I understood the goals and the expectations of him and the organization and the Flint Housing.
Great people and place to work.
I am currently in a rotational development program.
Management is great and really seems to care about your progress.
Very Relaxed Atmosphere.
I am very interactive with my co workers in balancing ideas or exchanging product knowledge.
I am a very understanding and an excellent communicator.
If I'm on the phone my personality relays just as well as if I'm physically in person with that individual.
I am a very fast and efficient learner and adjust very well with change and transitioning within the office environment.
overall good employee experience.
bad management led to very stressful days not enough employees at my particular branch to service the customers adequately lack of employee engagement and ethic makes it stressful
this bank Mortgage has a wonderful diverse culture..
"The position I held was a call center environment and consisted of making outbound calls and intercepting inbound calls from customers and authorized personnel in order to assist with applying for loss mitigation, discuss loss mitigation options, process mortgage payments, discuss or explain needed documentation, and/or to begin foreclosure proceedings."
I learned various databases and strengthened my organization and prioritization skills.
I working with management on special projects and assisted with the training of new employees and/or the re-training of seasoned employees.
The co-workers are wonderful and are from various life types which I throughly enjoyed.
The hardest part of the job was declining modification assistance to customers but the most rewarding part was being able to offer modification assistance.
I love working at this bank.
Greate company culture..
I love working at this bank.
this bank is a great place to work.
The company culture is great.
The work life balance is appreciated.
Does not hire contract employees.
Can not provide adaquate review as I'm only a temporary employee.
A challenging and rewarding work environment..
An emphasis on teamwork creates the best kind of atmosphere to be productive
My ongoing training and testing whether it's courses on the ever changing government regulations or product knowledge provides me the platform to help guide clients in the best possible way to achieve clients's financial goals.
"When done right this is mutually beneficial for all, which gives me great satisfaction."
bad.
I was not happy working for this bank unfortunately this bank promote salesmen to be managers without management growth and that's not righ this bank need to learn more about management and provide this bank's employees with special training to be a manger
CULTURE is good.
"Good work enviroment to learn areas to sharpen, the leadership role is great!!!"
"If you enjoy being told what to do and how to do it, this company is for you!."
"Benefits package is decent, salary is below industry standard."
Great people to work with.
Autonomous thinking is not encouraged by management.
Great appraisl team players.
Typical day is knowing how well I was there to help in ever department I can in order to process the loan..
"I have learned allot in the appraisal department, I felt really comfortable with all my team mates."
Management was great with all the employees..
Days were very easy working with the Vendor.
Hardest part was just waiting for a reply from a email..
Co-workers.
"Management is not the easiest to work with, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
customer service.
Some days we are very busy with customers and other days not so much.
I act as a teller and a customer service rep.
Both areas are very demanding.
As a teller I would take in cash deposits and also disperse money.
"I also open accounts, credit cards, and help customers with customers's existing accounts to make sure that customers are in the best account that will make the most money for customers."
Do not do it.
The only good thing I can say about this bank is that the customers are awesome!!!!
Management is out for Management.
Management come and go as Management feel say whatever Management want to say to staff ( even racist things) and are lazy.
I was so happy to leave this bank to start my internship.
It's a job..
A decent place to work but the management needs to listen to employee concerns more often.
Energetic and positive work environment.
Great place to work.01 Philanthropic opportunities through the Grow Up Great program and many and a positive environment.
Great Work Environment.
Helped to resolve customer issues and open new account.
I gave recommendations to customer to better customer's financial situation.
Helped customer investment for retirement and have peace of mind for the future.
"Project work, not enough to make an opinion."
didn't work here for long.
Project work and a bland environment.
"People rarely talked to eachother, but thats just where I was at."
"This was the corporate building, not a branch."
"Enjoyable Place to work, Typical Corpoate Environment.  "
this bank is a friendly environment and offers a lot of resources to this bank's employees.
this bank University offers free training to advance your knowledge of the industry.
My experience of management has been a good one.
I have a manager that understands work/life balance and is in-tune with our needs as an employee.
The most frustrating part of the job is the forever changing decisions of upper management.
"If there is a process change, a process change usually comes quick and without explanation."
Good company to work for..
"My job with this bank consisted of dealing with the personnel files for the employees in several markets, such as Pittsburgh."
My day was made up of printing the list of new hires that a file needed to be made for.
"Then I would go into the system that generated the documents that were to go into a file, and file labels were printed."
I also would deal with managers that needed to review a file for hiring purposes.
I would sit with an employee while an employee looked over an employee's file when an employee requested to do
so I was given special projects to do as well.
I found special projects to do to be a good learning tool that helped me with my job.
M
My job was very fulfilling and I was very confident in my abilities..
My management skills were not forceful and I treated my employees with respect.
I would not ask my employees to perform duties that I would not know and perform.
I tried to keep a friendly but business like atmosphere in my department.
My employees respected me and always gave me an above average rating.
Awesome bank.
Great place to work for.
A lot of potential for growth.
No micro-managing at this place.
Freedom to explore your talents
Fun working place to be.
"assisted customers with daily transactions, withdraws, transfers"
Productive work place.
"I was employed with this bank for close to 13years and during this time, this bank was very good to me."
I was disappointed that my position was eliminated due to a lay off
"but I believe that even though this was quite detrimental, there is something better in store for me."
Good Job/Bad Management.
The job The job itself was good with okay benefits and pay.
The management wasn't very fair however and you would get in trouble for mistakes you didn't make.
It seems like they're moving towards eliminating tellers altogether as a company and a lot of their competitors pay more.
Good company to start in banking..
This is a good company to work for and get started in banking.
Very Good.
"Worked for this company for 3 years, Very good management team at the time."
Challenging yet simple.
"I love working for this bank, NA."
"The job is at a steady, productive pace."
Not a good job for me. did not like this job at all.
after 90 day trial period both the company and I knew this job was not the job for me.
Fast pace and fun place to work.
A typical day of work at this bank consists of constant Bank transactions which progressively and consistently made me better at my job as a teller.
It taught me that i can deal with various and or any type of customer with accuracy patience and kindness.
The management at this bank was efficient and fair.
"My co-workers were great, My co-workers helped each other and relied on each other on an hourly basis."
The hardest part of the job at this bank was on paydays.
"I had to efficiently and quickly handle the customers transactions and relate to the customers, while keeping the length of the line to a minimum in the drive way and in this bank at the same time, which was also the funnest part of my job.."
Enjoyed the teller position.
A typical day was learning new skills in the banking institution.
Co-workers were an enjoyable team to work with.
Interresting and challenging workplace.
Great Company.
Always busy and challenged with interesting projects.
production and deadline driven environment.
Conduct meeting with business sponsors to elicit requirements.
Translate the business requirements into User Stories.
Met with the development team and QA team to review the business requirements to make sure the business requirements's clearly understood.
Assist PM run daily scrums.
Rewarding in regards to helping the customers but frustrating in regards to quality of life and balancing paperwork with service.
Meeting and speaking with a diverse group of people is wonderful.
I have learned how to network with people and help people understand how money management affects other areas of people's life.
"Therefore, successful management is necessary."
"successful management allowed me to combine my ability to teach with understanding finance to help people create, meet and exceed people's goals."
this bank prides this bank on this bank's core values but this is a skewed perspective.
"I have found quality of life is contingent upon the mindset of the manager which determines if quality of life is exercised The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the large amounts of paper work, being expected to perform well in sales and being relational with customers without selling unwanted or needed products simultaneously."
"Teller, Carmichaels PA."
Worst company I have ever worked for.
The turn over rate is astronomical.
"When I got hired I had no 'hands on' training, was thrown right into the position."
"The TS at the branch is horrible, mean and arrogant."
Not family orientated business what so ever as they make their selfs out to be.
"Was promised I would be working 30 hours a week, with benefits and vacation time, got none of the above."
The first of the year was cut down to 22 hours.
No room for advancedment.
Would not recommend anyone to work here!
"Great place to work, awesome people, great job opportunity."
It has been a real pleasure working at this bank.
I have made a lot of great friends both peers and with management.
The learning is pretty much hands on so if you're into that type of working environment this bank is the place for you.
"There is so much opportunity with this bank, plenty of room to move up and expand."
Good place to learn and easy to grow within company.
Easy to take trascations from customers.
Easy environment to learn from.
Opening and closing accounts.
Helping customers with customers's everyday money management.
Balancing cash drawers at the end of the day.
Great place to work.
This job was a great place to work.
"This job paid very well, was flexible and the people there were more like family than co-workers."

Upper Management does not care.
I worked there as a branch manager and it was the worse place I have worked at in a long time.
"I was told by some to be aware of the Regional manager and Upper Management, but I thought maybe the Regional manager and upper management were just an upset employee who quit, but I found out how so true."
My boss maybe came to my branch twice in 2 years and was no support.
Was cursed out by a disgruntle employee and Upper Management asked for a disgruntle employee to come back to work.
No Support!!

Wonderful Place.
Great place to work at.
The team environment was wonderful.
I love my job even though the merge cause a lot of people to lose a lot of people's job.
I would recommend my job to friends and family.
I still have friends that are working there and really enjoy the atmosphere and the benefits.
Productive company.
 Very responsible company to work for.
Learned a lot and gained knowledge in conducting money transactions; Setting up accounts;
Accepting deposits and withdrawals; Processing loan payments; Transferring money between accounts; Cashing checks;
this bank/Teller.
This position was one which required minimal experience in the field.
This was my first employment with a financial institution.
There was also minimal challenge.
This position was pleasant as were the customers.
Any knowledge that was needed for This position was taught during training out of a training facility for this bank/Teller.
"Previous experience I had likely helped guide me to think this to be a very minimally challenging experience for me, as I had already dealt with customers, handled cash and processed transactions regularly."
"All in all this was a pleasant experience, but I preferred a bit more of a challenge which is why I resigned to focus more on obtaining my Bachelor's degree more quickly."
"If the pay were better, I would have likely stayed and tried to progress further in this bank/Teller, but it was not what I was looking for."
Professional Workplace.
You will meet a wide variety of people from co-workers to clients.
If banking is your passion then Professional Workplace could be the place for you.
High Turnover Rate.
"A typical day at work depends on what area you work in, In the PG county area the branch is always busy and the management was always focused on sales and what could you get from the customers the management didn't care about what the customer actually needed or didn't need the management just wanted us to sell."
The work job life and work life balance was very uncompromising because we worked 8hrs a day Saturday through Monday and Sunday we were open for five hrs as well as certain holidays so only your vacation was a way to get away and actually enjoy some home life.
There was never any job security at this bank this bank looked at you as a liability if you didn't earn this bank money or if you were costing this bank money and advancement was chosen by not how hard you work but the major of the advancement I've seen came by favoritism.
If there is a turn around in management the job culture would be a lot better because the stress starts small but when the stress builds from the upper class management down the stress shows throughout the company down to the FSC so the company needs to work on the company's management and job culture as a whole.
The compensation....
WHAT the whole breakdown and system that the company have is ridiculous I never was satisfied with my quarterly earnings plus it took to long to receive such antipated income....
sorry wasn't good enough for me!!
The benefits well you still pay more out your pocket then what they cover so there you go!!
It was a interesting experience and I met interesting people
but I am blessed to have found somewhere else that cares for me and actually cares about the customer and not the - more...
The Employee Comes First!.
"At this bank, your opinions seem to count."
"There is a great culture of inclusion and respect through weekly district calls, yearly employee surveys, and continuous learning & coaching."
"Great Culture, Genuinely Care about clients."
I've worked for this bank for years and this bank are successful by doing what's in this bank's clients best interest.
this bank do not product push and goals are attainable.
Culture is fun and you build relationships with co-workers.
The only con I have about this bank is this bank's compensation to loyal and long standing team members.
Great place to work!.
This was my first job.
It taught me a lot about work ethic and focus.
I became close friends with all of my co-workers and I would go back if I could.
Going in the right direction..
I honestly can say I love my job.
"After doing something similar at another large bank, you can tell another large bank does things a bit differently."
"I feel like upper management cares about me, knows my name, and treats me fairly."
Everyday I'm home around 5:15 which promotes great work/life balance.
"I feel like I have enough time to do the work asked of me, and if I have a question I know I can reach out to quite a few people to help The ONE thing I don't like is the training."
the training's very minimal and inconvenient.
"I think I could've benefited from more training than just a week, there's a lot to learn!"
"Other than that, another large bank is a great place to work."
Productive and was not conflicting with personal life.
I loved the atmosphere and the people that I worked with.
The only reason that I was not able to stay was because of my school schedule
Good work balance.
Sustained pressure to meet production targets Learnt to be able direct one self.
A nice and a professional working place.
"In a typical working day i had a great team of workers,good supervision by managers."
Obviously the hardest part is the end of the day where you balance your cash drawer to prove you had no shortages or overages.
The fun aspect is convincing customers to subscribe to a particular product
Productive work place..
"A typical day at this bank can vary from many things account openings, account closings, debit/credit card transactions, money orders, cashiers checks, international wire transfers."
Garda pick-up currency orders.
Also a significant amount of cash handling The management at this bank means well.
Very well focused on how this bank's numbers look and the money this bank have coming in and out of the branch.
Management at this bank works hard on this bank's team to make this bank the best of the best but lacks on making this bank feel like the best.
this bank're always pointed out on this bank's flaws and not so much this bank's strong points.
"Working for this bank you're never going to be at the top of your game, there is always something you lack on My co-workers at this bank are like a second family My co-workers at this bank are My co-workers at this bank's own little team and My co-workers at this bank are always there for one another."
"My co-workers at this bank know when to get things done, how to and My co-workers at this bank know when My co-workers at this bank can sit back and relax because My co-workers at this bank know the job is done correctly The hardest part of my career with this bank is getting recognition for the hard work you do day in and day out seven days a week."
Working out every unresolved issue and problem with peoples accounts or just giving peoples a peace of mind on some confusion is hard work knowing everyday you walk in those doors you never know what is going to be brought to your attention or brought to the table
The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer walk out of those doors with a smile on a customer's face knowing a customer can trust me and that a customer have all there finances in the right hands.
Knowing when a customer comes back a customer are going to be the most loyal customer a business - more...
Great place to work.
Typical day at work is getting on the phones and helping customers.
We would have team meetings and did many cool team related training activities.
Training was extensive.
90+ days of training.
Bonded well with my co-workers.
productive.
great place to work.
the employers care about you as a person.
Great for college grads.
I started working at this bank when I graduated from college and it was good to learn how to work in a fast pace environment.
Now the pay is not great at all but the experience you can not put a price on

"There was no movement upwards, became stuck in the same spot until I moved to Collateral Clerk position."
Good Place To Work.  
this bank Mortgage was your typical mortgage environment.
this bank Mortgage was a place that employed dedicated and hard working individuals.
this bank Mortgage provided the proper training that you needed to excel in your position.
Your managers were also making sure that you needs were met and had high quality communication skills.
Nepotism talent need not apply!.
I worked out of the operations center.
At first they hired me to a good position with promises of work life balance and a cooperative work environment and career growth.
"Instead I found an environment rife with turmoil, in office back biting, ineffective and abusive leadership."
Every time and I do mean every time when the management had an opportunity to show that the management believed and stood by the core principals professed by the company... like say every employee matters...
the management not only showed no empathy to employees but buried employees under the excuse 'the companies needs'.
Also don't expect to have your ideas and attempts at collaborative teamwork and sharing to be valued.
Unless sanctioned by the upper management down you are not to be a high performer as this may reflect poorly on the abilities of other longer tenured employees and in turn hurt how other longer tenured employees look.
Oh and when doing your job do not do your job
so well you get recognized by higher ups for your effort!
"If you are given a plaque, trophy, certificate to hang on the wall try and hide a plaque, trophy, certificate to hang on the wall don't display a plaque, trophy, certificate to hang on the wall even if asked to by the upper management down as your tenured co-workers and direct management will begin to make your life miserable and throw you under the bus anytime possible."
Stable work evironment.  
"this bank is a good company to work for if you are looking for good, stable work that does not ask for much of a commitment above 40 hours."
The compensation and benefits leave much to be desired.
Productive and fun place to work.
Lots of training available..
Management was great.
Lots of opportunity for continued growth and learning.
Co-workers were always willing to lend a helping hand and make the transition to new positions very enjoyable.
Each day brought new challenges and growth which made for an enjoyable day.

"Enjoyed the job with public.. Very rewarding, the job , from a customers perspective looks very uncomplicated."
"the job was more complicated than the job looked and when your cash drawer balanced out, it was a terrific feeling."
A Somewhat Challenging IT Culture.
"Most of the challenge in moving forward or making changes is that the wheels move at a snail's pace, and communication between teams can be non-existent."
"On the other hand, the people are great, this bank understands this bank's employees have a life outside of work, and there is a lot of flexibility."

Enjoyed this company.
The people I worked with and the customers were wonderful.
I only left because I thought I was going to a better career choice and opportunity.
this bank....
Working at this bank has many Pros/Cons like any company..
I must say that this bank has a lot of 'micromanagement' which can make this bank's employees uncomfortable as well as no flexibility with a work/school/personal life balance.. but this bank offer a lot of benefits.
"Great Coworkers, Bad Management."
There is opportunity to learn from your coworkers but there is a lack of management assistance to see you move forward in your position.
Teller.
Overall great company to work for.
"Would handle large sums of cash per day, company was great with training."
Good company for upward mobility elsewhere.
I worked for this bank Investments for two years.
I was a top performer in my area.
The bank staff is first class and engaged.
Management is only focused on Management's goals not why or how you achieve their goals.
Pay is well below market average.
I never worked as hard for the compensation I earned.
"Team environment, lots to learn, will help in future endeavours.."
"My typical day at work would include signing on to my computer and catching up on emails, news reports about the company and reviewing company policies and procedures."
I've learned that teamwork is the base to all accomplishments and learning everyday makes me a be better employee.
The management is encouraging with my daily work and aides where needed.
"My co-workers are great people, My co-workers have been in the banking industry for quite a while, so I can learn from My co-workers everyday."
The hardest part of the job is taking in all the new information that the bank has to offer.
"The most enjoyable part of the job is the clients that visit me at the bank, the clients that visit me at the bank make my days a lot easier and more enjoyable."
Do not work for this bank.
Fired because I did not fit in and they were sure to bring up that it was close to my 90 days anyway.

Management is consistent within the company and supportive of your progress.
"My co-workers are hard working, driven, and fun."
"The hardest part of the job is troubleshooting; My co-workers see new problems every day, and My co-workers are expected to learn to solve new problems on My co-workers's own."
This is also the most enjoyable part of the job and keeps my days from becoming mundane or repetitive.
High Turnover.
"High turnover, aggressive sales culture, not the happiest place to work"
Great employee culture.  
this bank is a good place to work.
"Management has always been top quality, Management do seem to care about you as a person."
The pay could be better.

"Great client team concept promotes difficult internal team dynamics..  this bank's team approach to Wealth Management is a concept that clients like but not necessarily supported by management as it relates to employee compensation, responsibilities, and sales."
Unusually high employee and supervisory management turnover makes it difficult to balance existing client experience with sales.
review.
I love working for this bank.
"However, the only position available at the time was part-time."
I need full-time hours.
Previous Branch Manager.
When RBC and this bank The merger we were not given the accurate information to relay to customers.
The merger caused good employees to look elsewhere for jobs.
this bank states this bank are all about whats best for the customer but that's NOT true.
Its all about whats best for this bank's bottom line.
The pay/salaries for employees is sad very sad.
The compensation for the low salaries is that employees can earn bonuses on referrals.
Well in the more rural areas that is virtually impossible especially when your customers have all your products.
Work life balance is funny because this bank has no clue what Work life balance is.
Management does not help your thrown into doing more then one job teller/financial sales consultant/branch manager job.
I have even seen branch managers (my peers) doing the regional managers jobs.
Job security is a joke.
The upper management will lie to your face about Job security.
The upper management will close branches and your customers will know its closing before the employees do.
Co-workers/employees were great and work hours were great.
No Saturdays.
this bank.
• Identifying sales opportunities and making referrals to ecosystem partners as appropriate.
• Quality customer interactions.

• Manage the costumer experience for my branch.
Fun place to work.
I really felt like this bank cared about me as a person.
this bank is an amazing company to work for and this bank really do take care of this bank's employees.
Compensation isn't as good as Compensation should be but this bank take this bank's time to train you and this bank are interested in helping you grow.
this bank.
Upbeat team I worked with and great training.
I had a motivated team and loved how this bank kept new promotions for customers.
"Smart, reliable, hard working individual.. Arrive a little early to prepare for the day."
Great relationships with management and co-workers.
Learn something new every day.
Most enjoyable part: interacting with co-workers and customers.
Most Difficult: keeping track of multiple passwords.
nice place bad politics and pay.
Its all about who you know.
Pay wasn't very well either.
Management went through a lot of changes too
Enjoyed being a part of.
love working there.
great place to work.
fast quick pace.
lots of benefits and advancements
Good place to work.
I highly recommend this place of work.
this place of work have competitive wages and decent benefits.
I also personally like this place of work's products and services.
Challenging and rewarding job.
I thoroughly enjoyed working in the bank.
I started as a teller and advanced to teller supervisor.
I had many responsibilities and worked with many different people.
I enjoyed it.
Terrible experience.
I didn't make it past the 8 week training...
If you want to call it training It was pretty much a joke.
The people training in the 'bull pen' don't even know what The people training in the 'bull pen' are doing.
The people training in the 'bull pen' claim The people training in the 'bull pen' want people to be compassionate yet in every phone call there is literally 20 things you must get out or you fail QA.
No wonder the turn over rate is ridiculous.
This was the worst experience I've ever had at a job.
Great company with many opportunities for advancement.  
this bank is a wonderful company that allows this bank's employees to grow at its employees's own pace.
this bank fosters a great work/life balance and helps this bank's employees reach its employees's professional goals.
this bank brings all different lines of business together to form a cohesive team in the workplace.
good work place.
good people decent management and work life balance i little to micro managed but not bad
Headed in the wrong direction!!
and fast!!
"Turnover is horrible, Everyone is barely hanging on.. Empty promises."
Upper Management is a nightmare..
Need big changes.
Starts at the top.. HR is not for the employees rather works to get people out for any reason.
If it wasn't for my co-workers I would have quit 5 months ago.
Management is inconsistent.
Each branch is ran completely different.
Part timers are treated less important.
As a part timer you have no sick or personal days and no vacation until 1 year.
"If your child is sick you must have a back up plan, if your back up isn't available you must have a back up plan for a back up plan, otherwise you're screwed I have my co-workers, if it wasn't for my co-workers helping me get through I day I wouldn't have lasted these 6 months."
Oh and you're forced to take a mandatory 5 days off in a row and BECAUSE YOU'RE PART TIME it's unpaid!!!
So you're forced to take off a week without pay.
"I don't know about you, but that pretty much screws all of my finances."
I am now behind on a lot of stuff because of a mandatory 5 days off in a row Hardest part of the job is to follow each policy (which there are a lot) with every customer.
good experince.
Working at this bank is good experience for multi-tasking and talking to customers from all walks of life.
"I learned how to stay organized, and provide excellent customer service."
"As well, I learned how to help people with people's everyday finances."
Good company.
Good company keep the place fun with contests and events.
I am in the credit card department and i am learning many new things and getting information from other departments so i can avoid transferring for the simple questions.
productive and fun place for work environment.
I love my job.
"I like being around people, my coworkers are great and helpful."
"Difficult part of my duties is when someone ask me for help I cannot deny, even sometimes I will take my personal time to help someone."
great place.
"Great place to work for, good benefits and even better coworkers."
I cant complain about management either
Horriable work enviroment.
Manger is total nut case!
"Manger will stalk you on Facebook and other social networks, get other employees in the branch to find out about your personal life by stalking you as well."
Manger Daily does things to make it horrible to work with Manger.
"Manger constantly bullies Manger's employees into thinking that Manger has the power to fire you at any given moment, Manger delegates Manger's work out to all the employees and does basically nothing Manger, if you ask Manger a question Manger gets angry at you and retaliates by giving you more work to do that Manger is suppose to be doing."
Manger offers no positive feed back about the work you do only responses with negativity.
Upper management has been informed of this and still nothing is done with Manger.
Best watch your back if you go to work here!
Not just with Upper management but with all employees at branch!
Great place to work!.

Not a good workplace enviroment.
I worked there for 4 years and the company has just gone down hill every single year.
the company pay a whole lot less than any other bank in town and the company ask for the world.
Tellers a continuously talked to about selling to customers even when customers don't need the products.
Upper management is distant and not very involved in what goes on.
There is no one to call when you have an issue and advancement within the company is virtually impossible.
Stay away and look for positions at a smaller bank.
Great Bank!.
I can say that the culture at this bank is one that puts customers first.
The customer centered belief model at this bank empowered me to do my job efficiently while providing the proper amount of decision making with the necessary support of upper management.

Typically we'd get pulled from the phones to be trained or have refresher courses to ensure that we're up to date on all policies both governed and company policies.
"Co-workers are like family, everyone is really close in my department."
The hardest part of the job is not having the room for growth and not being compensated for as much as Co-workers know or handle/do on the phones.
The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and if you have the right supervisor the right supervisor do little things to ensure you're happy and comfortable.

I worked in the card production department before the card production department was outsourced to Omaha.
I liked the environment and my co-workers.
Most came from different backgrounds and families.
It was a good experience.
The work was highly detail oriented and time constrained but enjoyable.
the card production department was a family within the this bank family Management was great-
Management helped when needed and never asked you to accomplish an unobtainable goal.
Management were in the trenches with you daily I enjoyed making customers happy.
At that time debit cards and ATM machines were just blossoming and being able to get a usable card in a few days meant a lot.
I was heart-broken when I was told that the card production department would be closing but they broke the news in time for me to seek out other career avenues.

Working as a bank teller.
a bank teller would get to a bank teller's job at 8 in the morning and get off at 4 in the afternoon.
"a bank teller would deal with paying the bills, cash the customers checks, withdraw money from accounts, work with cds, help with customers if customers need to get to customers's safety deposit boxes, waited on customers, did reports."
a bank teller learned how to save money and when it is good to use money and when not to use money.
The co-workers were very pleasant.
The hardest part of the job was to make sure that everyone go their money right.
The most enjoyable part of the job was laughing and communicating with the customers.
Not a good long term career.  
this bank does not care enough for this bank's employees.
you are only numbers to this bank.
Productive work place.
"Everyday is good day, a very busy environment, keying in different things, and learning new systems."
okay work environment.
"Is an okay work environment, always depends on branch and management team"
Bank job.
"Begin my day with morning duties regarding setting up my station with the cashbox, logging into the system and preparing my station for the work day."
I perform the night deposit duty as well as making a check up on the amount that is in the ATM I service.
I then begin to inspect the rest of the branch in order to make sure we are ready for to open and proceed with the day.
"Once the branch was open i proceeded to either help the tellers process transactions at my own station or proceed with lobby engagement in helping the customers with either helping the customers write out deposit slips, withdrawal slips or attend any questions or concerns the customers may have had."
I also would cross-sell products that would help improve the customers's financial well being so that the customers understood everything that the bank had to offer to the customers so the customers could fully utilize all the products at the customers's disposal.
I was able to learn how to cross sell products while also servicing the customers at the best possible ability while also learning how to engage with the customers to open up information to helping the customers better bank with us.
The majority of the team was brand new so management was a little lackluster but we have a great manager in our branch who is very helpful and involved in our growth.
For the most part the co workers are good to work with though a much more family environment could help run the branch smoother.
However the most enjoyable part of the day is when we are able to relax and have fun within the branch on slow or fast days as we like to please the customers where the customers aren't just coming into a bank and being quickly - more...
Good benefits.
"Hard to advance, no structure, have to get in the door then bounce from job to job to get a head monetarily."

Small Divsion - Office in Boston.
I worked at this bank Wealth Management for 2 years.
I enjoyed my Trust Administrator function as well as my EA function.
The divsion that employed me was a small boutique with only 8 employees.

Normally your days are predictable.
Sometimes management pushes for optional surveys to be mandatory.
Spare Yourself.
I became an employee through a merger.
I was with this bank for nearly two years.
I have since left to pursue a more professional sales career.
"While employed at this bank, I was constantly moved around to cover vacancies, thus making it more difficult for me to hit my daily and quarterly goals."
This was never accounted for.
"The pay, in comparison with other financial institutes, is pretty pathetic."
"With a four year degree and prior sales experience, I was paid right at $30k."
"(And the benefits were not good, so we used the better benefits from my husband's job.)"
I went through three managers during this time with about 6 months of no manager.
The last manager I ended up with was so HORRIBLE that my husband was going to resign for me had I not found a MUCH better career.
"this bank expects this bank's bankers to work like a horse to sell products to people who don't even need products, all while claiming to want the best for this bank's customers."
"If you have a degree, you can do better than this - I am confident in that without even knowing you!"

Our branch manager and my co workers are the best part of the job and certain regulars that come in as well.
Initial contract was for 6 months but wound up being 18 months.
Co-workers were very helpful with all the program documentation required
Great Job in Certain markets.
While Great Job in Certain markets was fantastic for learning and growing Great Job in Certain markets is highly based on location of your branch.
"If you are at a slower location they create chaos by having you go out and find accounts, but they also short staff those branches so rescheduling events takes place pretty frequently."
Fun coworkers make all the difference.
Bank Teller is a job that is very different than any job I've ever had before.

Teller.
"Every day responsibilities includes taking care of customer interactions and maintaining a presence for the company as a whole, tellers are the usually the first employees customers see and therefore are given the most face time with customers."

sad.
There is no point in trying to achieve greatest here as it is as political as Washington D.C
Either you are the chosen one or a grunt.
Wealth Management and Private Banking factions.
"If you enjoy figjting internally over a deal, having to cut yourself out of getting full credit for bringing in a piece of business in to make everyone's score card nice and pretty, tolerate obvious favortism of management for certain co-workers and have human reaources ignore interviewing employees who support your case, this the place for you."
"If you exceed your goals on paper, local management will make excuses that YOU cannot clearly have a full bonsus as those who did not make those who did not make their goals's goals deserve 'something'."
People have been forced out the door for perceptions of management but who did great jobs.
Fighting back makes you the problem.
Do not respond to 'how can we help you be more productive' as a sincere response comes back to haunt you.
The last manager brought no business in but ruled like a slave driver in ruling by fear.
The current one brings business in but only lets certain people in on the deal.
If you need to shine do not come here unless you want to shine shoes.
"When you are measured by metrics and management abandons you, you are done."

Horrible branch to work for.
"The people at this branch are awful to work for, very few believe in teamwork."
As a former employee I am glad I left.
Terrible Management.  
this bank is a great company but the Lexington region is broken.
the Lexington region is basically a dictatorship that runs counter to what this bank wants.
the Lexington region will get fixed eventually but not until regional management is replaced.
"Fun workplace environment, good team."
Very laid back environment yet dedicated to be the best we can be.
Teamwork is a big and successful part of this job.
Rewarding job when clients begin to trust you and understand that you want to advise clients onto the right path.
Worst placed to work.
"This company was the worst that I worked for, This company has bad management"
Working inside of Giant was a different experience..  
Giant was when I was able to branch off and begin the journey of a personal banker.
Which gave me independence and I learned a lot of time management.
Basically working as your own manager was the highlight was my career.
Working in Giant didn't give you the same banking environment as a traditional bank.
I helped most of my co workers since I was very knowable and I enjoyed most of my co workers.
Great place to work.
"Long hours, Lot of work, unusual hours of operation."
I work at operations department so 3 different shifts
Over all not a horrible place to work.

"I wish I could say I had a great experience here, the pay is so low, others continually left to go to other banks because the pay is higher virtually everywhere."
"Management was terrible, possibly just my Branch"
I don't know.
Compensation does not equal duties.
My experience is that they can not seem to keep quality people because they do not compensate quality people enough.
"People are frequently moving around or leaving and they leave people thinned out without urgency to staff The job The job itself is very easy but there is A LOT to remember so theft or fraud does not happen, a lot of pressure."

Underpayment for services rendered.
A typical day included assisting 9 bank branches with 9 bank branches's mortgage clients.
I had to travel everyday to 4 out of 5 branches daily.
Taking applications only occurred after conducting a needs analysis/interview with the client.
I had to review what situation the client was in and determine the client's needs.
If a client was looking for a prequalification certificate this was taken care of accordingly.
I loved my position as this point of contact for my branches but the compensation was a major issue.
Our operations team had Our operations team's challenges and was undergoing renovations so it took its toll on our efforts.
The most difficult part of my position is not having a voice within the company and essentially being asked for more and more business and not successfully closing the current business.
I had excellent relationships with my branch partners because I made sure I communicated daily with my branch partners and reported updates.
I definitely enjoyed my position and the people.
the compensation is not where the compensation needs to be for the amount of work that is given.

Overall good company to work for.
A typical day in the branch involved mainly assisting customers with customers's financial needs and the tellers with processing questions or handling customer complaints In my time with the company I learned a lot about managing a staff and the balance between my own responsibilities and theirs I am very much a people person and found the importance of understanding your employees on a personal level and not just professional to be great I specialized in Audit preparation and getting the staff and branch ready for an annual internal audit I most enjoyed helping the staff overcome obstacles and helping the staff understand how to do it in the future on the staff's own.
I received a lot of personal fulfillment watching the staff grow and move on to higher positions whether the staff be with the bank or outside of the company.
"Great company to work for.. Like most banks the environment is sales driven, but if you can handle that, then this company is great."
Your goals are set clearly for you and your team so there is no confusion and it's very easy to get in contact with higher-ups if you ever needed to contact higher-ups.
N/a.
My day consists of taking inbound phone calls about customers bank accounts.
While on inbound phone calls about customers bank accounts I must find something to sell the customer or attempt to sell what the system prompts me to sell.

I love the environment I'm in at this bank because I feel comfortable and clients really enjoy coming in and talking with this bank.
The hardest part for me is getting referrals in for this bank's products.

"On a typical day at work, as a teller, will be processing customer's transactions, resolving customer issues and requests, and anything you cannot resolve you escalate it to the platform representatives."

this bank is a good company to work for..
I worked in the Lyndhurst Branch.
Management and employees were both knowledgeable and helpful.
this bank has a wonderful culture of caring for both employees and customers.
I looked forward to going to work daily because of my co-workers and clients.
"The people in my branch worked very well together, a great TEAM."
I worked here and it was extremely disappointing!!!.
"First of all, the hours I was hired to work was not what I was given once I started."
"Also, the teller supervisor either ignored my questions or pretended not to hear me or was annoyed when I asked for help."
It was very confusing due to the fact that everyone that worked here had a different way of doing the job therefore I never understood what was correct and what was not.
Don't work here.
Productive and Team Oriented Enviornment.
"Some of my daily responsibilities include providing information to help internal service partners with regulatory, system, product and policy disputes related to retirement accounts."
"Train peers on department procedures, IRS regulations, legal documentation requirements, products, features, benefits, software, and information systems."
"Also, organize and prepare original documents for retention and storage and fulfilling document requests as well as quality controlling documents for completeness."
Terrible Management.
The management would implement goals that were unrealistic due to ALWAYS being short staffed!
"Once, we surpassed our goal for checking accounts causing the region to exceed the region's goal and the regional manager said since it was student accounts it would not be profitable accounts; instead of praising us for our hard work!"
this bank as a company looks at each employee as a number.
You are not a valued person and even when you go over and beyond sacrificing time with your family it will not be recognized or even appreciated.
"this bank as a company does initially make you think your opinion counts due to employee surveys, but if you don't give your branch or manager good scores you are punished."
If you are thinking about working with this bank as a company DON'T!
You will be happier somewhere else!!
awesome motivational workplace.
manangers always checked on me to make sure I was comfortable in my job abilities and had everything I need to be successful
Management is more concerned with quanity rather than quality.
"Compensation is better than other jobs I have had, however Management does not clearly communicate expectations nor do Management seem concerned about employees."
this bank.
I worked in a lockbox at this bank.
We had several daily deadlines that we tried to meet with proficiency and accuracy.
I learned to see how the way I did my job affected the rest of my department.
My co workers were efficient and I developed some valuable friendships while I worked for this bank which I will have the rest of my life.
Hardest part of my job was when management would not allow me to stay past my shift to help the other shifts.
"I know that there was a budget to be watched, but I thought getting work processed was more important because it effected the customers' finances."
Most enjoyable part of my job was completing my work and helping the other shifts keep up with the other shifts's work.
What did I think of management?
"I realize the office manager had to do what the corporate managers told the office manager to do, but I believe corporate was too concerned with this bank's profits and not enough about meeting the customer's needs."
"They seem to have forgotten that if enough customers got disgusted and left this bank, this bank would start losing business and this bank's profits would go down."
Learning/Growing and Engagement.
Everyday we have the opportunities to learn and grow our own career path.
One of the main goals that we look to accomplish is to create engagement with our employees which makes for a better working environment.
Able to Move up.
A great place to learn and grow as an employee as well as a person.
Terrible management.
Management did not finish the jobs assigned to Management.
Then the whole branch suffers.
Unrealistic goals.
High stress low pay.
Great coaching and support.  
this bank is a great company to work for.
this bank's commitment to coaching and training is truly outstanding!
I loved working in different areas of the branch and being utilized anywhere I was needed.
"You truly have to have a passion for customer service when working there, and of course like any other banking position, thick skin because you are working with this bank's customers money."
"You need to be able to say NO or tell our customers why our customers's account is over drawn, or say why our customers's loan was not approved."
"this bank is known for being the most conservative banks around, but I was a very proud member of this bank and will always be thankful for my time there!"
"I learned a great deal, and had an awesome experience."
"Banking is fun, and Banking's all about the kinds of conversations you have with the customers to uncover the customers's needs."
Great place to work at just low pay.
"I love working for this bank, just wish the pay rate was better."
Much lower when compared to other retail banks.
good company.
took inbound calls to enroll customer in annually benefits for different companys.
Worst mortgage position I've ever had.
"Unfortunately, there is little positive I have to say about my experience as a Sr. Loan Officer at this bank Mortgage."
"Getting loans processed, underwritten and closed in a timely manner did not seem to be high on the priority list at this bank Mortgage."
Processors would not respond to voice mails and emails for days.
Clients were left hanging with no information about the status of loans.
Loans did not close on time.
"There's more, but suffice it to say that I would not recommend working at this bank Mortgage for anyone who wants to be in the mortgage business long term (keeping commitments is a primary job for longevity as a loan officer and the support at this bank Mortgage was almost non-existent)."
Great place to work.
Assisted customers with financial transactions.
"While at this bank, I learned many different things about the financial realm."
The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.
The most enjoyable part of the job was developing relationships with customers and coworkers

Customer focused.
"Work with great people, Believe that if the customer has a great experence that will lead to more of the customer's business."
"Great work life balanc hard part is apologizing for something you did not do, I understand that employees represent the company."
It's not as good as people say in Pittsburgh.
Very challenging sales goals with a very stubborn way to approach clients.
You not only compete against other banks for the business but also have to fight Internally to be competitive Very challenging to get things done.
Worst Job Ever.
"By far the worst bank I have ever worked for, and the worst job I have ever had."
The management in the southeast is ignorant to the market place and The management in the southeast are way under qualified for The management in the southeast's positions.
The emphasis on checking accounts is pathetic and The management in the southeast do not provide incentives for the amount The management in the southeast stress incentives.
"If you want to go to Wal-Mart to beg people for checking accounts, Wal-Mart is your place."
"Otherwise, work somewhere else."
The only reason I worked here as long as I did was because of the people I worked with.
We all hated our jobs together.

Willing to displace employees for anything.
No job security.
Excellent place to learn about the banking industry.
Typical day is speaking with customers about customers's banking needs.
Excellent training and support.
Aggressive Sales and Relationship Management.  
this bank to me is the best bank to work for in the banking industry.
"Over the course of the past decade, sales has becoming more and more aggressive to interest and convince clients that clients's bank is the best."
"At this bank, you are the best because this bank tailor a conversation specific to get information form the client and have the client talk about the client."
"As a Relationship Manager, this bank use what the client told this bank and fit them into the correct products and solutions."
this bank is aggressive but in a different way as this bank show this bank care for the relationship over just the sale.
"just the sale means that person will get that person's Credit Card, Home Equity, Mortgage, Car loans from a different bank rather from the person from this bank who is already discussing this with the clients."
A highly recommended company to work and gain experience in the banking industry.
Diverse and dynamic working environment for a developing financial company.  
this bank is a robust and advancing competitor in the finance industry.
this bank was recognized as an employee-centric company by many standards.
"However, actual workers there may believe otherwise."
"This fast-paced, demanding job may exhaust your quality of life (which is a key component of this bank's core values)."
The benefits package appears to be substantial on paper until The benefits package're necessarily utilized.
"Yet, an assitance program with average resources can mainly rectify and ameliorate some of these issues."
"Overall, this bank's compensation alongside requirements is not commensurable, though with the dynamic managing personnel any individual will flourish."
Productive work place.
I was a Financial Sales Consultant typical day would handling customers on platform side of the branch.

This would make many clients happy and that would make me feel good about myself.
I enjoy assisting people with many clients's needs.
My co-workers and myself got along and that make us work well as a team.
Manager was a bully!.
My last manager was a bully who threatened your job on a daily basis.
"My last manager would tell you one thing one day and tell you the opposite thing the next, then tell you that you are stupid."
My last manager would approve things and when things came back -accuse you of forging My last manager's signature.
CRAZY
Conservative Banking.
Bank has a very consevative approach that demographically does not work for everyone.
Extreme cash handling job.
Monday- Thursday is basically slow.
Tellers handle all customer needs at the window and refer additional services to customer service reps.
Fridays and Saturdays are very busy.
The hardest part of the job was managing long lines at some branches due to few tellers on staff.
The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know regular customers and helping serve regular customers's financial needs.
Great place to work in the POCONOS.
Loved working in the north east from the DM to co workers everyone is like family!!!

Upper management has little to no clue..
"Pros- Coworkers, work/life balance, hours Cons- Low pay, recruiters tell you inflated numbers about what current bankers are making in commission (You will find out very quickly that many bankers never reach there incentive bonus."
I found out during a sales meeting within the first week; going over the 'top' bankers revenue credits which are never enough to make incentive).
Good company.

We needed to provide a 'go-getter' attitude.
Management was actively involved in ways to improve the achievement of our daily goals.
The hardest part of the job was finding new and innovative ways to gain business.
Banking is very competitive these days.
The most enjoyable part was building relationships with my customers and improving my customers's financial well-being.

Another big part of a Teller Supervisor's job is to manage the branch cash and keeping the branch cash in line with guidelines.
It was was wonderful place to work but only part time..

Fast paced environment.
"A typical day of work starts with me logging into all necessary programs, then checking my daily emails."
I take inbound calls that have pretty much anything to do with banking products.
"I also sell banking products so I take applications for loans, checking, savings, etc."
I also make outbound calls to customers to see if customers's is anything this bank can do to make customers's banking experience better.

My sole supervisor is who I report too.
My co-workers are great to be around My co-workers help make the job less stressful.
I would say the worst part of the job is to hear people yell at you all day long for stuff that isn't your fault.

My branch stays short handed
and I see why.

HORRIFIC in Birmingham Alabama.
DO NOT go to work for this bank in Birmingham Alabama in particular the Birmingham West Region it is the most unethical and horrific work environment I've EVER worked for in my 10+years in bank management.
"The Regional Manager for B'ham West is beyond horrible and is why you will CONSTANTLY see positions open in the Birmingham Alabama/Tuscaloosa area, there is always approx."
20%-30% vacancy in positions in the Birmingham West Region because of The Regional Manager for B'ham West and the unethical manner The Regional Manager for B'ham West will force upon employees to manipulate employees's sales results.
"DO NOT GO WORK FOR this bank in Birmingham, Alabama....DON'T DO IT!!!"
B'ham West is a great company but the Birmingham Alabama market operates under B'ham West's on rules that are wrong.
Great work/Life balance..
I feel that no matter what the difficulty or issue is outside of work they make time for you to balance the difficulty or issue.
Co-workers will work with you and it makes the job a lot less stressful knowing what is expected of you coming in and that goals are set to obtain and thrive.

Don't believe the hype.
The company typically don't promote from within.
I worked in one of The company's newer markets and The company treated the people that were acquired from the other banks like the people that were acquired from the other banks were dirt.
"The people The company hired in from the other banks, though, were the golden ones until The company wanted to get rid of the people that were acquired from the other banks."
There are good people that work there but good people that work there are in the branches.
The people at regional level and above are horrible.
My regional manager would berate managers on conference calls while others listened in.
The hardest part of the job was working for someone who treated people this way.
The best part was the people in the branch.
The expectations are unreal and when you aren't hitting goal The company beat you up but when you exceed goal there is no recognition.
The company is a joke.
Forward thinking company; ideal positioning for building a career in finance.
My work day typically involves financial reporting and analysis related to my line of business within the bank.
This involves database research as well as regular and open commnications with colleagues and segment partners.

Growing Bank in The Atlanta Area.
"Powerful Bank that has a lot of potential in The Atlanta Area, but needs to be more selective with the choosing of their executive leadership in the market."
Upper management is not as competent in b2b sales process needed for a new market
Stable job but not a career.
Overall a decent place to work.
I am speaking from a corporate function side and do notice a difference between corporate and line of business specific cultures.
Good luck trying to advance in this bank and if you do decide to take an opportunity to work here - make sure you negotiate all you can up front cause annual increases are in the 2-3% range and the bonus plan is horrible.
All the compensation stays at the top in this bank and there is no motivation to do anymore than the bare minimum required by your role.
There is an upside as if you are at the end of your career or need a 9-5 job that does not require much after-hours focus due to personal/family obligations.
That said - if you are mid career - this bank is not the place for you as you will be held back from a development perspective.

The people make the company.
Great Culture..

The culture of this bank is what makes day to day success not just a possibility but a reality.

Strong Regional Bank that sold it's mortgage co. to Washington Mutual.
I enjoyed working for Strong Regional Bank that sold it's mortgage co. to Washington Mutual.
It was my first mortgage job with a bank.
I began as a community mortgage loan officer and was later promoted to a private banking mortgage advisor.
Good work experience.
"Although this bank's not one of the safest places to work, this bank can be a good place to work."
I believe the pay for tellers could improve and they should also invest in security.
great work life balance.  
this bank is a great company that provides a nice stress free environment that promotes a wonderful work life balance.
I do worry that the sales expectations in order to compete with other financial institutions are balooning to a point where the current employees will no longer value the current employees's employment at this bank.
I would like a job where I can utilize my experience in an office setting and not be held accountable for 'selling' products and services to clients who do not want or need products and services.
Management is horrible.
"Nice place to work for, but when this bank started to close branches and convert two branches into one is terrible..."
"I had the best manager and teller supervisor anyone could ask for, the best manager and teller supervisor anyone could ask for taught me everything to advance in my career..."
When the one branch closed and converted to this bank's branch my Manager and Teller Supervisor was let go and that's when everything fell apart...
this bank's branch was always a 5 star and now our branch are a 3 star branch.
this bank's new Manager and Teller Supervisor have no clue how to handle a bigger branch bc the best manager and teller supervisor anyone could ask for came from a small branch that was very slow and little staff.
"this bank's branch is now very unorganized and no communication within our branch, bc this bank's Manager doesn't like to ask for help nor this bank's Teller Supervisor."
My new Manager also took away all of my privileges I had and is making sure I don't advance bc Our new Manager is not willing to let me do anything as I use too.
Good Work Atmosphere got along great with coworker.
The relationship with my coworkers are amazing.
We get along very well and have a bond that I have never had at a previous job.
"We laugh and have a good time, the pay could be better."
Good Luck.
Worked in the Detroit Region.
Regional micro managed.

Enjoyed my time working there.
The benefits were decent and so was the pay for a teller position.
Answering customer questions.
"Responsible for client contact, financial analysis, and financial product sales, customer service and interfacing with other departments of the bank."
Got to work from home.  
this bank was a nice employer to work for.
When the opportunity came up for a work from home team I was selected for a work from home team.
a work from home team was a great opportunity.
I would still be working for this bank if this bank had not closed the call center I was working in.
Commercial Lender.
Good pay and benefits as long as goals were met.
Hours good - nice work environment.

Most enjoyable part of the job in interacting with customers and providing excellent service to help assist customers in meeting customers's financial goals.

Stressful Job.
"I worked here for a couple months, I loved my job because of my customers, and security."
I really dislike the management.
It's very hard to do anything at my job without the right person to say something or directing you in a wrong way.
discrimintory.
"I used to work for this place many years ago and was let go for something that everyone does, emailing your co workers."
"I recently applied again, thinking that if this place could see how much more experience I have and how I have matured in areas that would benefit this place, this place might consider hiring me again."
"I passed the phone interview and went to a group interview, all in the same day."
"Compared to the other applicants, there were at least 10, I had more than enough experience and qualifications for the position of an entry level call center position."
I was the decision a position with the generic explanation that I did not fit this place's needs.
I'm not sure how that could be when I have over ten years experience.
"I was actually ok with the decision as I would not want to work the hours this place suggested, which was 10-7 and EVERY Saturday."
"this place make it sound like you are eligible to change the hours they suggested, which was 10-7 and EVERY Saturday after you've worked there, but we all know how that will most likely work out."
"Favoritism, I'm sure is how this place run this place."
"The other thing that people need to be aware of is downsizing, that occurs often and employee over turn."
Why do this place have so many positions open?
Because this place can't keep this place's employees.
Only bank still growing.
Marketing is devoted to growing in a new market.
Working with an outside marketing firm to ensure positive growth for each branch helps to increase market presence.
Great for growth and advancement.
Work is non-stop customer service.

The hardest part of the job is telling a customer NO.
The most enjoyable part of my is a happy customer.

"I was a floater so I worked in many different branches, but every branch from Dover to Middletown management was great."
The customers had to warm up to me but after that I had no problems.
There really wasn't a hard part to this job.
The enjoyable part was counting money and the customers.
this bank.  
"this bank is a good company to work for, however like anything that you do there are going to be imperfections."
Be careful and ensure that detail is top of the list when it comes to your work.
OK if you are just starting out..
Management is fine.
this bank makes managers VP's however managers have no say over raises or what managers's direct reports make.
Typical corporation stuff.
this bank hire you for under $10/hr and dangle the carrot...'I've had people make x amount...'
or 'so and so got promoted to...'
Co-workers were nice.
Customer base is generally dissatisfied w/ this bank.
Interest rates paid are dreadfully low.
As a teller you refer people more and more to the ATM's which is in effect making tellers obsolete.
Which is what this bank wants.
More machines and less employees to pay benefits to.
Many employees have 2nd jobs because this bank is not enough by this bank.
Productive Place.
Good place to work in it is a very happy environment.
Employees are very out going and care about you.
Employees are always smiling and ready to help service you

Productive and fast-paced environment with strict attention to detail.
A typical day at work begins with reviewing credit approvals for new and existing accounts to determine whether or not real estate is being taken as collateral.
Reviewing the details of a credit approval is necessary since not all accounts and terms therein are the same.
"Once it is determined that real estate will be taken as collateral, then we follow certain guidelines to determine whether or not real estate is located in a flood zone."
"If real estate is in a flood zone, then we are required by the Federal Regulators to perform what is called flood due diligence to ensure proper flood insurance is in place before a loan can close on an account."
My group is rather small within a larger operations group.
There are about three (3) of us along with our direct manager.
We work well together and learn from one another in order to get the job done.
"Performing flood due diligence can be difficult at times, depending on how many properties are located in flood zones."
"Every account brings Every account's own 'personality' if you will, to the table."
Some are very simple and some require more attention.
"All in all, it is very interesting work"
and I learn something new everyday that keeps me on my toes.
"Aside from flood due diligence, I am also in charge of six (6) regions whereby I work closely with the relationship managers and the attorneys on different accounts to resolve legal exceptions."
Legal exceptions are created after closing documents are received and reviewed to ascertain what is missing from the loan documents or if any deficiencies exist within the loan documents.

The only thing I dislike about my job is sometimes dealing with unruly customers.
Great Place To Work..
Underwriting Foreclosed For Fannie Mae.
With a pipeline of 220 loan a month.
Good Company with customer oriented business plan..
The management in the mortgage division is not on par with the bank the bank itself.
the mortgage division is still trying to develop an identity and constantly is reinventing the processes which creates the disorganization that follows new implementation.
The mid level management has no origination experience and so does not fuilly understand origination outside of the bank referrals.
Good people with good intentions.
I hope they get it right.
It was an enjoyable job until the consolidation.
I worked with a great group of women until the two branches in our town the consolidation then every thing we were told was not the truth and I lost my confidence in my future with the bank
Was a great place to work when it was NCM.
Great place to work when Company was owned by NCM but when this bank took over it all changed.
worst employer ever.
"rude management, very unprofessional staff."
no one knew there job responsibilities at all.

Productive and Sales Driven.
"A typical day at work entails completing teller transactions, communicating with clients to drive loans, credit cards, investment and business referrals, and checking accounts."
"I've learned a lot about mortgages, investments, and business, while enhancing my communication, analytical, and organization skills."
Management is great and most definitely makes employee growth a priority.
Co-workers are very team oriented and productive.
The hardest part of the job is finding new solutions to drive customer interaction and participation.
The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers to find a solution to customers's questions and concerns.
Teller Station All Day.
"Diposit checks, cash checks, withdrawal money from diferent accounts, referrals, cashiers checks, money orders."
Work with money all day.
Great fostering of teamwork.
I was able to interact face to face with customers experiencing hardships and assist customers experiencing hardships in anyway possible to remain in customers experiencing hardships's home.
This was also one of the hardest aspects of my work because you become involve with people going through one of the hardest phases of people going through one of the hardest phases of their lives's lives.
I worked remotely from home and traveled weekly in order to attend different events set up by government agencies and non-profits organizations as well.
I attended both contested and non-contested trials as a witness in behalf of the bank in order to prove ultimate ownership of the note/property once in default.
"I had the pleasure of being part of an eight person team, while only three of an eight person team participated in the default work; we an eight person team got along and could count on each other as necessary."
I learned to be a better listener and understand that a little compassion and empathy goes a long way.
Excellent work environment.
This is my review for the company this bank that I work for.
"A typical day includes driving to work, working, then driving home."
Overall Good Company to Work For.

good people to work wtih.
procuctive and fun place to work for.
The expericence working at this bank is great and friendly atmostere.
customer are friendly
Favoritism run rampid.

Great learning experience.
Great learning experience.
"Quick time frames, fast paced and full of technical challenges."
Do Not Work as a Branch Financial Sales Rep for this bank!!.
The only good thing I have to say about this bank is that this bank are a good place to gain entry level experience in banking.
Once you get your experience though get the heck out!
"this bank's training is horrendous, all this bank care about are SALES #'s."
"this bank didn't care that I had a customer service score of 4.98/5.00 (yes, Gallup the company that conducts polling will randomly call your customers to ascertain satisfaction.)"
All I heard after carrying such a high service score was I was doing a bad job and all this other BS just because my sales numbers were middle of the pack.
"My biggest gripe with this bank is the pay, the pay is PATHETIC!!!."
My annual raise was .15 cents an hour.
"I started making 11.50 / hr, after my 'Big' promotion I was making 12.50 /hr."
The majority of the customers that you will see on a given day will be very escalated due to poor company training and no accountability.
So your day basically consists of putting out fires other people started.
Customer Service incentives were easy to hit however the sales goals were nearly impossible.
Management wants you to be a robot for this bank and never question processes that are made by people who haven't been in a retail branch in 10 years.
"All in all, It is not worth it unless you are an entry level candidate looking to gain experience."
24k base pay for a lot of headaches.
Productive and fun work place..

this bank in a Glance.
A typical day at this bank consisted of meeting with clients both current and new.
"It also consisted of conducting cold calls to clients to offer products/services, which clients was not already utilizing."
The management structure was by far complicated.
There were many managers over me and The management structure generally created conflicting sides based on the information received by the employee The co-workers were most of the time willing to help.
this bank tried to implement a 'team environment' and in most cases was able to achieve this.
The hardest part of the job was the downtime.
"I am a person who likes to stay busy, and there was too much downtime somedays."
The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting clients and helping clients financially the best way possible.
It made me happy when my clients were satisfied with the services I had provided.
The worst bank Ive worked for yet!!!.
I've had a great career in banking with the exception of this bank.
"No platform training, poor management and be prepare to use a script that has a pass or fail model that might cost you your job."
this bank is definitely not a company I would recommend anyone to.
The people I worked with were under-paid and over-worked.
The RM seems like a great position but trust me The RM isn't the dream job this bank sold me.
BEWARE!!!
Productive and fun working place.
Very nice place where you not only help people but everyone is willing to help you.

great job good benefits.
I liked this job because this job was an overnight job.
check processing sorting were the duties
Good Company.
Good company to work for.
Left because I was searching for a better opportunity closer to home
Constant Stress bad Management.
The worst part of the job was worrying about getting fired for the small small things.
If it's even a problem in the system always blame it on the employs.
Poor training and direction.
I was hired to manage a team of outside sales associates.
a team of outside sales associates were given three days of training and told to secure 100 checking accounts a month for a company that has less the 1 percent market share in Orlando.
Unrealistic goals and expectations combined with poor training and guidance didn't make for a good experience.
Temporary assignment.
I was working here as a temp until the department closed down.
A typical day would include processing the current days transactions from all the area branches.
"Very sterile, impersonal environment."
I was a remote Underwriter working from home.
I had very little underwriting support or tech support.
Superior/Unique oral and written communication skills and the ability to maintain a cooperative spirit from individuals and groups.

Excellent place to work with great people.
I truly enjoy working where I work now.

Great Platform for Training and Development.
I managed 30-40 employees every quarter with quality call monitors.
I learned an extensive of amount of knowledge regarding and paying attention to details.
I was selected to head up the Gallup surveys and hold refresher courses for new training.
The hardest part of my job was dealing with the inconsistencies of information from one department to another.
The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting and teaching the people I managed.
such an unhappy place to work.
"Management at branch and regional level are so inundated with conference calls, emails and busy work from upper level management that it breeds an environment of uptight, frightened branch managers."
"Of course, this trickles down to tellers and desk help This is just a sort of amusing observation... each Oct or so this bank would receive several boxes of this bank calendars to give to this bank's customers."
The last 3 years i was employed with this bank this bank would get a large interoffice envelope in early december with one of this bank calendars in a large interoffice envelope wishing this bank a joyous holiday season.
This was this bank's Christmas gift from this bank.

this bank.  
this bank has been a great company to work for.
The culture makes for a very pleasant work day.
Great Potential.
"I think that this bank-Investments is fine overall and will be a great place to be in several years, but unfortunately at the moment this bank-Investments is still a bank in transition due to RBC being acquired by this bank-Investments."
I enjoy my job and meeting with clients but the reality is that RBC only has 2 percent of the regional market share and to further complicate things RBC didn't have a sales culture and there have been significant hurdles trying to implement one.
Typical day at work.
A typical day at work starts out with a quick start where we share a positive tip or idea for the day.
"I then make follow up phone calls, running transaction when needed, and pull reports for the monthly file."
I have learned to manage a teller line by coaching to ensure the tellers reach the tellers's personal goals to help improve the banks over all sales.
With managing I have also learned how to understand co-workers personalities and how to approach co-workers the right way to get the task done right the first time.
The hardest part of my job is making cold calls for sales opportunities.
"I would much rather pitch a product that I believe would truly help my clients financial well-being, rather than just pushing any product."
"The most enjoyable part of being a teller supervisor is being able to help my clients with my clients's financial troubles, and I also enjoy managing the cash on hand at the branch to ensure we have great customer service."

I have to say the MOST enjoyable part of my job is going to work to wait on my customers and being with my this bank Family.
I really don't think I have ever had a hard part of my job.
I enjoy my job so much.
Normally relaxed work place with an occasional spike in the amount of work that is required..
The branch I currently work at is normally pretty relaxed.
"The only problems are with the customers who can be needy, overbearing and to be quite honest, pretty stupid because the customers who can be needy, overbearing and to be quite honest, pretty stupid are grown men and women who do not want to learn how to do things for the customers who can be needy, overbearing and to be quite honest, pretty stupid."
"Frustrating can be an understatement at times, but like i said, that is only like once a month because we have certain busy days."
"My co-workers are great, the management is very helpful and is always willing to teach."
Was a nice place to work for.
"My head teller was very nice, If you had any questions My head teller was very helpful in assisting you, Got to know people who were regular customers and establish a relationship with people who were regular customers."
Most people who came the the bank were very nice.
All my co-workers were nice.
The end of the day was kind of stressful when it came time to count your drawer and make sure your drawer balanced.
Enjoying sightseeing.
"A typical day at work, show up with uniform and on time, on the other hand your day would start wrong and all your stops would be late."
I learned to drive a bigger vehicle than what I have and different routes such as different places in New Jersey.
Management was ok and co-workers the same.
The hardest part of the job was when I was locked in between two steel doors for more than a hour and not being able to come out until someone would come or answer the walkie talkie.
The most enjoyable part of the job was when you would show up at your destination and someone from the bank would need you to translate.
Full time bank teller.

Very educational environment to work in.

I am not happy at this bank because there are no advancement and no full time opportunities.
The management are not helpful and cooperative

"this bank a great banking family, who endorsed balance and family."
Heavy quality interaction with the clients and potential future clients thru this bank conversation.

"I learned that this bank cares about this bank's clients and offers a grow up great program for children, to be fast and efficient, how to set a good example by my actions, to strive for achievement and to exceed all customer needs."
Management in most branches cared about Management in most branches's employees and recognized their employees talents and ambition to succeed and helped in advancement.
Co-workers work together as a team in down time offer to help other team members
so no one falls behind during busy branch hours.
The hardest part of the job is when other team members call out.
"the most enjoyable part of the job, looking forward to greeting bank clients, protecting and serving client needs, satisfying client concerns,"
Productive and a great working environment.
"A typical day at work is to come in continue working on files, gathering documents and closing loans."
good company.
I enjoyed most of my employment with this bank but I reached a time where I felt like I wouldn't move up any further so it was time for me to move on
No room for advancement.
"regional management is poor, and ruins the experience foe the branches."
Too much micromanagement.
No room to advance to another division of the bank unless you live in pittsburgh.
Not the caring company they proclaim to be..
Was not the company they claimed to be.
They said they would take care of their employees first because their employees need to be taken care of so that our customer's can be taken care of.
"When my work performance started to decline, they never once asked me what was the cause."
They just let me go.
Great place to work.
the company is a great company with great benefits.
"The bank is one of the most stable, well funded banks in the industry."

Great Place to work..
"Great Experience for Leadership Development, Coaching and Development."
Provide on going classroom training for enrichment.
Great Managers who loved working together and coming up with ideas for employee engagement and customer engagement.
Loan Officers Not Respected.  
"this bank has a great reputation for Financial Services and Banking, mortgages, not so much."
"In Southern California, this bank are known for causing problems for Short Sellers and Short Sellers's realtors, by holding out for more money in a 2nd lien position, and settling with regulators for large amounts of money for mortgage related infractions."
But this is all stuff that you're able to overcome with strong relationships.
What you can't overcome is upper management's refusal to hire more fulfillment staff.
"LO's's make too much money anyway, right?"
LO's can also process LO's's own loans.
Recently LO's unveiled a new fulfillment process that would set everything strait.
Basically a new fulfillment process that would set everything strait amounted to the LO submitting a loan package that had everything short of transcripts.
a loan package that had everything short of transcripts is a 90+ point check list of documents needed to get your file to underwriting.
"The files went straight to UW, the processors didn't get involved until later."
I still don't quite understand what the few processors LO's do have actually do.
"LO's didn't pull together outstanding paperwork, collect info to satisfy conditions, or anything you would expect a processor to do."
"That being said, there were a few goods ones I enjoyed working with except it was rare that a few goods ones I enjoyed working with would be assigned to my files, the good processors were assigned to the LOs who submitted incomplete files....."
The corporate side of this bank is horrible.
"The culture you find when dealing with HR, Payroll, etc. is a finger pointing, 'That's not my job', can't do attitude."
"Management in general has an extremely arrogant attitude, Management in general truly believe - more..."
Great company.
Great employees and leadership team.
Growing company with strong performance.
Had enjoyed my employment with them.
"Opening the bank ,lobby management and greeting every client and thanking every client when every client where leaving for banking with us."
Would interact with clients with sales and service issues.
Also continued education on bank product and services and bank regulations as well as cash audits.
The best part of my job was helping clients attain clients's financial goals.
Achieving a common goal within a teamwork environment.
Every day was different dealing with different customers I learned how to deal with different personalities.
I have a very good relationship with my managers.
"my managers have taught me many things...how to do reports, improve my customer service skills My coworkers are very professional and there is a sense of team work."
Hardest part of the job was the selling aspect.
Most enjoyable is the customer and really making the customer feel special
New task.
"This was a new experience for me, I have a lot of good co-workers, I took a lot of responsibilities."
Mortgage Loans.
this company's was my first exposure tot he financial market and this company's offered tremendous training both on the products and on sales.

Emphasis on work/life balance.
Got laid off due to outsourceing.
I worked as a Quality Assurance Specialist/Surveyer and I enjoyed my job however my office closed due to outsourcing.
Analyzing documents pertaining to obtain a home mortgage/refinance.
The position was very routine - try was no contact with borrower.
All documents were reviewed for accuracy and routed to underwritin for further review - to be approved or denied The position was created in 2012 as a seamless way to have borrowers documents delivered in a timely fashion with hopes of increasing time of application to close.
this bank truly appreciates this bank's employees.
"this bank is a great Co. to work for.. With my job, there is not enough time to accurately do your best."
"In the branch I work, Pressure to hit sales goals is extremely high."
Very happy while working there.
"I was a Remote Underwriter of Conventional, HARP, USDA and Portfolio Mortgages."
"I was considered part-time however I never worked less than 30 hours per week and as business increased, I worked many more hours."
My manager was excellent.
Job Insecurity.
I worked in the mortgage department.
It's either feast or famine and it was famine for me.
The laid me and 59 other people off.
Management consists of many different styles but my manager micromanaged so much so that I suffered in advancement.
Productive Fun place to work.

"My day starts out with getting my drawer, and signing onto my computer, making sure that I am stocked with cash, and other essentials that is needed to run a smooth shift, then we have our team meeting, which is sometimes fun, but mostly informative, then our doors open up to our customers."
"I have found that everyday is a learning experience at my job, for one we have courses that we take, and just customer interaction, you never know what a customer needs, would like you to do, or find out for a customer."
"I enjoy my co-workers we work as a family instead of a team, we help one another, we can also make the day go by fast just for the little things that we do to encourage the other person."
"The hardest thing about my job I think is when you work for a big branch, you lose some of the personal connection with your customers, and sometimes that is difficult, most customers want that personal one on one, and in my position as a teller you have to look at everything and sometimes not that you want that but it gets lost because you are trying to help and get your customers in and out in a reasonable time."
"The most enjoyable is when my customer have a problem and you have helped my customer and the look on my customer's faces have that relieve smile, and you hear thank you, to me helping my customers is so important, and making sure that my customers's needs are met me a lot."
Great bank to work for; had good bankig products such as the virtual wallet checking account.
My personal experience does not represent overall bank overlook but the branch I worked at was under-staffed and had a high-volume foot traffic that was clearly unmatched for the skeletal staff provided.
"I also believe, the branch manager had numerous emblematic flaws from poor communication, to work load distribution, and overall staffing to meet demand."
Pretty good over all.
A life in the banking world.
I made a career change and decided to change job paths Everything was managed well overall.
Productive and Professional Work place.
.A
typical day consisted of field marketing outreach for this bank.
"We utilized different outreach strategies such as residential blitzing, hand to hand marketing, and business blitzing."

Hardest part of the job would be dealing with clients who had a bad customer service experience and try helping clients who had a bad customer service experience come to a solution to clients who had a bad customer service experience's problem or frustraion.

It's a bank they are all the same.
"Normal bank job, All you have to know is basic Policy and Procedures."
Upper Management has unrealistic goals.
All but one of my co-workers are great the one I do work with doesn't want me there and proves it to me every day I go to work.
The hardest part of my job is seeing one of my co-workers everyday.
The most enjoyable is when one of my co-workers is no there.

Everyone from co-workers to management is approachable and willing to help.
A majority of my day is spent on the phone with customers going over customers's account and customers's options to cure the default.
"However my day is broken up with team meetings, web based trainings and team building activities."

Wealth Management.
I develop business internally by maintaining and expanding strong relationships with line of business partners.
I've learned that Wealth Management functions differently from the head quarters and is attempting to establish a brand in this market.
Management means well but is still trying to figure it all out.
"My co-workers are a mixed bag, as in most office environments but everyone must have a business development mind set."
The hardest part of my job is making sure everyone can see the forest through the trees and developing Wealth Management's brand.
The most enjoyable part is when you see the information click for someone.
Great company Great company know how to choose Great company's employees.
I enjoyed my position and my co-workers were awesome.
"Great company has great values, however, you have to make sure you are on good terms which your regional manager."
If not Great company will have it out for you.
great workplace.
answering incoming and outgoing call breaking down equipmen troubleshooting calls
demanding job with lots of responsibilities..
What i have learned is that we are disposable and technology is replacing us quickly.
Young management doesn't respect the knowledge older workers have.
Working with the public is rewarding.
You'll never be bored.
"You do the same thing, day after day but every day you have different circumstances which vary depending on the customer your waiting on."
"Never a dull moment, always something to be learned."
Once you learn your customers your in like flenn.
this bank.
The first 7 years of employment gave me everything that I needed in an employer.
With the reconstruction the heart has been taken out of this bank.
This has taken away my excitement and interest in my job.
Excellent workplace.
"A typical day at work includes: reviewing daily reports, gathering data to track the progression of our new technology rollout for 14 branches, mentoring new tellers for our region, training staff members on our new banking system, formatting new spreadsheets and distributing new spreadsheets to the rest of our region, monitoring/setting sales goals, keeping files updated and ensuring compliance set by the bank and Loss Prevention sector."
this bank takes pride in strengthening and enriching the communities..
"Working in the corporate sector of this bank, one would assume daily activities are routine since I am not working directly with the public."
That could not be further from the truth.
"I could plan what I am going to do the next day, but one email can take me off track and even take up half of my days work."
I do not mind it though.
I love being busy and learning daily.
That takes me to what I have learned about myself as an individual and an employee.
I am very proactive and take initiative.
I learned that I am one to pass the buck.
"the buck stops with me, if the buck gets to me."
I am not afraid to admit when I am not familiar with anything because I know that the opportunity is there to learn and grow and I am willing to seize the opportunity.
Management has to be approached on a person by person basis.
It all boils down to personalities and how everybody meshes together.
"It is all about setting the expectations, boundaries."
"Based on my observation, management style in general is top down, but may not work for everybody."
My co-workers for the most part are great to work with.
We all are working towards the same goal personally and professionally.
We have adapted this bank's culture.
Those who do not agree with the culture of this bank tend not to last very long with this bank and usually seek employment elsewhere.
The hardest part of the job is working with so many personalities and satisfying everyone.
The most enjoyable part is conquering the hardest part of the job by making The hardest part of the job the easiest part of the job.
"At the end of the day, we are all human-beings are - more..."
Customer Service.  
this bank is a wonderful place to work.
My typical day consisted of traveling to branches throughout the West Essex Region.
Great Management but some drawbacks.
"Depending on the schedule that was always changing based on having a staffing issue, some days I would open the branch but usually i would always close."
My manager was fantastic but my supervisor had communication issues with explaining scheduling conflicts.
My coworkers were a joy to work with and My coworkers really made the transition from one banking atmosphere to another very smooth.
The hardest part of the job was being treated the way i was by my supervisor.
my supervisor acted as if i was completely new to banking instead of acknowledging that i had been doing banking for 7 years.
The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with my coworkers and getting to know the customers so as to gauge the customers's banking needs.
fun place to work.
I worked for this company for a couple of years.
this company helped me get through school and still have me enough time to balance between other things.
Co-workers and management are very nice and helpful.
There is a lot of room to grow.

Banking World.
A typical day at work is interacting with clients and making sure all clients's requests and transactions are met.
"Referrals and sales are a constant part of the day, recognizing opportunity and offering products accordingly I have learned about banking and all the laws and rules that come along with banking The hardest part was learning all the policies and being capable of passing a bank audit with one on one questions on policies The management has taught me what it takes to work as a team player and allow for success."
Most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the clients and all my co-workers.
"An environment in which work was encouraged and fun.. All day interfacing with clients and prospects, selling investments and bank products."
"I opened checking, savings, certificates and mortgages for the bank I sold financial planning and investment products on the securities side of the bank."
Hardest part of the job was defending my clients needs from management insistence that the most profitable for the bank products should be recommended.
The most enjoyable part of the job was in resolvin the issues in my favor.
"Co-workers were bright, resourceful and congenial."
I learned to assist customers and clients in resolving issues and creating satisfaction.
I enjoyed all aspects of my work.
Very disheartening.
I worked at this bank during the collapse of the mortgage industry.
"this bank's objective was not customer satisfaction, but rather Their objective was solely about obtaining TARP money from the federal government by way of aquisition of bank N Bank."
Usual day.
• Assist clients with monthly billing details to increase customer knowledge.
• Aid clients with the best possible solutions to increase customer satisfactio.
• Adjust fees and keep accurate records.
• Monitor client accounts for security breache • Toggle between screens to use banking software and operate phone system for speedy and accurate service
Fun workplace.
"I loved working at the bank, Because I was trusted to handle a large amount of cash."
I learned so many new things from working at the bank.
"I learned how to count money a different way, and also how to handle customers that didn't speak English."
Good working environment with strong leadership..
I worked specifically with the Fast Path team during my time at this bank Mortgage.
the Fast Path team was built to process loans at a faster rate than the current 90 day norm.
I was in charge primarily of updating and verifying the hazard and flood insurance documents for potential loans.
I reached out to insurance companies daily to receive updated documents which helped loans get to processing at a quick rate.
My co-workers and I worked exceptionally hard and had fantastic results as the first group of Fast Path team members.
The hardest part of the position at times was just waiting for the insurance carriers to send over the updated documents.
Often many calls had to be placed to remind the insurance carriers to send the information over.
But overall the position was extremely enjoyable.
Especially on a day when you were able to tell the borrower everything was going smoothly.
Having a good relationship with the borrower really help make it apparent you were helping someone out and made the position very enjoyable.
Very good group to work for.
"Professional, the American express of Branch Banking."
Job has benefits of personal recognition in community and the opportunity for advancement.
"Pay is better than most, but needs to be raised."
Most educational experience I have had.
Changing Bank Envoironment.  
this bank is going through the hard times in banking just like every bank.
"As banking continues to evolve less people are necessary, in order to conduct the banks day to day business."
"Therefore, jobs that in the past were relationship building jobs have become sales jobs pushing widgets."
I believe that the customer still can be helped but as Chase Bank became more sales driven the smaller banks followed suit.
This is a fun place to work.
I really love this Job.
I left only cause I knew I wouldn't want to make this Job a career.
Ok company.
Ok company.
The people are ok.
There are 6 tellers 2 are full time and 4 are part time.
There is never enough help.
The training was easy and the system is easy to use
Hard but okay to work.
"The time I started working at this bank, this bank were merging with the Mercantile Bank which I was working at and I stayed there and was hard and fun."
Great co
#NAME?
Had great and friendly co-workers.
The customers were also very nice and pleasent to work with.
The company focus on sales more than anything else.
The turnover is also horriable.
Absolutely LOVED this job.
this job was a great learning environment with management that genuinley cared acout you as a person and the growth of your career.
"relaxed environment, enjoyable place to work."
I was a part-time teller that eventually went to full-time.
The pay wasn't that great but it was good place to work for a single mom with a small child.
Tellers are a 'dime a dozen.'.
"Highly stressful based on customer interaction, we must adhere to banking rules and often have to repeat the same thing to a customer."
Working with large amounts of cash can be very stressful when out of balance I learned how to sell.
This job was 90% sales 10% banking in terms of cashing checks and making deposits for customers.
"Management was very strict, often would talk on a weekly basis about sales levels and areas of self improvement Co-workers were all fairly young, willing to learn, but most of all, Co-workers needed to sell products as well in order to be recognized."
The hardest part of my job was learning how to be assertive to customers who were shallow.
I've had several instances in which I denied a customer funds from a check because of an expired drivers license and gotten called everything but my name.
I was able to develop a system of which to talk to certain people.
Those who understand finance I can carry on a professional conversation that uses bank terminology to land a sale and Those who understand finance would understand and accept a sale.
Good Guy Bank.  
Good Guy Bank has a strong sense of corporate responsibility and generally treats Good Guy Bank's people fairly.
"Good Guy Bank does suffer from the problem most large banks do, that it is hard to get noticed and move up."

Team player theme with sales and profitability goals..
Interact with customers processing transactions and identifying additional needs to refer to other lines of business.
Pay.  
this bank does NOT like to pay this bank's employees.
Management is unethical and dishonest.
"this bank support PBS children's programming but won't pay this bank's employees, whom most have children (major contradiction)."
"this bank employee underwriters, who are 'untouchable'....underwriters, who are 'untouchable' will not communicate with you and underwriters, who are 'untouchable''s processors have poor communication skills and most of my clients complained about the processors most of my clients were assigned to."
STAY AWAY FROM this bank!!!
"Productive, and fun workplace."
"Good managers, open to suggestions."
"Typical day at work, reviewing reports for new incoming files, updating Loan officers, and market managers on status of files."
Hardest part would be the end of the month.
Most enjoyable is when customers are happy.
Ok.  
this bank is a great place to be if you work in one of the faster branches.
If you find yourself in a slow paced branch you will want to tear out your own hair.
"You'll be lucky to see 5 people a day in a slow paced branch, and still be expected to meet all sales goals (which are you uniform across the this bank market no matter how busy or not busy you are)."
Expected to make 20 cold calls calls a day.
"Good learning experience, but pay is low compared to work."

The most enjoyable part of the job is for everyone you can not please there is at least one who appreciates and respects all that you can do and that makes it all worth it.
Typical Bank.
Sales are all that matter.
Large company where the average employee gets lost and can't really move up anywhere.
Bad hours.
Lots of opportunity.
Overall each day was something new dealing with the public.
I felt secure in knowing that customers entrusted customers's lives with me in handling customers's financial decisions.
My coworkers have made long time friends over time.
Although the job the job itself was hard a times trying to convince customers that there was something better that customers should have.
That's all a part of a sales atmosphere.
Good work place with a strong sense of team work..
"A typical work day there was dedicated towards good and accurate customer service, I spent lots of time handling cash, counting down drawers, greeting customers, cutting money orders and cashiers checks, and preparing mail orders out going and incoming."
Enjoyable work place and employees.

Enjoyed working there but was downsized when the company was bought..
I worked as a Processing Teller for 3 years.

I was completely in charge of a new process from beginning to end.

I had many friends in management and on the processing floor.
"The hardest part of my job is due to my lack of education I struggled with some areas of my job, because I do not have the knowledge in computers that I would like to have."
What I liked about my job is that even though there were certain things I did every day.

"I feel very comfortable being able to approach my supervisor with any concerns, questions and suggestions."
my supervisor're very perceptive of our feedback on improvements for the company.
Did not like management at the time.
Difficult place to work at the time due to management.
Nothing but uncertainty !.  
this bank can be a very good company but the communication between management and employee is not acceptable !
I was hired as a floating teller to cover 4 branches.
Now this bank are trying to send me somewhere far and keep acting like this bank have amnesia when I let this bank know what the issue is.
The pay is also disgraceful.
this bank want all this work but this bank don't want to pay employees what employees are worth.
If you enjoy spur of the moment decisions and horrible pay then this is the job for you.
I'm currently looking for a new job elsewhere because this bank is getting ridiculous.

Unfair practices.
As an employee of this bank I have witnessed many unethical practices and downright crumby treatment of non-management employees.
this bank has little to offer and can and will take that from you as well.
No safety net.
No security.
Great Place to work.
The employee that work for the company is what makes it a good experience.

this bank is a good bank to work for as this bank is mostly commercial business.
Poor Management and Lack of Know-How.
Micro-management!!
I worked for this bank Mortgage for 1 year and that was all I could take.
this bank Mortgage's focus is on the wrong things.
this bank Mortgage are so afraid of doing the wrong thing in this industry that everything is over done to the point that the customers and employees are frustrated with each loan.
"this bank Mortgage hire people from the outside and put people in management positions and this bank Mortgage have no idea what this bank Mortgage are doing, this bank Mortgage have little to no experience in this industry."
"There is no room for advancement, you better like the position that you get hired on for because the position that you get hired on for's where you will stay unless you decide to leave."

"Read some of the other reviews and you'll see, a lot of people saying the same things."
Productive and Fast Paced Environment.  
this bank was a great company to work for.
Your days go by fast and customer interactions as well as co-worker interactions were enjoyable.
The hardest part about the job is learning everything required and doing the job quickly and efficiently.
It all comes with time though.
Productive workplace with lots of face to face customer service.
"A typical day consisted of servicing customers in the lobby, in the drive thru, as well as on the phone."
I learned how to service and deal with all types of customers.
I also learned about banking products and services that the company had.
My co-workers were always enjoyable to work with.
We worked as a team which helped service customers efficiently and smoothly.
The hardest part of the job were those unruly and rude customers.
To me there were more pros then cons.
"The enjoyable part was conversations with customers, helping customers in the long run."
Finding out about what each person needed was always an interesting thing to me.
Also the challenges of getting top customer service scores and meeting sales goals.
Great Customer Service.
This was an excellent company to work for.
I had to leave it for a full time position because none were opening in my area.
"Family friendly, family oriented, overall great company!"
Nice Company.
"I worked at a newer branch a Denovo, fairly beautiful branch, nice location."
Nice company to work for and definitely a great learning experience.
Nice Company began my real journey forward.
this bank is a great place to work.
I have learned several new processes..
A typical day at this bank is working with loan processors and loan processors's managers.
Management is very disorganized.
Very chaotic.
Management has very little knowledge and understanding of how everyday operations work focusing only on Management's ideas without accepting input from the people who are actually meeting with the customers and clients.
Management want to be customer focused but that gets lost somewhere.
I was very disappointed with my experience from day one.
My first day I reported for training but they canceled training without letting me know.
I then had to drive over 100 miles from Akron to Columbus just to fill out new hire paperwork then be enrolled in a class that had already been started.
I was then asked why I didn't know something that had been taught early in a class that had already been started.
I found that was just the beginning of my experience with them and have many more similar examples.
fun and great place to meet a lot of people.  
this bank is a good place to work.
this bank offers great benefits and flexible schedule.
I was able to learn so many thing in just few months.
Bank Teller.
"I was a teller and I completed transactions including deposits, credit card payments, withdrawls, cash advances and other banking functions."
"Unorganized, lack of proper training.."
Overall I was not cut out for mortgage processing.
I do feel as though the lack of training and organization was a factor in my inability to meet the organizations needs.
Great place to work and room for advacing.
It was a great place to work the only reason im still not there is because i moved to pa.
bank.
not a place to work if you enjoy fast paced sales.
the want you to sit in branch all day
Intent to Proceed Mailbox.
My position was called the ITP Mailbox.
I thought I was hired to set up the borrower's's loans; verifying the docs; but I was actually doing the Intent To Proceed forms.
Making sure the loan officers indicated on the Intent To Proceed forms that the borrower's would like to proceed with the loan.
If the borrower's did then it would go to the file prep specialist (loan set up specialists) then from there to the loan processors.
It was very redundant and boring.
I felt like what I was doing was not a challenging position and a waste of time.
Working for the Proof Department..
"On a typical day of work we worked as a team to balance, encode the dollar amounts as well as the banking and account numbers on various types of checks."
We also worked as a team to meet deadlines.
sell sell sell.
"a typical day starts with our manager telling us we need to open more checking accounts, bring in more loans and teaching us how to sound like robots (basically)."
this bank wants you to do things this bank's way instead of having any personality at all.
"you are supposed to greet the customer with 'hello, welcome to this bank."
How may i help the customer'.
"if you say anything else, you will have a conversation with our manager about the 'proper way' to do things."
"Meanwhile, our manager will go back into our manager's office and post things on facebook about how our manager's weekend was."
I would say 75% of my unhappiness with this bank was my direct manager.
it is hard to move up in this bank. .
this bank just want worker bees that blindly follow orders handed down.
Great place to work.
Great career builder Good for young employees ---get the experience for customer service and handling money.
"Good benefits--like health insurance ,etc."
I enjoyed the customer relationships I built during the 8 years I worked for this bank.
The ability to learn new things during my time there was important..
When I first started in the banking industry this bank was more of a town home bank.
"We were bought out by this bank and joined the corporate world, naturally there were a lot of changes and I adapted very quickly."
I had a very good customer following.
I worked well with my co-workers.
One thing in particular that my customers and co-workers would always comment on is the fact I always remembered names.
Quickstart and Goal Setting.
A day at work would always start with a Quick Start.
a Quick Start is a 10-15 minute pep rally.
I would huddle with the team to set individual goals on activities for the day and set the stage.
Motivate the team to reach the team's goals and set the tone of the day I would then meet with my Financial Sales Consultant and talk about how my Financial Sales Consultant's previous day went.
Ask my Financial Sales Consultant's question around what my Financial Sales Consultant felt my Financial Sales Consultant did good and what my Financial Sales Consultant found that may have hinder my Financial Sales Consultant from selling a product or having a complete conversation with a customer.
"I would role play with what hinder my Financial Sales Consultant from having the conversation with the customer, so my Financial Sales Consultant would feel comfortable with the next customer."
my Financial Sales Consultant would set a goal for my Financial Sales Consultant on the activities my Financial Sales Consultant was going to work on for the day.
Then I would end our daily debrief with praising my Financial Sales Consultant on what my Financial Sales Consultant accomplished.
I feel it's always best to end with a positive note.
The hardest part of my job is when I can't provide for my customer.
"For example, when my customer are trying to better my customer and my customer would like to consolidate loans and loans's declined."
I give my customer advice and show my customer how my customer can build my customer's credit.
At the same time I know I did all that I could but the expression on my customer's face is so hard to look at.
"On the other side, when I am able to provide for a customer who is purchasing a customer who is purchasing their first car or home's first car or home and the joy in a customer who is purchasing their first car or home's face is the most enjoyable part of my day."
It also brings me joy when my team succeeds in meeting my team's goal in sales and customer service Gallup survey.
processing claims.
"data entry extreme sitting, process claims medical bills."
working second shift 330p-12am
Rapidly growing .
"good company to work for, high priority on work life balance."
"Fun work environment, neat people and good place to work."
I have worked at this bank for going on 8 years.
I have grown as a person and manager in 8 years.
this bank worked well with my school schedule during college and provided me with a great work/life flexibility.
I even met my fiance while working for this bank.
No Training No Future.
"I will make this as simple as possible, this is not a good company to work for."
No training and no future do not fall for the lies.
Great employees and team players.
"Handling money and balancing cash draw, Helping customers with customers's account information and needs, Handling the ATM,"
"Good hours, lousy management ."
"Horrible training, lousy managers."
"Supervisors who didn't know what they were doing, criticism"
fun work place good place to work at.
My day at work is at most times easy going.
I talk to customers all day long on the phone and handle customers's problems.
I work in a team but as well have my own file that I am responsible for each month.
"Great Company, Experience Varies by Department."
"While this bank is listed as a great place to work by multiple publications, individual experiences will vary by department."
"Some groups allow flexible work arrangements, while others offer very littel work/life balance."
"Additionally, some departments offer very little in way of career development and/or advancement Senior leadership is truly committed to culture and values, making this bank a company with long-term success on the horizon."
Job.
"I worked here for 9 months as payment processor, and data entry but I had to move to another company near to my home."
Exceptional support.
"Training, communicationa and support were beyond expectations during a challenging acqusition."
A solid company with many talented employees whom were a joy to work with.
Attended to the needs of Wealth Management Trust clients through various services.
I enjoyed the close working relationship with clients and being able to help clients.
"I enjoyed my co-workers, my co-workers were all very helpful and kind."
the hardest part of the job was my relationship with the Trust Advisor that I assisted.
The most enjoyable part of the job was the client interaction and the other associates I worked with.
Not much room for advancement the company would rather hire externally.
"Worked here for two years and received an eleven cent raise... what a joke, Was unable to move up in the company twice I applied for a job and was declined due to hiring externally."
Go to Key or Huntington at least you get paid more per hour to do the same thing.
Do not waste your time with a company that does not value a company that does not value their employees time and dedication's employees time and dedication.
Taking the Bank to the Business.
In my position as a WorkPlace FSC it was my job to take the bank into the business.
"Good Benefits, Horrible Management.  "
"this bank was great, when this bank was bank N. Since this bank took over, the overall morale of our department plummeted."
Things changed on a daily basis and were not communicated with the rest of our department.
"this bank started to push out the people that made 'too much' money for the people that made 'too much' money for their position's position, so this bank could downsize and hire in new employees at a lower salary."
A professional work environment.
"Working at this bank was a professional, structured job where accuracy, patience, and customer service were very important."
A Good company to work for.. I was responsible for managing a group of 12-18 consultants that serviced customers on a daily basis.
The group that I managed specialized in loan servicing.
Essentially servicing and providing insight on all the lending instruments provided by the bank with the exception of first mortgages.
I have learned a lot about the banking industry during my time with the bank.
Both within my area and across different departments.
I would say the most enjoyable portion of working with the customers is helping to find products that best fit the customers's individual needs and then making certain the customers understand any pitfalls or potential nuances the customers may encounter.
"On the other hand, not all customers choose to follow the right path and sometimes get into products or services that do no best represent not all customers's needs and can cause high levels of frustration for our clients."
Which in turn is reflected in our conversations.
"This is not one of the more enjoyable aspects, but it does provide the opportunity to turn the business around and perhaps even secure a greater wallet share."
this bank does not care at all about this bank employees.
"this bank say this bank do, but this bank's actions speak differently.."
Terrible place to work.
this bank do not care about it's employees at all.
It is all about the numbers.
this bank feel that this bank's brand is so strong that people will just flock to be a part of this bank.
Pressure galore.
this bank is bad about paying people enough for all the responsibility this bank have.
Need more changes.
If you are outside of Pittsburgh things are completing different.
"productive place to work, meeting and greeting customer service ."
"a typical day at work is transaction, customer service, and working with currency."
Daily face to face contact with customers.
"ability to build relationships, learn new skill sets and move within organization"
Co workers were team players and customer were nice.
Balancing cash drawer and maintaining funds.
Customer service.
I learned the ins and outs of being a bank teller and handling large sums of cash as well as the paperwork required.
Co workers were team players.
The hardest part of the job was working 10 hours 1 week and then 35 the next.
I really enjoyed the customer interaction.
"Great place to work, good benefits, flexible scheduling."
"Typical day at work would be assisting customer's with transactions, balancing your teller window, cross-selling and referring bank products, some problem resolution and other duties as assigned."
Co-workers were always nice to work with in a team environment.
Training given was always good.
Management was always nice to work with.
"Productive, fun place to work.."
A typical day starts by opening my email and seeing new request from clients and/or partners from another line of business.
Attending meetings to optimize work production and to learn about new processes.
Management does not micro manage which enables everyone to be independent.
The hardest part of the job sometimes is following all the procedures to complete simple task of the red tape was not there.
The most enjoyable part is the coworkers.
Nice place - low pay.
"I love working with my co-workers, unfortunately our branch is being closed."
Advancement into higher pay grades is difficult even if you have the education qualifications.
Branch workers have low pay.
I have met a lot of great people-customers and co-workers.
this bank.
"Worked from the comfort of my home, really what else can I say this job was wonderful."
How many people get to work in their PJ's with their feet up on their desk?
"Not many,but I did."
this bank decided to close the main building that I worked form so my job was moved to Pittsburgh otherwise I had planned on retiring from this job.
seniority .
The people who have worked for the company longer tend to get there way over new comes.
I like my job
and I am good at my job..
I key checks and documents.
I have learned how to look at the whole picture of the department and how each job effects each other.
I work 3 days during the week and 2 weekend days.
"My weekend supervisor is very knowledge, compashionate and a great leader."
"I not only like My weekend supervisor, but I consider My weekend supervisor a friend."
"Corporate headquarters recently this change in policy Corporate headquarters are no longer allowed to work overtime, which hurts me financially, but this change in policy also leaves me feeling like Corporate headquarters are not sustaining the best service Corporate headquarters can to Corporate headquarters's customeres."
It is hard for me to leave my work unfinish becaused of this change in policy.
Best part of my job is the people I work with.
We work as a team and try to provide the best services we can.
Micro-Managed Work.
"Basically, working in my department of this bank is like being in high school all over again..."
"actually, it's worse."
"You're not supposed to have extensive conversations with your coworkers, if any at all."
You have to keep track of every little thing that you do in a 'productivity database.'
"People tell on each other, instead of resolving issues with People."
"Team leads (one in particular) thinks Team leads (one in particular)'s the 'punisher', and enjoys bossing people around and reporting people for petty occurrences Everyone seems to be getting more miserable by the day."
"We have cake days for birthdays each month and food days, where we stuff ourselves with carbohydrates."
People need to move around more.
No wonder everyone is over-weight and unhappy.
The pay is horrible.
"Having acquired bank N and Royal Bank of Canada, this bank's compensation and bonuses have slumped significantly from what I've been told."
You only get 6 occasional absence days in addition to your vacation time and holidays.
"So whether you are sick and/or have a doctor's appointment or there is a death in the family or you have an interview, that's it for the year."
"And you can bet that if you want to use vacation time, you're going to get hassled for it."
"You may have a higher education than your manager's manager, you won't be compensated for a higher education than your manager's manager The up-sides are that job is not overly hard to do."
"You come in, punch your numbers, get everything it at a particular time, and then go home."
You don't have to take your work home with you.
New technology skills provided.
Overnight shift hours were great!
A typical day included several scenarios involved in the production and maintenance of client product.
"As lead Workflow Coordinator, I was constantly dependent on my team to make things happen, and my team consistently provided miracles."
pretty disappointed so far.
I am a loan officer with this bank and I'm very disappointed with my employer thus far.
the training was horrible I thought I was joining a company with 5 star training in pitts burg
and it's just not the case.
"my compensation was not what my compensation was told when I started,everything in this bank seems delayed."
I can tell this bank has the best interest for employees but the staff and the underwriters are not efficient enough...
there's definitely room for improvement!
You will work like an animal to get loans done.
processes timely most loan officers are doing the job of a processor too.
"Great Products and Services, Great People."
I was fortunate to have been part of the this bank family for 3 years now.
"Thinking back to when I started, there were so many people who gave so many people who gave their time and energy to help make me the employee I am today's time and energy to help make me the employee I am today."
"this bank products and services are very client-friendly, with tiered levels of sophistication for your casual bank user or your more in-depth, affluent bank users."
My work days for the most part were enjoyable and some of the customers made the day go faster.
"Management has changed since I first started, but originally, management was awesome!"
this bank had a fun-loving group that encouraged through rewarding hard work.
"I learned the bulk of what I know about banking now to this bank, and I will be forever grateful for the opportunity this bank afforded me."

Great employees and work environments.
the Team would constantly cooperate with each other to meet sales goals.
The most enjoyable part would be seeing customers with a big smile on customers with a big smile on their face's face because the customer service you gave.
this bank In-Store Bank.
I worked in this bank In-Store Bank's InStore channel for several years.
this bank's InStore channel is a great entry level experience for anyone looking to start a career in banking.
"The primary role of an In-Store banker is to prospect for clients inside of Giant Supermarkets with the purpose of recommending various products and services including accounts, investments, and credit instruments."
There are very aggressive sales goals which can be stressful at times but this bank In-Store Bank does provide you with tools to get the job done.
The primary role of an In-Store banker does require you work long non-conventional bank hours as the branches are open 7 day per week 364 days per year.
There are strong advancement opportunities for those that excel in those that excel in their roles's roles.
The primary role of an In-Store banker probably wouldn't be a good fit for anyone looking for a traditional banking position.
A great enviroment and friendly staff..
I enjoy working for this bank.
A great enviroment and friendly staff is friendly as well as this bank's customers.
Great place to work.

It was a great place to work and I learned a lot from co-workers.
Management was very helpful.
I learned very quick and would have stayed with the company but the company merged and moved out of state.
Poor Management/Took advantage of employees.
I worked at bank N/
this bank for 13 1/2 years.
I really enjoyed working there until the end of 2012.
Poor Management was very poor and Poor Management wrongfully terminated an employee.
I lost all respect for the company then.
I left the company after several other employees left bank N/
this bank due to Poor Management.
"Before I left I was doing teller work, teller supervisor work, and banker responsiblies."
I worked six days a week and hardly got a day off.
I would not recommend working with the company.
You have to be friends with the manager!
If the manager does not like you the manager will find a way to get rid of you.
No one should be treated that way.
I called bank N/ this bank's customer relations hotline several times and nothing was done
Stable company to work for.
Stable and established company to work for.

I learned accuracy while working at this bank.
Accuracy is key as your entering pertinent information onto the computer.
Management was great!
"Management made you want to work as hard as you could by encouraging you, and driving you to want to become successful."
Co-workers were pleasant and easy to get along with.
We all worked as a team to get the work completed.
The hardest part of the work was staring into the computer all day.
The most enjoyable part of the work was having free lunch provided by Management and also the excellent benefits that were provided by the company.
Great place to work good if you are new to banking..
An equal opportunity employer.
"Great place to work, good opportunities to grow."
not worth your time.
"Poor management, poor healthcare (insurance is from Pennsylvania - it works different in state of IL)."
Blame management for employees resigning there positions.
There is no respect to human and employees rights...
"There is no work and life balance, nobody ask you if you are able to work almost 60 hours per week!"
Incompetent and selfish teller supervisor.
There is so much favoritism with this branch.
I do not regret I resigned my position.
One of the worst places to work for!
Nice environment with excellent people to work with..  this bank has given me a chance to grow and prove my skills in a 'green environment'.
"People are very friendly, great company to work for with many great benefits."
A day in the life of online banking....
"My typical day at this bank was talking to and troubleshooting customer problems with using the internet to view customer's accounts online, paying bills, transferring funds, and other various banking needs."
I've learned a great deal about customers and customers's spending habits.
"More importantly, I've learned how to help an angry customer to being pleased within minutes."
My coworkers were good people and we always had polite small talk to keep things friendly.
The hardest part of my job was when I couldn't help with some customers''s needs.
"Sometimes people want things that aren't possible, or don't realize that people are actually in the wrong."
But some customers' were the people that were most satisfied when I could help people.
I really do like talking to people and helping with daily frustrations and problems.
It is an intrinsic motivation that makes me good about myself.

Management is horrible.
Monkeys would do a better job.
Employees are not cared about and advancement is nearly impossible.
Employees would rather hire outsiders before advancing hard working employees.
Company is more worried about sales than customers.
"under-staffed, low pay/ resources available to help employees."
"Tellers make very little money, you have to work weekends, no exceptions, Tellers do not rotate shift for part-time tellers."
under-staffing at branches frequently lead to stress factors for employees and dissatisfaction in customer service.

No job security.
Productive work place.
Very high volume of customers that we took care of daily.. Very productive work place that finished each month as one of the top branches in Louisville.
Very high volume of customers that we took care of each day and majority of customers that we took care of each day always came back with a smile.
I learned a lot about handling large amounts of money and working with older woman with a common goal of being the best bank representatives we could be.
"I also learned how to increase my abilities as a leader, because many things that needed to be done I would just take care of many things that needed to be done myself or contact my manager for help if needed."
I loved my co workers!
I love working as a team.
"The hardest part about my job was balancing even at the end of the day, because one small error could throw all the numbers off."
"And, I most enjoyed coming to work each day, seeing the smiling faces and taking care of the communities banking needs."
this bank truly cares about this bank customers.
Best managers I ever worked for.
This particular location was a slow location.
"Good for entry level candidates, but not long term."
"The environment was beautiful because The environment was brand new when I worked there, however, the management was not very friendly to the management's staff."
the management overworked many of us.
The trainer was very condescending if you did not catch on to what The trainer was saying the very first time.
It was so embarrassing to see The trainer and the management belittle other employees in front of guests and clients while other employees were in the branch.
"Very good company to work for.. I had went into work my usual shift, expected a normal day."
When I arrive to work we are short staff due to a teller calling out sick.
"My supervisor had report's to get done, there was several other task to complete."
"I worked the teller line alone as well as prepared all coin orders, process two ATM machines that day."
"that day was a very busy day for me, I felt like I worked alone that day."
When I arrive to work the next day my manager had called me into my manager's office to personal thank me for the wonderful job I've done.
"I learned that sometimes stuff happens, the only way to get through stuff is stay come and do your best."
"The hardest part was completing my many task while wait on customers, I didn't like for customers to wait."
Competition based environment.
You will learn great sales techniques and how to address yourself professionally over the phone.
A very tedious job with constant changing variables from customer to customer.
You will enjoy helping others get through financial troubles and help others get others's financial back on track.
"Co-workers are great, but management loves to micro-manage."
good company with great benefits.
"decent company with room for advancement, although there is frequent turnover on the retail side."
Great Place to Work.  
this bank focuses a lot on both customer and employee engagement.
Productive workplace.
I feel that I had a very supportive manager who was concerned with my success.
a very supportive manager who was concerned with my success was also very understanding and offered a lot of her assistance.
I like helping people..
Helping people with people's banking needs and to see if there is anything else or products that people would be interested in.
It was a good place to work for me because of it's close proxymity to my residence.
I loved it there.
It's a great place to workI whent in every morning and go straight to workprocessing checks by way of making decisions and watching out for possible fraud checksManagement team very polite and co-workers were very helpfulEmployee appreciation week was always very enjoyable
Productive and friendly workplace.
coworkers were very nice and so were the managers.
coworkers were very knowledgeable and willing to help with difficult situations.
Much opportunity for advancement..
Growth of the company offers greater opportunity.
The financial institution offers much in the way of financial diversity.
"this bank = Easy, Confidence and Achievement..  this bank is a great company to work for; the benefits are good, this bank offer 401(k) match, living well programs, and more."
this bank is very client focused and the organization's ideals are great overall.
I love that this bank is very involved in the community and that this bank have 'green' ideals.
"If you are great with people and are driven to help people but at the same time are sales driven, you'll love working at this bank."
Good company.
Overall I have had a great experience with this bank with some minor problems throughout.
Very Busy and constantly learning new information.
"The typical day at this bank, was very family oriented."
Constantly being informed about the changes that were occurring in the financial world and constantly in class to better you in your job.
OUstanding management team that cares about your well-being and making sure that you balance work and home.
The best part of your job was being able to discuss your work with other employees to get there perspective of what other employees would do differently.
good coworkers.
good coworkers to work with in a team environment.
Long hours of work day
None.
This was a difficult company to navigate.
Not very employee friendly.
this bank.  
this bank Is a good company to work for.
I've worked there for a year and a half now and this bank's a pretty laid back company.
didn't enjoy working here.
Unprofessional management and work environment.
Worked in call center.
Good company but stressful requirements.  
this bank is a great company.
Benefits are great as well as work/life balance.
The only thing that was overwhelming is the sales.
Requirements for investments and meeting the goals for the individual is stressful.
You have the thought of possibly losing your job or not getting incentive pay.
Banks don't pay you much.
There is no trying just doing.
If you can meet your goals and have the good ability to sell products and services any position at this bank is for you.
Banks are becoming more know for sales and more goal oriented.
Productive.
I really liked this job because I was doing paper work all day
and I always wanted a job where I can sit down and do something to occupy my time.
I learned how to work with others and how to sort papers and put papers into the volts.
I enjoyed my co-workers.
my co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with even though my co-workers weren't trustworthy either.
There really was no hard part about this job.
I hate this job ended so soon.
I really enjoyed being in the office.
The people there were really nice and easy-going.
"Good money, bad management."
Company is a decent company with pretty good products.
Base pay is $12/hr with a 10% shift diff if you work after 11am.
Management has a high turn over rate because the job is so boring and stressful.
"Take customer call after call, always busy, and there's never any supervisors around to assist with the crazy customers."
Not a horrible entry level job but you will burn out within 6 months.
i don't know how I did 2 years :-/
Great place for a part-time.
A typical day at this bank consist of helping and serving customers with everyday banking needs.
I learned a lot about simple banking and learned how ot handle large sums of money.
"My management was very driven, however sometimes that drive turned out to be impersonable and unapproachable."
My co-workers were great and very hard working.
We really worked as team especially when we had the pccasional difficult customers.
We always appraoched the situation in the best way possible to please the customer.
"Bad management, no morale.  "
this bank has the market cornered on customer service.
"However, the same cannot be said for the way employees are treated."
"I have never come across a company where management was such a universally miserable lot of individuals, who in turn passed that misery on to individuals, who in turn passed that misery on to their teams's teams."
"It was made painfully obvious on a daily basis your individual needs were of no importance to anyone but you and if this was unacceptable to you, you were certainly replaceable."
Every day was just the longest day of your life.
productive and teamwork advance place.
An 8hours typical day at work.
"I've learned to processed, received, various checks using a database entry level, Good Management overall and my co-workers are pleasant as well."
"The hardest part of the job was on the editing side and the most enjoyable part of the job was the hourly rate was good, sufficient enough to get an excellent group insurance."
Sales Driven Success.
"Lots of room for growth, great incentive plan!"
"I love working with my team, and watching my team grow and become even more successful."
"Great Team, Exec Leadership :-/. Would return... maybe."
The team environment is second to none.
"The benefits are O.K., but expensive."
The training is good but the internal computer software is lacking if you are coming in from one of the larger banks.
Very poor Wealth Management offering.  
"this bank Wealth Management is by far, the must unhealthy and unprofessional work environment I have been involved in during my 10+ year career."
"this bank Wealth Management is not only chaotic and driven by drama but this bank Wealth Management is all filled with gossip obsessed, immature individuals who operate with what gossip obsessed, immature individuals who operate with what they believe is a 'cut-throat' mentality believe is a 'cut-throat' mentality but in actuality it is childlike behavior that leads to poor results, lack of production and failed business plans."
There is no sense of direction given from upper management which leads to a free for all and a scramble for answers any time an issue arises.
The only way to get ahead is to 'yes' the under qualified senior management to death.
There is a lack of quality employees and work produced which is evident by the fact that clients pull clients's money out of the bank quite frequently.
Management hires with an outsourcing-type mentality-
"Management only hire cheap labor, with a lack of ability in order to give the appearance that the job is getting done."
Once the employees catch on to this cyclical pattern the employees move on or are replaced immediately.
"There is no room to develop your skills, perfect your art and truly produce quality work because at this bank Wealth Management, this bank Wealth Management are only concerned with 'putting a bandage over the wound' rather than actually healing the wound."
Appearing to produce results is far more important than actually producing results.
I would not recommend working here to anyone with an interest in longevity or the ambition to succeed in the Wealth Management business.
Good place to work in Pittsburgh.
"However, hard to advance or move around internally."
I've met several good friends and mentors while working here.
Great and Layed back enciorment.
nice envoirmentI learned how to be patient with people and how to pay attention to detailgoodCo Workers are the bestThe hardest part of the job will be leaving itthe enviorment is the best
Great work environment.
I represent 4 Regional Managers and 4 Regional Managers's client portfolios.
Three of 4 Regional Managers are based in Southern New Jersey and PA.
I am responsible to ensure that all 4 Regional Managers's loan transactions are conducted in a timely manner.
The most interesting part of my job is that my job is multifaceted -as
"I deal with monetary transactions, loan extensions, new loans, letters of credit and research."
Multi tasking and fast paced -as some of the transactions need immediate response ( e.g.wiring funds).Training consistantly to help us function better at jobs- which is very helpful and there are a lot of resources available.
The best part of work is that we have a great team and management to work with.
The hardest part is that we have learned that the job we love will no longer be available as we will be laid off in the near future and all our jobs will be moved to another state.
Good values and upper management.
"Although I really like this bank and this bank's values, I felt there was a lack of communication and understanding within our specific branch which in return may have caused a lack of a team oriented workplace at times."
Picked up many skills and learned a lot about the banking industry and was able to offer my skills and knowledge from my experiences.
The work days felt long at times but usually went by quickly if kept busy and searching fro ways to imrpove the company/branch and yourself.
I really enjoyed the ability to perform at a professional level through my experiences and what i have learned through my experiences.
"I was happy to share my experiences with my peers and superiors and help everyone around me become better; at the same time, learning from others the same way."
Didn't
like the employee advancement opportunities and the fact that employees came and went very quickly (usually at the employee's decision)

Banking in this economy.
Banking is a tough industry with the low interest rate environment.
The people at this bank are great.
The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients discover needs and fulfilling needs.
The downside is that management is under intense pressure to keep cost down while the worker is under intense pressure to keep cost down to ensure customer quality interactions.
"Cutting cost usually means limiting worker client interactions, which is counter to what clients want."
As workers workers are stuck in the middle.
Great Company.
Great Company to work for.
I enjoyed everything I did while working for this bank.
I was a Teller Mananger and i enjoyed my job.
"Fun, exciting envrionment."
"I arrive at work at 8 am, i procceed with my dail requirements of depositing currency and withdrawing currency as well."
My co-workers and I work together to accomplish more together.
"It is a fun ,enjoyable environment where the only part that is difficult is not being able to service all the customers needs"
"This was a fun place to work, management always encourgaged employees to further education."
typical day = making sure all documentation were received from the clients and reviewed to send onto underwriting.
Follow up with Sales reps to advise Sales reps of status on Sales reps's closings daily.
"What I learned - We had several training classes when employed for a short time Learned processing, some underwriting."
Co workers - the team I was assigned to all the co workers were so helpful and willing to teach everyone got along with everyone.
Hardest part
= I can't say there was a hard part of this job this job was a great learning experience.
I guess if have to answer this question the hardest part was dealing with sales reps sometimes to try to explain to sales reps what was needed or not provided for a closing.
"Enjoyable part of this job, was a great team and actually looked forward to going to work every day."
Productive work environment but micro managing is over the top.
•
"Maintain and improve customer relations• Provide quality customer service while managing customer complaints• Analyze, interpret and communicate detailed information/detail oriented• Meet monthly/quarterly individual sales goals•"
Communicate benefits of all consumer products and services• Conform with all quality assurance regulations• Strong phone communication skills
Employed for very short period of time.
I became a this bank employee through the acquisition of RBC Bank and was displaced after 2 weeks with RBC Bank due to position elimination.
"Fun workplace, but upper management is harsh."
"I loved working here with my current manager, but due to upper management being so stuck on customer service and numbers; the branch I worked for is always under the radar.upper management make your every day job hard because upper management do not give you time to work on what needs to be done."
Good Place to work.
"Good people to work with, make you feel a part of the team immediately."
"Work/Life Flexibility is great, managers willing to work with you when situations arise."
Appreciate that promoting within is a huge priority.
great working enviroment.
it is a great place to work with cool and awesome people.
it was a great learning experience
A great place to develop business relationships..
"I was responsible for managing, training, directing, and coordinating activities for a 7000 call per month call center in the Operations department, My position required heavy interaction with all departments of the bank not only in operations, but with the corporate banking department as well."
"I was also responsible for maintaining a budget, and meeting the financial plan for the department."
I worked heavily with the marketing department to assist in sales and to maintain current client relationships.
I loved My position because My position allowed me to work with so many different departments of the bank and with so many people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets within so many people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets's job function.
"I was required to put in long hours, and did take work home."
"I enjoyed managing people, I liked getting to know people and assigning projects that matched people's skills sets, that kept morale high and let people feel a part of what the unit represented."
The pros were much more than the cons with My position.
Summary.
This is a fantastic organization and I cannot say enough about my current management team.
"Unfortunately, the opportunity for personal growth and promotion is not available to me at this time and I am ready to move forward."
Paid the Bills.
I learned everything about banking products and services.
The hardest part of the job was that managers were always breathing down your throat for customer service even when you are in a sales role.
Great company with great benefits.....
I started with the company already with 14 years of lockbox experience.
I learned quite a lot from all my management team..
i had several managers durint my years there and several managers encouraged me to follow my dreams.
The hardest part of my job was the shift changes.
I started out on weekends and then went to day shift and finally ended on night shift.. night shift was the hardest..
I enjoyed the fairness and recognition all employees are given and the rewards also.
Overall the company is a great company..
this bank was an amazing job!
I loved my co-workers and everyone who knew me thought I was a team player.
this bank let me grow with-in the company..
My job was mostly Data entry.
I would start my morning off by running reports and also doing the swift reconciliation from other countries.
I would look over imports and exports and make sure the company's customers had the correcxt legal documentation to proceed with our customers's transactions.
Management was great!
"Management helped you in any way Management could, and Management made the work day easier."
My co-workers were well-rounded team players.

"Opening, during and closing procedures are expected to be followed through perfectly at the discretion of every supervisor, assistant manager and manager."
"Tellers expected to perform client transactions at the very minimum, with required pushing of sales, (must open a certain amount of accounts per month), as well as take on a major role within the company to prove worthiness of advancement, on top of all other responsibilities assigned by all superiors."
Hardest part of the job is meeting monthly sales requirements.
Most enjoyable part is the client relationship building and ease of computerized transactions.
Fast paced workplace.
"A typical day at work entails non-stop phone calls from borrowers, I've learned about the mortgage industry through customer service because all calls are generated through customer service."
Management is present but not very connected to actually working on the phone.
My co-workers are great from what I can recall because My co-workers have very little time to interact with one another.
The hardest part of this job is not being able to have a full lunch hour.
The most enjoyable part of this job is some of the people you meet on the phone.
Some times you encounter nice people that your really make your day.
Stressful Work Place with Life and Work Balance except for manager.
The hardest part of the join is the keep balanced the fine line between banking requirements and investment expectation.
Managers do not contribution to branch goals and are not held accountable.

"The hardest part of my job was having to handle technical difficulties as technical difficulties as they occurred during the day occurred during the day, technical difficulties as they occurred during the day were far and few between, but caused a decrease in this bank's efficiency when technical difficulties as they occurred during the day did occur."
Boring. worked with mutual funds clearing breaks daily using DST Vision.
this bank treated you below average standards.
this bank was the company not the people I worked with..  this bank was the worst company I have worked for in my 40 years of work experience.

The employee relations line is a joke.

Good company.
good people...easy work...
Easy computer system and good work life balance.
I think this bank was a wonderful company and trustworthy..
"I loved being a teller, seeing all of my regulars on a weekly basis."
"My coworkers and I became like family, seeing each other daily."
The hardest part of the job was only at balancing time.
"I had a lot of good times at this bank, a lot of good times at the bank brought a lot of smiles."
Nice place to work until they decide they need to cut people.
I had worked for the company for 8 yrs and had no real complaints until the company decided to start cleaning house and firing people for anything and everything while shrinking the department.
Call Center Environment.
I had an assigned que of Home Equity loans that I worked start to finish.
"Calling customers for missing information, advising of appraisals turn around time."
"Finally, calling branches and customers to set up loan closings."
"very professional atmosphere,and excessible management staff.. great place to work and develope as a employee.management is highly motivated in working with employee.management's employees."
Wonderful Ethics.  
this bank is a great place to work.
"this bank has excellent ethics, great training."
Terrible experience.
My co-workers were great people dealing with the insanity of a bank in Chicago.
The managers are all brainwashed 'synergy-ified black belts in Human Sigma' drunk-on-the-Kool-Aid-ers that renders The managers incapable of understanding basic human needs and emotions--it renders The managers incapable of even understanding someone is ten minutes late because of the CTA.
"Overworked, over-stressed."
I was never paid enough to actually live in the Chicago city limits.
"The payment scale for incentives/bonuses, unfortunately, favors the managers instead of the customer service associates that actually put in the work to earn good customer service scores."
Great Place for a Student in College.
"I worked here as a teller for only half a year, while I was working towards my Undergraduate Degree."
"However, during only half a year, I really enjoyed working at this bank."
The only reason I left was that I received an internship offer from another company.
"Productive, organized enviroment."
"Process and balancing of Philadelphia cash accounts via telphone with head tellers, balancing ATMS and processing of adjustments for customers cash deposits, withdrawals, and adjustments."
I learned more is involved with the banking processes.
"Strong Company, Cares about employees."
Seems that Strong Company's commission system is re-tooled often and Strong Company get paid less for that reason.
Management works with you to help achieve the goals you wish to reach in Strong Company.
Management over communicates on less important subjects and important subjects are skipped over .
very unorganized.
"very good training,poor employee relationships."
Very god benefits and incenitives
Dysfunctional.
"Sell everyone an Annuity, sell annuities, sell annuities."
Good place to learn.
Great company...great benefits.
I worked on the investment side and the retail investment management team is not very talented.
Typical tactics to micro manage sales goals.
"Professional banking experience given, many great opportunities to learn all banking needs for client.  "
this bank is great company to work for and has a wonderful work enviroment .
"unorganized, lack of team work between management sites.."
I learned to get everything in writing.
When their is disfunction and lack of team work understand disfunction and lack of team work truly rolls down.
All the way down to the janitoral staff.
Company closed.
Company closed down branch.
But a good company to work for.
Flexible hours.
Productive and fun work place its almost like a family.
"A typical day at work is fast pace and fun for the most part, I've learned different techniques in the banking industry, I have yet to proceed to the management level still preparing for that with help from this bank, my co workers are very team oriented and fun to work with, I would say the hardest part of my job is leaving at the end of the night when the work is complete, I enjoy everything about my job."
Loved working with the public as well as co- workers.
I learned a lot ..
My day would start by opening the safe receiving the night drop and setting up my station for the day.
"The hardest part of my job became the easiest, and The hardest part of my job was dealing with the public face to face."
"The key was and still is , is to listen and have patience."
I enjoyed my job because my co- workers and a lot of the customers became a family.
During the holidays we exchanged gifts (within reason) and food and we had a good time.
Good Company.
They were a great company to work for.
They where always good to their employees.
They had a great co-workers.
Excellent Company.
"Collections, receivables, repos, collection reports, development meetings, legal process on accounts considered not collectable."
Multi-tasking is very important because your involved in every aspect of banking..
"As a in-store sales consultant you are a teller, financial consultant, and a mortgage adviser."
Work environment being in-store is very hectic and the turnover is high with employees.
a lot of jobs were lost and the people who were left behind had double the work.
"Very stressful, I learned a lot about Real Estate Services but my forte was being an Executive assistant."
The Senior Exec.retired so they did away with my position so I moved on with my career.
Caring management.
"-Providing excellent customer service skills to each this bank customer.- Reaching out to prospective clients and building a strong customer base.- Help clients with financial planning decisions for retirement, education, day-to-day expenses and investments.-Work with companies or individuals to plan for companies or individuals's financial futures by offering information and guidance on topics that include taxes, and investments.- Adhering to bank and regulatory policies and procedures is critical to providing high quality service to the card services clients and your business partners.- Assure the accuracy of financial transactions by reviewing account reports and verifying the data."
Structured and on a time frame for funding activity..
Get the reports printed in timely manner and obtain approval for overdrafts by deadline.
"Productive place, advancement oppuntunities."
Sitting at a computer and keying in teller- customer transactions.
Management is understandable to personal and professional needs.
Diversity of co workers
Banking environment.
"Typical work day was board meetings, typing memos and doing anything administrative."
Management was forever changing.
Poor Employee Relations.
I was harrassed everyday by new manager.
I received three stellar performance reviews from my previous manager.
My new manager had a problem I was gay.
All of a sudden I became a poor performer.
"I wasn't going to get a pay raise and when I asked a colleague for more information about a position in a colleague's group, new manager got wind and slandered me."
"I told employee relations of all the issues I had with new manager, but employee relations did absolutely nothing."
"In fact, employee relations continued to support write-ups for poor performance."
"I was forced out of a position in her group, having been told new manager would continue the daily harrassment and punishments unless I quit."
"I uprooted my life in Florida to move to cold, cloudy Pittburgh for three-plus years."
What a waste.
"Over 15 yrs, first as bank N Bank, then as this bank i cultivated a loyal customer and co-worker based enviroment.."
"My day typically began by opening the branch, setting up daily cash buys, loading the Atm and customer night depository transactions."
While operating a teller window I also pulled reports checked audit items and supervised the teller line.
"As supervisor, i never asked my tellers to do a task that I wouldn't do, building a mutual respect."
The hardest part of my job was leaving at the end of the day and the most enjoyable was arriving each morning.
I truly enjoyed my job.
"Rewarding, customer service based.."
I was rewarded by the relationship I built with my customers.
I had been at the same location for many years and I knew my customers on a level in which my customers had built trust in my opinions.
Many would wait until I was available and I learned a great deal about my customers.
I focused a lot on learning a great deal about the company's products and services in order to do things right for my customer the first time.
The hardest part of my job was referrals.
"Most of the company's customers were repeat customers, in the branch more than twice per week, Most of our customers had everything that Most of our customers needed."
I enjoyed my team and we worked well together to accomplish daily task.
"My manager had a lot of experience and when My manager had the time to focus, I learned a lot from My manager."
"Many things that I learned I took personal responsibility for, and helped my team stay updated on new procedures and policies that I had noticed."
It was difficult to be promoted within the company due to large turnover on the teller line and lack of support from manager and supervisor.
Unfair Layoff.
Poor Employee relations...and poor treatment of Individual employee by Managers
Average place to work.
"I enjoyed my time there, but I wanted to focus solely on the investment side of the business and that opportunity was not there at this bank."
Nice place to work were other peoples opinions are accepted.  
this bank is an excellent place to work and this bank provide with you the tools to be successful and advance in the company
I had worked for this bank and this bank's predecessors for 39 yrs and was let go for following a policy with Natl City in 2006 that is no longer accepted with this bank.
I truly enjoyed my job and I planned to retire from this bank when the time came.
I supported two Regional Managers while supporting 30 banking offices in order to obtain goals and maintain proper staff.
"I prepared and collected numerous reports, completed all human resource functions, followed-up on all training for every employee in 30 banking offices and supported staffing issues."
I learned much about the banking industry and the changes over the last 39 years.
I always enjoyed my co-workers because I felt like I was helping each branch achieve goals and that was the most enjoyable part of my job.
The hardest part was always having time to get everything completed in an 8 hour day.
I have always been one to want everything completed before going home and some days that was not possible.
Not Good to work for if you want a life outside of work.
Upper management does not care about Upper management's people or its people's work life balance ...its all work and no life..
lots of misrepresentation in the interview process your told one thing by recruiter and then once you accept the postion things are not the way things were told to you ..
I was a branch manager i choose to leave because of poor treatment from my regional my regional was clearly not qualified to have the postion my regional held and has no people skills whatsoever and a complete lack of respect for my regional's direct reports time and skills HR needs to seriously review what is going on there
This place is the absolute worst job ever!.
"over 120 mortgage files for one processor, you can only close 30-40 tops per month, They never close purchases in time don't pay overtime."
pproductve place and a place to at.
productive training classes to get u ready for the job and knowledgeable people to count on at anytime.
I fee that this bank can do some improvment to make the employess enjoy there job.
"On a typical day it was very busy,by the end of the day i could end up taking 800-1,000 calls."
I did learn a lot abt the products this bank had and what to ed cust and waht products what fit there banking needs.
"There were time when we had to switch teams but during the time we did work together we worked well together by encourageing one another waht goals was needed to be met to get this bank's bounus for that quarter.the hardest was cust that was able to be helped at that initial call and had to be transfered to a sup, reaching goal for th bonus and employee appreciation day was enjoyable"
Close group of people willing to share knowledge so all can advance and support out clients in an effective manor.
I have learned that without working together we can not satisfy a clients request.
We teach each other new things that we learn everyday.
Work with clients to make sure that clients have the best services to fit clients's comapnies needs.
Work with collegues in the field to assist with documentation and satsifying the client.
I enjoy working with the clients and building that bond with the clients thaty I can get it done for the clients and make the clients's work life easier.
Stressful place to work.
Training did not match actual job experience.
Management more concerned about earning Management's incentives and if you did anything to threaten that you were constantly criticized.
One worker was actually hostile.
Hardest part of job was no help in getting orientating to the office.
The only enjoyable part of job was interaction with the customers.
new everyday.
"Assess each client's unique financial position, risk tolerance, resources and objectives."
"Council clients regarding specific retirement, college or estate planning issues."
Banking is Banking.
Great place to work.
Banking was a good environment and management was helpful.
I left to make more money.
Great People.
My coworkers are great.
I really learned how to deliver great custonmer service!
Loved working there.
"Worked in various positions, respected the management, enjoyed working with my co-workers, the most enjoyable part was getting to work with many different people in many different areas of the bank."
High integrity company with best in class Banking.
Workplace Banking Program offers the best consumer banking products anywhere.
awesome company to work for.  
this bank required all employees to focus on all employees's customerrealtionships.
this bank provided me the tools to be successfulin providing exceptional customer service
Productive and Rewarding..
"Very busy with a very large number of customers, I learned theimportance of an excellent customer service, as a Teller SupervisorI had to be aware of customer's needs."
that work Cash is oneof the most delicate tasks and what that implies.
The power needsof customers is the most satisfactory part of that work.
"Mult-tasker, data entry, and overlooking work load.."
Enjoy going to work everyday which each day is different.
Making sure all customer accounts deadlines are met.
I filled in whenever we were short handed besides doing my supervisor duties.
this bank.
A typical day at work starts before 8 and can end late depending upon the time of year.
Management is helpful and wants to see the younger folks succeed and advance.
The hardest part of the job is the learning curve.
The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers.
There are great people at this bank!
Monatary Incentatives.
"A typical day at work, filing work, making new loans, data entry, destroying old loans."
stressful.  
this bank as a whole may have been a good place to work but my branch had a lot of moral issues I did not agree with.
A very professional atmosphere geared toward great customer service.
A typical day at this bank included processing various transactions for customers.
Performing account maintenance and resolving customer issues is a huge part of delivering great customer service for myself and my former coworkers.
Management worked well with the tellers and supervision and guidance was always available.
The hardest part of the job was the low staffing we were allocated which made it difficult to deliver fast customer service for the clients.
The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and making banking easy for the customers.
Customer Friendy Environment.  
this bank was a good job for me that taught me the skills of cash management.
I worked with a lot of great employees that really taught me a lot.
I enjoyed working with the business customers I served the business customers I served were like family.
the business customers I served always told me the business customers I served's joys and sorrows and showed great respect.
Mostly Fun workplace.
Typical day I work from home.
I may instant message some of my friends good morning and begin chatting with customers.
instore.
in store positionfor the out going personmost enjoyable day to day with customers
Great place to grow not only on a career level but also personal.  
"this bank is a great bank to work for, I personally learned a lot from my coworkers and my managers."
Started as St. Francis Bank and in 5 years I learned 4 new computer systems..
"Mid-America Bank bought St. Francis Bank, bank N Bank Purchased Mid-America Bank then Mid-America Bank acquired bank N Bank."
great company.
i loved working for this bank this bank are a great company with awesome employees.
the managers tend to sheild the bad employees from consequences.
"Busy, with great customers and co workers."
"Day consisted of supervising a teller staff of sevenscheduling for employee engagement as well as proper staffingcompliance, audit and teller errorscustomer problem resolutionsales and coachingmaintaining and ordering branch cash"
Multi-layered tax department with specialization of duties within department.. started early and ended when the work was complete and the deadlines were met.
Good experience.
I loved that job over all.
I enjoyed helping customers.
Eager to learn new things every day.
this bank does not value the experience and knowledge of long term employees..  
"this bank has a history of terminating long term employees and replacing long term employees with less experienced, younger talent which does not cost this bank as much for benefits and salary."
this bank cares more about this bank's bottom line than employees.
Management does not live up to the values that Management preach.
Loved the people I worked with over the 20yrs I worked there..
Had the best co workers every!
The hardest part of my job was trying to stay above water when the economy went bad.
"Productive, solution based environment, with varying responsibilities and expectations."
"Productive, solution based environment, with varying responsibilities and expectations"
A Company with a Great Vision.
"I love my job, truly and seriously."
"If I didn't need more money and feel like I was being overlooked for advancement opportunities, I would stay there forever."
"There are not many banks that people can say people are PROUD to work for, yet I am PROUD to work for A Company with a Great Vision.."
I believe in the services and products A Company with a Great Vision.
"provide clients, I believe in the service model, and I believe in my co-workers."
"Unfortunately, being constantly under-staffed and not receiving a raise despite performing well in 2+ years in my position, I am simply ready to find advancement that doesn't seem to be possible at A Company with a Great Vision.."
Great for the Independent.
"When things were running smoothly, work was a breeze."
Working the mailroom machine was no problem at all.
"If a problem arose that I could not handle, my supervisor was close by and we had a mechanic in the room behind us."
Certain weeks were predictably more trouble some than others.
"On the easy weeks, we got off early."
Nothing Sticks.
The company is a revolving door.
Employees in the retail segment are treated poorly though the customers are treated very well.
Management does not address problems and there is very little recourse for management error unless a sales goal is not attained.
Good Experience.
The call center - The call center honestly was a great place to work - lots of fun with co-workers and a lot of team work.
I use the training about owning a problem all the time.
I wish more companies cared about more companies's employees half as much.
Productive and supportive work enviroment..
It is typically an 8:30am to 5:30pm workday.
Fridays are until 6 and there are occaisional Saturdays.
We are a small office so cooperation and team work are vital.
The most difficult part of the job is currently the hours/commute.
Traffic is getting worse.
My favorite part is when I can help a customer.
"It could be doing transactions, giving a customer options, or just listening to thier day."
You will be very unhappy!.
Very difficult company to work for.
"Micro-managing is rampant, pay is VERY low compared to competitors."
Management lacks respect.
I can't stress enough how miserable current employees are in my region.
Overall 3 rating.
#NAME?
I would say that is probably one of the best things about the job.-Culture/ Vaules : it's okay
they are all about customer service.
"customer service is the nor what most customer interaction jobs.-Job Security/ Advancement : very bad, very bad..."
You can walk in everyday and just making one mistake can be the descision of your job.
I remember walking into work and getting told everyday how you can lose your job.
Growth opportunity was very weak..
All I can do is laugh about advancement and the first word that comes to mind is ***Cheap.
"You hear about the bank making billions, but when it comes to job opportunity there is no agreement."
If anything the bank will try to pay the same pay rate but with more hours and say at least you have benefits.
Then smile on in your face.-Management : I believe this category can be different in any company.
In my example my teller supervisor was great.
"However, the branch manager was just ...."
BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.
Not only did my manager didn't care about us the branch manager will talk trash behind our backs.
What made my moment bad when I was told that I should be happy to even have a job because people with more education and experience will die for my job.
People will die for 15k a year.-Work / Life Balance : working wasn't the problem I did my job very well.
If anything I was trusted to do things a supervisor will do.
Life balance was not good.
Work schedule is base on work requirements and needs.
So why when I try to continue my education and I ask for mornings and the other part timer wanted afternoons - more...
I don't care for the company's's policies which affect consumers..
Hard to be fair because the company's was bought by this bank and within a year over a thousand of the company's were let go.
"Depending on the branch, nice place to work."
Can be an easy place to get promoted in.
You tend to learn a lot on the job as opposed to web training or conventional training.
"Branch management is very good, but above Branch management Branch management gets iffy."
"Hardest part is the customers, and on top of that, customer service surveys that you have to deal with every week(and having it tied to your pay)."
Most enjoyable part of the job is the people(some customers but mostly co-workers)
Ups and Downs.
Good but not great.
Lack of direction at management level and lack of growth encouraged.
this bank is a great and exciting place to work..
"The location that I work at is a warm, friendly, family oriented environment."
Was a great place to work before bank N Conversion.
Have seen all of the values and culture of this company change in a negative way since the Conversion of bank N. this company bought bank N. because bank N. were failing as a company.
Since bank N Conversion I have experience the control struggle between this company and bank N. employees.
"The former NCC employees are winning in the battle, turning this company into the same company NCC use to be."
Sad day for this company.
No back office support at all anymore.
Only accusations of misconduct by Legacy this bank employees not wanting to go against polices and procedures that were put in place before bank N Conversion.
Great.
It was queit interesting.
"The managers had favorites that could do no wrong, but as a whole its a goo company to work for."
this bank.
"A typical day at work was doing standard transactions such as cashing checks, withdrawals, deposits, payments and checking balancing."
this bank also would transfer funds.
I personally handled a lot of this bank's hardware malfunctions and called in problems or fixed problems when I could.
Co-workers got along just fine.
The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers yelling at this bank.
The most enjoyable is when this bank got to be friends with some of this bank's customers.
Proactive employer in the banking arena.  
this bank strives hard to maintain and improve controls.
this bank is constantly growing through strategic integration with existing banks and review of current banking locations.
Long repetitive work day.
"The hours were long the management style was micro-management, and the work was repetitive."
"Tactfully performed finacial functions also addressed customers inquiries.. - cashed checks, withdrawls, deposits, maintained proper cash limits- performed clerical responsibilities- co-workers were friendly and helpful- provided outstanding customer service-"
the hardest enjoyable part is satisfing customers
Nice place to work.
Nice experience overall.
Came here in march 2011 and enjoyed to be a part of this project.
Productive and good company to work..
"The this bank mission is Ease, Achievement, and Confidence."
"Generally, people are friendly and helpful."
We're in an environment that empowers us to grow both personally and professionally.
it had its days.
There are some good things i can say that i really liked about working for this bank
but I'd rather keep my experience working for this bank to myself.
great place.
One of the best jobs i have ever had and t was an excellent place to worki
Easy going place to work..
A typical night is productive and very busy at times.
I am crossed trained in various departments within the operations department and can run the Itran area without supervision.
Majority of my co-workers are team players.
"My job is easy, if I have to add a hard part I guess a hard part would be reading some of the hand writing on the checks."
Strong company with strong values.
"This bank was great, I loved working with This bank as much I loved banking with This bank."
This bank value the employees as much as the customers and are a true pleasure.
Clear line between Management / employee.
"Plenty of managers, very few leaders."
Most development is now outsourced to less than qualified vendors.
The ability to build and fix is hindered by processes that do not make sense.
"On the positive side, the schedules are flexible and benefits seem better than most."
It was a good place to learn basic customer service skills..
It as a great place to get your foot in the door for basic customer service skills.
Low stress level and well balanced place to work.
Senior managers demonstrated concern for employees whose positions were being eliminated..
"Most of my responsibilities for overall management of outside law firms, work-outs and direct contact with loan officers and senior managers of diverse business units were immediately restricted when this bank acquired this bank."
"I was assigned to assist in the transition of one business unit and one business unit's ultimate liquidation, and quickly relegated to handling a small task that I had previously delegated to other paralegals and support staff."
My direct manager was thoughtful and genuinely concerned with assuring an orderly transition of my responsibilities to other lawyers in My direct manager's team and the orderly wind-down of my personal involvement.
My co-workers in the law department were great resources and helped me integrate into My co-workers in the law department's culture.
"The most difficult part of the job was participating in the liquidation of a business unit where I had worked for 14 years, and the elimination of the jobs for more than 100 of my former co-workers."
"Also, it was difficult to tell co-workers to refer co-workers's questions to others who had assumed my roles when I otherwise would have been capable of immediately answering co-workers's questions."
"Maintaining a positive attitude while under a 6-month transition period was more that difficult, and without the support of the this bank transition team responsible for the orderly liquidation of one business unit, would have been impossible."
"this bank is very structured and fractured in this bank's management and business operations, which leads to significant levels of dysfunction, confusion, and lack of accountability."
"There is a high level of employees feeling responsible for significant matters, - more..."
Great work enviorment.
A typical day at this bank consist of finding financial solutions for this bank's clients.
I've learned what cues and clues to look for when engaging in conversations with clients so I can direct clients to the right associate.
I have great relationships with my coworkers and management.
Not being able to accommodate all a clients needs is one of the hardest parts of the job.
The most enjoyable part of working for this bank is getting to know this bank's customers
Good starting out job.
Overall the job is good.
The pay is excellent for part-time.
the job relies heavily on everyone doing their part because team work is the heart of the bank.
the job is the same every day.
"You do the exact thing over and over, with very little variety."
There are chances to be promoted and it's encouraged to seek out chances to be promoted.
The downside is the heavy reliance on teamwork.
In order to do your job the very best everyone else must do their jobs their very best.
If someone isn't there or isn't performing as a team member you all suffer.
Even with the monthly performance reviews it's difficult to understand what the expectations are and how you are measuring up.
Sometimes it seems like the rules change from day to day.
While working here I have learned a lot about personal responsibility and ownership of my job.
I have also learned to just let things 'roll off.'
"the job is simple enough, but has a lot of procedure and rules."
"You have to be patient with yourself as you learn all the rules, regulations and procedures."
The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off around 6 most days and not working Sundays.
Overall the job is a good job.
Excellent learning opportunity.
I was responsible for creating spreadsheets containing different types of data as well as helping to organize networking events for a training program.
I worked with one other intern on some projects and we worked well together.
I had a decent manager who for the most part always had a set schedule for me to follow.
"At this internship I learned how to work in an office setting, mostly dealing with learning to work under a manager, meeting deadlines for projects, etc."
Not a bad company.
"If you work for instore, you are a sales person."
"You are required to get customers in the aisle and try to get customers to switch to this bank, you are required to spend two to four hours a day in the aisle."
All your interactions can be surveyed by Gallup and you must receive a 4.8 and up.
"Go into the position knowing that you are a sales person not a teller, etc."
Great company.
Banking in wealth management department.
Enjoyed the diversity of job task/multi task.
Kept me busy
Bank Going Downhill.
Management reserves the right to encourage by threat.
Very distrustful place to work.
Constantly have to watch your back.
Started Management's decline in 2008 when two banks came together.
Market Management does not understand this bank Culture and creates friction.
Operational manager looks to find problems.
Local Sales Manager feels threat are the only way to go.
"Branch personal were great to work with, unfortunately Management Values like Integrity, Teamwork, Work Life Balance were non existent."
Productive and advancement.
Ongoing learning experience about the banking business and able to advance in the banking business.
Able to work different shifts
A Honest Review.
"If you are able to maintain hours of repetitive movement and work, employment at a this bank Lockbox is a move in the right direction for you."
There are different parts of the working body that makes a lockbox function successfully and different parts of the working body that makes a lockbox function successfully require a steady and concentrated mindset.
"employment at a this bank Lockbox is volume driven meaning that, the more you do, the better employment at a this bank Lockbox is."
"However, you are penalized by your errors in terms of monetary value."
"This position is very detail orientated, which means every detail counts and every mistake hurts."
Unpredictable and Unsteady.
This was a contract position that was intended to be 40 hrs/wk.
Over the course of the 18 months it actually lasted it averaged to around 26 hours/week.
"Compu-Com (the prime contractor, Insight Global was secondary) was unable to create a steady supply of new equipment to the technicians keep the technicians steadily busy."
Some weeks had no work at all others were full.
"No benefits, paid time off, or anything else."
Enjoyed the end users I worked with and the this bank support staff was mostly very helpful.
Flexibility is the key here.
Okay place to work.
Easy to learn but management makes it difficult to advance.
this bank is a great company to work for with an emphasis on customer relations..
I believe this bank is a good company who emphasizes on pleasing this bank's customers.
Easy fun job.
Hours are amazing and are more flexiable than standard retail hours.
excellent company to work for.
great company to be employed with has a lot of room for growthhas exceptional customer services
"my job wasn't just a job, my job was an extended family to me...not only towards my co workers but my job extended to my clients as well.."
Working at my branch had nothing to do about a paycheck.
If you ask my former supervisor my former supervisor will tell you just how much I loved my job.
this bank taught me everything I know.
Recent graduate from High School at the time.
I negotiated with this bank HR Director and I stated if this bank HR Director gave me the opportunity for a full-time position.
I will volunteer my time to go on career day to high schools of this bank HR Director's choice.
That moment this bank HR Director was only offering part time employment.
this bank HR Director gave me the opportunity for a full-time position and I fulfilled my promise.
I learned from my supervisor an acted on this bank HR Director's behalf when this bank HR Director would go on vacation.
I liked the fact that the department loved my ideas to organize our different tasks.
Very productive
and I loved every bit.
"The hardest part was resigning the schedule clashed with my school, there was no way to adjust my work schedule."
Fun place to work and challeges.

Bank Teller - Large responsibilities managing money.
It was very interesting to learn how banks work and make sure all money is accounted for and in the right place.
Fast paced team work..
I have worked for this bank less than a year.
The position is only part time.
I am not able to take advantage of all the benefits this bank has to offer due to me being only part time.
I have learned a lot in the short time and I enjoy the people I work with.
The work we do at the ATM Processing Center is very important and I am proud to be part of The work we do at the ATM Processing Center.
I have several duties during the week and I enjoy all of several duties.
I just wish I had more hours.
I support myself and it is very difficult in todays economy to make ends meet on a part time job.

Fun Place.
"Loved working for this bank great values, not enough people to cover"
Very unhappy.
I did not like going to work.
I worked part time as a teller and I felt as if they did not like me.
"This particular branch, the women were very snobby!!!"
The manager hardly ever cracked a smile and a lot of two face going on daily.
"Very unpleasent place to be, even part time. :("
"Great, fast and friendly place to work."
This is a great and fun place to work.
Fast pace and good friends.

productive and customer friendly enviornment.
Branch is a very busy branch where we are customer friendly always.
We always make our customers feel special.
We are required to cross sell products on a daily basis .Management is always available to coach and help in any issues.
We work as a team with all the co workers.
Best part of my day is being able to help a customer with any concerns.
Hardest part of my job having to be on my feet all day.

There was alwasys a Challenge.
Working at the bank was a constant challenge.
Issues would always arise which meant we had to be on top of our games as problem solvers and leaders.
This environment really set aside the men from the boys.
"respectful atmosphere, and a team environment."
"I loved going to work, I would start my day by checking on my 8 employees and making sure my 8 employees have everything my 8 employees need to start my 8 employees's day."
"If not, i reconciled these issues."
"I would start my own responsibilities, and do my individual tasks, but was routinely helping out my team with issues, and even my management when even my management were overwhelmed!"
"The most enjoyable part of my job, was I was BUSY!!!"
"I love to be busy and I love that I was able to do many jobs, so when someone was out, I could fill in, and my department did not fall behind, The worst part of my job, was when we closed the doors and saying goodbye to people who I became friends with and many whom I respected!"
A potentially great company that has grown too quickly to keep up with the big banks and still relies on the company's antiquated infrastructure and management..
I was originally very excited at the opportunity at this bank.
It took quite a while to be onboarded into the company and even longer (6 month) to be assigned my book of business.
My team helped me along more than my manager and My team are truly the only redeeming quality at this bank.
I began really working my book in January and we were told an incentive/structure change would be taking place shortly.
an incentive/structure change didn't happen until March and completely flipped the way we were incentivized upside down.
The most frustrating thing is over a half a year later this bank still don't have the reporting necessary for us to do our job based on all of the changes this bank made for 2012.
I could go on and on about our systems and all of this bank's issues but I do love helping my clients and making a difference.
I have been recognized as a top performer so even though I still don't know where I stand I have been told that I am doing the right thing and doing the right thing well.
As far as the company the company do things to make you feel proud at times.
the company's 'Grow Up Great' commitment is wonderful and the company really do put thought and innovation into the company's retail product line.
But then the branch systems are prehistoric and nothing is in real time.
The branch positions are too closely layered to make sense to the employees let alone the customers.
The line of business partnerships are all very one sided or completely non-existent.
I really do want to make this bank work for me
but I don't think it will ever happen.
"Decent THEORY, no practice...  this bank as a whole is still going through many changes as a company."
"While this bank as a whole are a heavy-hitter in the Financial sector, this bank as a whole do not top the list for places to work."
A typical day at work for a teller: Arrive; process transactions throughout the day accurately; meet quotas for a wide variety of products; balance cash on hand accurately.
"I learned more than enough Federal Regulations, and working with numbers on a daily basis, you can't help but get better at accounting."
"My co-workers were all pleasant, the co workers that had had ten or more years of experience were welcoming with loads of advice and stories, the co workers that had been a recent addition were only around for about 4-6 months and either quit or were let go."
"I had been told by customers, different sections of management and former co workers, that there was a VERY high amount of turn over."
And there is.
Management in this bank as a whole varies.
"Upper level management is cordial, but Upper level management are running a business of numbers."
"Branch-level management is tricky-hidden agendas are prevalent, petty egos, not all of the managers in charge are qualified, some of the managers in charge should have retired when the love went out of the job."
Applicant beware if you like your 40 hours drama free.
"I won't go into details about my personal experience, but my manager looked the other way for customers on many occasions, including when they were ABUSIVE to the staff and was VERY bias about refunding fees."
"In my branch, my co-workers and I had a difficult time figuring out what was expected of my co-workers and I as employees because it constantly changed."
You COULD end - more...
"Good corporate values, but difficulty advancing."
Fair benefits/compensation but mixed direction for advancement.
Contradictory statements from management about career path.
Does not see value in higher education.
nice coworkers.
"I loved working for this company, benefits were good, co workers were nice, and a quiet place to work in."
I would work for this company again.
The only think I wasn't used when I started with this company was that since this company was a call center.
how much security there was.
and everything you did was tracked with your computer and ID cards.
It di make you feel like this company didn't trust anyone.
But I would still work for this company again.
I loved my job and the people that I worked with.
"Great company to work for. offers good 401K plan, health plan, great help.."
This company is one of the top companies to work for in my opinion.
This company offer a good benefit package even if you are part time.
"I loved working for This company, I just didn't like the position I was doing."
Job details.
I was in charge of setting up the phone systems in the morning for receiving incoming calls for wire transfer.
Incoming money transfer are called to business and customer when received.
I learn to be patience and compassionate with my customer and co workers.
The hardest part of my job was making sure the overall work process at the end of the day for outgoing and incoming wires.
I enjoyed a challenge and love solving problems
Productive and fun with great advantages and benefits..
Working for this bank was a great experience to learn the ends and outs about the financial world.
The most enjoyable part was meeting and networking with others.
Productive Mortgage industry.
My typical day at work includes submitting bids to the investor for properties that are in default.
I learned that work that is outside the investor guidelines has to be submitted for approval in order to insure that we protect this bank's's interest in properties that are in default.
this bank's ensures that we met our goals and reach deadlines.
Terrible company to work for.
Try to avoid this company for employment.
"this company are a great bank to have as your bank, but a terrible employer."
"I worked in a call center, and while I understand there are constant changed in call centers and banking, this company just overdid it."
There was constant change and this company expected you to adapt immediately to constant change.
Every few months we'd be purchasing another bank yet this company could not afford to give our call center eating utensils and plates and napkins to eat our food.
I worked at home from just under a year and was brought back because of 'performance issues'.
"I was told I would be able to go back if I improved, however I was never given the coaching time needed to improve my skill set."
this company don't care about this company's employees.
"this company recently the purchase RBC Bank in the southeast part of the country and since the purchase, our call center is now closing down because it's cheaper to pay those who work in the southeast part of the country."
Just an overall terrible company to work for.
Absolutely terrible.
The managers working there had no clue how to run a call center.
Great manager and department to work in.
Enjoyed the job and the people I worked with during this time with the company.
get a job somwere else.
mc donald would be better..
operations specialistFormer Employee not a nice place to work for.
they treat you like you a five year old.. menagement think only of them selfs.
they would sell you down the river .just so they could get a head.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"lol and that does not mean lots of luck"""
Great customers and wonderful coworkers.
A usual day consists of helping hundreds of customers with day to day banking.
"Aside from typical banking we assist hundreds of customers with we also have relationships with hundreds of customers, know hundreds of customers by first name and can have friendly conversations with hundreds of customers."
Working next to coworkers and management is a delight.
Probably the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendliness that is exchanged between customers and amongst the coworkers.
"There are difficult aspects of the job, one of the most difficult is encountering fraud of any kind."
Learning and fun workplace..
"A typical day at work was doing different types of transactions, like deposits, withdrawal, cashiers checks, account maintenance etc."
",I learned about being courtesies to all the customers, handling cash properly with full attention so I could settle at the end of the day without any shortage or overage."
My co-workers are quite understanding.
My co-workers used to help me if I have trouble with any particular customer or account.
The hardest part of the job was to pay full attention to the cash handling and answer responsibly to the customer's questions.
The fun part was meeting lots of new people everyday and interacting with lots of new people.
Overall was a good place to work..
I loved working the second shift.
The benefits were good.
I enjoyed working with my co-workers in the department in which I worked.
There wasn't anything that was hard about the job.
Management did provide good training for the positions that I worked.
The most enjoyable part of the job was my working hours.
"Concerned with image, not employees."
I worked for the call center in the call center's business department.
I would get screamed at relentless by customers and scolded by QA for not being more sympathetic.
The training was not up to par either.
"You're trained for a month before you're on the floor, however if you take on any other department functions, you get maybe a few hours."
ok place to work.
bad hours 3pm to 2 am quiet no talking rule.
attendance policy was very strict could not miss any days at all for 1 year.
Good place to work for a short term.
Not many opportunities for career growth..
"A typical day at work would consist of prospecting business customers, by way of computer generated leads, cold calls, and onsites."
"I have learned many new aspects of business life cycle mgt, business lending (underwriting) and cross sell techniques."
"Management performance is different from region to region, depends on were you are."
Depending on your position it is an average place to work.
While I did enjoy the type of work that I performed I felt that the Management didn't encourage atonomy and lacked consistent communication.
Productive work enviroment..
Provide customer service to clients.
Offer products and services to customers to help customers with customers's banking needs.
The hardest part is sales for me.
"Most enjoyable part of my job, is getting to know our customers."
Dependable work place.
Reqired to work under high stress situations and short staffing.
I have learned to manage people and keep a balance of happiness and accountability.
My co workers are fantastic.
"The hardest part of the job is the constant change in policy and procedure, though the constant change in policy and procedure is not unmanagable."
The most enjoyable part of the job is the knowledge of knowing that I am needed and respected for my position.
horrible place to work.  
this bank does not care about this bank employees one bit.
All this bank care about is the shareholder and the fat cats in upper mgt
Banking Industry.
"No comment, adding a review will breach company confidentiality agreements."
Teller.
"Summer Job, it was a busy day with careful handling of cash and customer service"
Unloyal morals.
Very good company and corporate relations but fellow staff and management have no problem slandering names and lieing about past employees.
fellow staff and management's so called ' branch family' doesn't matter when it comes to speaking up for promotions.
this bank.
A great employer.
Management is good.
The hardest part of the job for me is the limited advancement for this bank.
the most enjoyable part of the job is interactions that I have everyday.
Great place to work.
"Loved working at this bank, great working environment, fun, fast paced, seen lots of customers everyday, had a great superviser and great employees to work with."
Great company to work for.
"After a 6 years with the company I have nothing bad to say, the company are are great company to work for and offer many employee benefits."
Do as you are told and you will advance well..  this bank is a very good company to work for.
The benefits are outstanding.
There is room for advancement as long as you apply yourself.
"this bank are very strict on inherence, talk time, and tardiness."
Quality customer service.
Great Company.
A typical day is all the same.
You come in do your work and go home.
They don't like you to talk so its kept to a minimum.
They really don;t care about your personal issues.
productive place.
great company and people.
work was very fun there and enjoyed working with the customers
Excellent company to work for - room to grow and move up.
"Loved working for this bank, as a contractor I worked for this bank for about 10 years."
"this bank is a growing company, caring for not only this bank's employees but also the community."
I enjoyed the most is working and interacting with the different departments - the people for the most part are very professional.
The are a hard working group.
It was a growing experience for me and I learned so much in the processes.
The hardest part of the job is losing good acquaintances and co workers as good acquaintances and co workers move on to better positions within this bank.
this bank strives to continually improve and grow and are real survivors in the midst of all the other banks folding up or getting caught in bank scandals.
The downside to this bank at this time is that this bank have not set up shop in the Southwest part of Florida where I currently moved to.
"If given the chance, I would definitely love to work for this bank again."
"Please, Please this bank - COME ON DOWN!!"
Excellent Company to work for.
"Lots of opportunities to earn commission, Great team of people."
Opportunities to learn everything about the company and advance.
Provided excellent customer service.
Management was very hands on.
"Flexible work schedule, dedicated co-workers."
Job is fast paced and fun.
The different projects each year are similar but always varied based on information sent in by clients.
"Great benefits, few layoffs.."
"Overall, this bank Mortgage has proved this bank Mortgage to be a very solid company."
I have learned a lot while working there.
back up head teller full time teller.
"Customers were somewhat pleasent got to know many new people learned a lot used it to my advantage but as far as working for this bank, horrible management does not listen to horrible management's employees about customer service who handles customers day in and out, horrible management don't understand what the customers really want horrible management go by a gallup to review horrible management's employees which is silly horrible management basic the entire branch off of a gallup instead of hard work and customer achievement and word of mouth, always works short staff go through managers like you go through socks, the pay is horrible, horrible management don't treat horrible management's employees with respect, management makes the job more stressful the the job is, most enjoyable part of the job is some of the co workers you grow to care, and everyday customers but this bank really needs to get it together starting with how this bank treat this bank's employees, so if your looking for just a job with some what ok hours not to good of pay just to kinda of get you by this bank is your job but i would not go full time the job and pay is not worth it part time is ideal for the job."
Also this bank give new rules almost everyday and the head teller and managers change new rules when the head teller and managers want or use the ones that benefit the head teller and managers as need.
And again the pay is a joke.
And minorities get less money go figure horrible job.
just ask any teller
"oh yea wanting you to stay later because they are short staffed but then asking you to cut your time because they allow no over crazy want to take your time away from your life and family but don't want to pay you for it cheap cheap cheap, only keep there part timer at 26 hours, no matter if they are going to have help for their full timers or not leaving you by yourself alot of the day to handle customer do the atms and the vault and everything calling customers."
Also not holding the employees that are not doing the employees that are not doing their job well's job well accountable making the entire team suffer for one or two people.
I'm just happy Im gone most people who leave pnc move on to bigger and better things
and i am one of most people who leave pnc.
i didnt want to give most people who leave pnc any star but the system makes you
Nice place to start.
good experience for customer service40/hr work weekMy most enjoyable part was helping customers with customers's issues.
"Great company, lousy pay."
My manager and co-workers are the best I have ever worked with.
this bank offers nice benefits and is really good about encouraging a nice work/ life balance.
The only downside is that the entry level pay is lower than any of the other banks in my area.
"Good place to work, great people."
My years at this bank were productive.
"this bank treats this bank employees well, this bank have a great incentive program and health care package for part time employees."
The flexible work schedule is great for working parents and for someone who is attending school.
Not the best company.
To much favoritism in this company!
LOw pay!
Not the most friendly environment...
Catty co workers
Fast paced working enviroment.
I conduct teller transactions as well as cross sell products.
I had to meet a daily goal and be able to work in a fast paced enviroment.
it has a great atmosphere!
love the people i work with.
Great company... room to grow within company.

I have learned that there is always room within yourself to grow.
this bank Review.
As an intern I would work on projects that were given to me from Sr. Management.
projects that were given to me from Sr. Management would include running Nassau reports as well as worked on the SOX team and helped the SEC to proof read some reports as well.
Sr. Management was great to work with and Sr. Management were fair.
"Hardest part of the job was when I had to leave, because I loved the job so much I was really sad when my internship ended."
The most enjoyable part is that I stayed busy and loved working in the Regulator Reporting dept.
the finance part of my job was great.
Customer Service.
I worked in a private branch in a retirement community where personal relationships are a must.
Most seniors enjoyed the convenience of having a personal private branch in Most seniors's own community.
"I learned to treat the elderly with patience and compassion, as well as seeing a business and a relationship opportunity on every issue."
Management was excellent.
"We did a lot of cross training with our employees, which made our job fun and interesting."
"The hardest part of our job was probably closing a private branch in a retirement community where personal relationships are a must late, since we constantly had clients coming in."
Sharing conversations with the elderly and listening to their advise.
"Awful, awful."
A wasteful company that doesn't pay A wasteful company that doesn't pay its employees enough to actually live in the city limits.'s employees enough to actually live in the city limits.
But A wasteful company that doesn't pay its employees enough to actually live in the city limits.
can afford to have a food truck driving around town handing out hot dogs to homeless people.
Unrealistic expectations + low pay and terrible benefits DOES NOT equal happy employees.
this bank was a fun place.  
this bank was a great place to work for.
A Typical day at work began for me by opening the branch and signing in to my computer and getting the bank vault opened and count the money taking care of the atm and many more things though out the day.
Management was some what easy to get along with.
My co-workers were great to work with most of My co-workers.
The hardest part of my job was telling non clients that non clients couldn't cash a check written out to non clients because non clients didn't have an account with us.
Most enjoyable part of my job was my customers my customers were awesome.
Rewarding career..
"During my banking career, I served in a number of roles working as part of a team as well as independently."
"The last ten years of my employment were in a telecommuting role, working as a float analyst, participating on projects, and serving as a liaison between the transportation courier service and bank branch personnel in Illinois, Missouri, Florida, Kentucky and Indiana."
"Great Job, no advancement."
no advancement in this company.
Good work life balance.
Great benefits and 401K
Enjoyable company.

Run for your life from this company.
Meager compensation.
Awful management.
"HR supports upper management, not the worker bee."
"HR say all the right things, but the corporate environment is horrible."
Good luck ever getting managerial support or a decent pay raise.
Review.
I only worked here for 17 days due to my position being eliminated with the purchase of another bank.
another bank treated displaced employees with great respect.
"Good pace to work, same as Washington Mutual."
Washington Mutual bought out this bank.
I really enjoyed working for Washington Mutual.
"Management was very good, everyone helped everyone and the work was completed."
Sad Story.
If you want to be treated like a child and work for a robot than this bank is for you.
It really didn't take long for new employees to learn that new employees were not going to be happy and I have never see so many people leave after only working for this bank 1 month.
Its sad because legacy bank N employees really loved this bank and also legacy this bank employees would agree that this bank was a better place to work before the merger.
I think this bank really just got to big to fast and management is not able to grasp it.
Great option for advancement!.
"Was a great company to work for, would recomend."
Pay was good for area.
"Would have given 5, but management a little slow on getting things done for employees."
"Advancement is done by work performance not time with company, which was great for me!"
East Charlotte Site Closed.  
this bank was a great place to work.
this bank had good hours and management in place.
East Charlotte Site grew rapidly and I progressed quickly.
The downside is that East Charlotte Site closed after i had been there for about a year.
Not a very good job.  
this bank has a very cusotmer service centered culture.
I work in the sales area of one of there call cneters and hate a very cusotmer service centered culture.
this bank have no sales focus at all even my incentive as a sales rep is partly based on customer service.
this bank also pay quaterly incentive at very low rate.
I worked for National bank before we merged and was much happier.
Not the greatest!.
I loved my job far better when my job was bank N.
I am so happy I am not there anymore.
I put in ten years there and got nothing in return.
"It seems that once bank N. took over, things got really bad."
bank N. are or seem to be 'weeding out' former bank N. employees so that former bank N employees can start over with newer (and cheaper) help.
Management at the branch level was not understanding AT ALL!!!
"Co-workers were very nice, friendly, helpful and understanding."
"I remember one time when the power was out and the managers, including the regional manager, made us all stand outside in 100 degree temps.."
"One person ended up getting sick and I personally get heat stroke..to the managers, including the regional manager it didn't matter..the managers, including the regional manager said to go outside to talk to people and let people know there was no power and that we were closed!"
(Seems ridiculous when we could have just put a sign on the door!)
A job I will not forget.
Words can not explain I've learned a lot working with this bank this bank just need to work on this bank's commutation skills with this bank's employees a lot better
great place to work.
i enjoy doing what i do there.

I loved everone I worked with.
We all helped each other when there was a problem or concern.
A company where you can get a lot of variable products..

Now a days you don't find free checking accounts.
Was an ok to work when it was RBC Bank RBC Bank bought RBC Bank back so my job changed and I don't currently like what I'm doing.

Product and services.  
this bank was a great for this bank's trainning New Hirer and Monthly Sales Meeting.
The one thing that stands out was the none-consistancy of sales and service's.
We all know that things change daily however to be productive you must stay consistant with your staff.
What goes for one it goes for all.
your staff must also listen to what the staff is saying in order to get a feel for consumers needs and increase sales.
If you have someone doing a job and increasing sales you go with what you have and work with it.
Sales is the object of the game as long as you are following the banks guildlines and not putting the bank in a bad position to lose business.
