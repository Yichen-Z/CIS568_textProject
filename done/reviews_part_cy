3806,"Poor Working Environment","There is such a high turnover rate that nobody knows what they are doing. If you are a newer employee and have a question and asked multiple people you will get a different answer from each person. Branch reps call in constantly because they get very little training and they don't know what they are doing. Customers are constantly angry because they get incorrect information from employees. The management is extremely poor. The coaches and mentors are even worse.

Honestly, it's up to the individual employee to determine if they will have a great day. If someone finds it difficult to see the good in any situation, they will not be satisfied anywhere they work In general, this bank has been good to me because I have been good to them. Although I have a lot going on in my life, I still manage to come to work with a positive attitudes. You get back what you give and if you are willing to give your best, others will see you shine and great things will happen for you and those who shine with you. this bank may not be for everyone, but I am doing the most with what I have with this bank and when it's time to transition to something new, I will still be proud to tell anyone that I've worked for this bank.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","April 19, 2017","5.0"

3818,"Childish environment","This company has so much potential and where 1 manager wants to care for all, 5 want to create and foster an environment of immaturity The whole universal model theyve implemented in branches in which a personal banker does the job of a teller and a sales agent as well as an assistant manager yet only gets paid for one of the titles, is the most unsafe model EVER. in the span of a few months a few branches (INCLUDING where I worked at before transferring) were robbed at gun point I am on my way out and wouldnt recommend working at any branch that has this universal model but overall i think the company means well and its just filled with too many people who care very little about others and just want to do whatever they can to be liked by the higer ups.","Service Associate I","Former Employee","Atlanta, GA","April 18, 2017","3.0"

3821,"Great company","It was a great place to work with co-workers and a manager (and actually other managers as well) there to give you support. The training was not as good as it should have been and on-the-job-training was hard to do with everyone with a client and not having someone to help you. That slowed me down a bit. My branch was Universal, meaning you worked all aspects of banking. Teller, platform, and lobby. Great concept, but hard to do in reality. However, those that can be persistent and can close sales, you will make a boatload of money. I loved helping customers. I didn't like trying to sell to customers unless I knew it would help them out. Banks are a business and I hate I couldn't be that person they wanted me to be, but they supported me and gave me all sorts of help in trying to make me a better banker. I have no one to blame but myself. Geat company with good pay and benefits and time off.
