1709,"Not A Healthy Work Enviroment","I was a personal banker for this bank full time. The sales goals are impossible, with even the top performers in my branch struggling to even come close to their numbers. The training is very minimal and management is reluctant to help, even though banking is a highly regulated industry. I was verbally abused by my manager on several occasions but was just told that that's how she was and to just deal with it. On a typically week, you would be making around 60 cold calls to try and get people to make an appointment to come into the branch. Investments was a big focus for the company but we struggled to find referrals for an FA who would not even speak to the ones we could refer over.

You will slave out and maybe see $33,000 after your first 2 years if your lucky. They don't care about you as a employee just there customers, they grade your calls on 3 calls month with calls being being the best. Now let me tell every set rep has there own way of scoring calls even know they have a guide they have to go by. They all hear calls differently so good luck with that.

The biggest problems I have faced within the branch is poor management and time management skills. Many people have come and gone from the branch that we will be short staffed on many occasions in which we have to take on extra hours. Also, if there is a difference in anyone's cash drawer, everyone working that day have to stay until the mystery of the missing or extra cash has been resolved. There were plenty of times we had fun and weren't too stressed but those times are rare. The branch I was in was very busy so serious yet smiling faces had to always be present.
