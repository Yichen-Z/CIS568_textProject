552,"Doing better with technology","I spent a little over a decade at this bank and during that time they started getting serious about putting into place updated technology. They went from old stuff to newer tech. That part was good. One part that wasn't good is that management was hit or miss. For the last 5 or 6 years I had a manager who really didn't do much to help with advancement or getting the training needed to do better. And then his manager made vacation taking difficult, especially around Christmas and New Years. ","Support","Former Employee","Portland, OR","January 4, 2021","3.0"
553,"Bank teller","Decent bank to work for but the pay is low, and you always have to sell all sorts of financial products, credit cards, to people that don't have money anyway. So why induce people to get in more debt when you see they already don't have money. There are monthly goals that probably no bank/branch achieves but are there to put you in a hot spot. Worked here while in college. After graduation I moved on to a better stable and nice job. don't't work in banks. They're so unethical ( what a shocker, of course they are). ","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Fairfax County, VA","January 4, 2021","3.0"
554,"Diversity was the only plus","Everything else was awful. Being a call center, you have to take way too many calls. You literally do not have a full second between calls, the second a customer disconnects there is another customer already speaking. They literally track your bathroom time. Everyday you have a 15 min team meeting with about 10 ppl in the middle of hundreds of other employees and they rate you on about 8 different Categories. They put this huge board and write in red marker everything you did wrong. It's awful. ","Customer Care Consultant","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 30, 2020","1.0"
555,"Good","I feel that this bank is a great company to work for.

","Credit Card Specialist","Current Employee","Remote","December 30, 2020","3.0"
556,"Good job but it can be stressful and disheartening","The customers reviews on your service can make or break your experience here. If the ATM doesn't work and the customer gives this bank (you) a 1 star rating, it destroys not only your quarter but the branches, too. You meet wonderful regulars and build relationships but survey and sale expectations are unreasonable.","Part Time Teller","Former Employee","Michigan","December 29, 2020","3.0"
557,"Good Place to Work","It felt like working with family. Everyone at the branch was extremely friendly and caring of one another.

561,"Worst working environment. ","The environment at this job was one of the worse. It was extremely stressful and unfriendly. Most of the management was impolite and rude. It encouraged separation amongst employees, as opposed to team work. They didn't want us speaking to each other. There were a multitude of changes that occurred quite often with poor training. The environment is too uptight and not employee friendly. ","Online Banking Consultant","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 24, 2020","3.0"
562,"Horrible place to work!!! They do not care about customers ","Most promotions will not be people of color. Customers are not put first. It takes months to get loans closed because departments are fighting internally. You can escalate to management and nothing will happen. Worst company I've ever worked for in 25 years. They will lie to you during the interview and tell you that everybody is earning a bonus, that isn't true. They find ways not to pay you a bonus. You will not even understand how you earned or didn't earn a bonus. It's some gorilla math equation that they have on an excel sheet and you don't get a copy. Again the worst company ever. Talk a great game but it's all lies!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend anyone work here and I never have. ","Loan Processor","Current Employee","Jacksonville, FL","December 22, 2020","1.0"

568,"Pushy sales on products that aren't good for the customer. ","Nice talking to and meeting new people. Management only cares about making money. You must be very good and pushy with sales on everyone. Good pay, good vacation. ","Teller","Former Employee","Muskegon, MI","December 15, 2020","3.0"
569,"It's alright"," this bank is fine. The salary is not where it should be considering how much they make you do and the size of the bank but you do get a minimum of 3 weeks of vacation. Benefits are fine. Moving up is very difficult as HR gate-keeps a lot. Everyone seems to work a lot, managers included (avg 45-50 hrs/wk). this bank talks a big game about being customer-centered but they are not. I worked in the branches and in an operational capacity and I can tell you that this bank makes it hard for customers to anything in a modern, easy way. Now if you're struggling to find a job/need some experience or get your foot in the door of the banking world then it's not a terrible first step. But get your 1-2 years and get out because raises are nonexistent and the workload only increases.","Branch Banker Associate","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","December 15, 2020","3.0"
570,"Good place to work sometimes"," this bank is a good company to work for most of the time. They are pretty easy going when you hit all of your goals, however when you don't, get ready to hear your manager micro-manage you all day long and repeatedly tell you what to do. They offer little to no salary increases on a yearly basis.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Washington, DC","December 15, 2020","4.0"

572,"great place to work but.....","Depending on the team or branch your experience can be great. but if your on a team that doesn't work as a team then your screwed.

574,"Horrible- stay away from AML","Stay far away from AML here. They do not pay well, they bring in new people with higher salaries but make the wrong decision on who to hire. Raises are a joke! Even with meeting and exceeding all goals you get 1%!! We daily work overtime but are salaried for 40 hours, we work between 55-80 hours a week with no choice, we work on vacations, we work on 'paid holidays'. We always work, we are treated like garbage, they pick apart any mini mistake you make from typos to attachments, you better no reach out to management or you will get talked down to for even speaking to them. They hold round tables with high ups where you can't even express things because others tell management and you get in trouble. Turnover is insane here for these reasons and more. We have QAs, investigators, managers and analysts quitting daily or weekly. Stay away!! Any bank is better! ","AML Investigator QA","Current Employee","North Carolina","December 11, 2020","2.0"
575,"Good Company: Horrible with internal advancement","The company overall is very good. However, even for top performers, the ability to get meaningful pay raises year over year is extremely limited. This promotes a culture of jumping jobs either internally or externally to get ahead. ","Strategic Sourcing Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","December 10, 2020","4.0"
576,"Worst Working environment for clients and associates ","Worst financial Institution to work for. Poor Management guidance, coaching and motivation.

579,"Universal Banker","The good: The compensation for the Universal Banker role is pretty good, and you do really well with referrals, selling credit cards, and meeting your quarterly quota, you get decent bonuses. The workload is pretty decent, I guess it also depends what your branch is like.The neutral:The products are just like any other bank, the difference is how they name them. It's important to go over all the fees with customers when you open accounts because some caught me off guard (example: when you can charge for a replacement card/when not to charge)The bad:I've noticed a lot of turnover lately with bakers and managers; and when you don't have a branch or assistant manager to guide you through your first few weeks, your constantly looking up policies and procedures by yourself, and trying to learn 3 different systems. In my specific branch my colleague have helped a bit, but I can't help but think they are planning an exit too. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Orlando, FL","December 6, 2020","3.0"

581,"Work From Home"," this bank is a great work place- I have the opportunity to work from home, it's very comfortable for me because I have over 10 years of customer service experience. I've been employed with them over a year now. I like it due to the high call volume, team leads are very helpful, I've been on two different teams and both were awesome! As long as you come to work on time, follow the rules, and provide excellent customer service you will go far with this company!! I've been promoted three times in one year!","Loan Servicing Specialist","Current Employee","Work From Home","December 2, 2020","4.0"
582,"Conservative company with poor management","Some successful people were terminated at this bank just because they reasonably complained about their branch manager's behavior. Instead of helping them, the higher management terminated them for a bogus reason. I worked with them personally and know what was going on. People can't speak out freely and are afraid of losing their jobs. I left because I realized that this bank is not the best place to develop as the bank encourages a hostile atmosphere in the branch. If you don't complain and meet their sales goals, you'd be most likely fine. Some branches, however, have great managers that value their employees, but those are rare. Other than that, if you work hard, you can earn good money there.","Service Associate II","Former Employee","Pennsylvania","November 25, 2020","2.0"

586,"Management is horrible ","Only two maybe three managers out of the many that I've met have actually been good managers. The others have no business being a manager. The training is horrible here and if a manager has it out for you for no reason other than they're bored or trying to look good to higher ups and money hungry, you're scared to lose your job. You're expected to know things you haven't been taught even in roles you haven't been in a full year and written up for not having enough appointments even during a pandemic. Their computer system is as old as the hills and not easy to manage. Have I mentioned their training is awful?
