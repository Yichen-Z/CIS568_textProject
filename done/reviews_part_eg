5506,"If it wasn't for my co-workers I would have quit 5 months ago","Management is inconsistent. Each branch is ran completely different. Part timers are treated less important. As a part timer you have no sick or personal days and no vacation until 1 year. If your child is sick you must have a back up plan, if your back up isn't available you must have a back up plan for that back up plan, otherwise you're screwed I have the best co-workers, if it wasn't for them helping me get through I day I wouldn't have lasted these 6 months. Oh and you're forced to take a mandatory 5 days off in a row and BECAUSE YOU'RE PART TIME it's unpaid!!! So you're forced to take off a week without pay. I don't know about you, but that pretty much screws all of my finances.

She will stalk you on Facebook and other social networks, get other employees in the branch to find out about your personal life by stalking you as well. She Daily does things to make it horrible to work with her. She constantly bullies her employees into thinking that she has the power to fire you at any given moment, she delegates her work out to all the employees and does basically nothing herself, if you ask her a question she gets angry at you and retaliates by giving you more work to do that she is suppose to be doing. She offers no positive feed back about the work you do only responses with negativity. Upper management has been informed of this and still nothing is done with this woman.
