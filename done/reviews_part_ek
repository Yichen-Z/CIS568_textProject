5702,"this bank","I worked in a lockbox at this bank. We had several daily deadlines that we tried to meet with proficiency and accuracy. I learned to see how the way I did my job affected the rest of my department. My co workers were efficient and I developed some valuable friendships while I worked for this bank which I will have the rest of my life. Hardest part of the job was when management would not allow me to stay past my shift to help the other shifts. I know that there was a budget to be watched, but I thought getting work processed was more important because it effected the customers' finances. Most enjoyable part of my job was completing my work and helping the other shifts keep up with their work. What did I think of management? I realize the office manager had to do what the corporate managers told them to do, but I believe corporate was too concerned with this bank's profits and not enough about meeting the customer's needs. They seem to have forgotten that if enough customers got disgusted and left this bank, the bank would start losing business and their profits would go down.","Senior Operations Specialist","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","July 25, 2014","4.0"

5706,"Great coaching and support"," this bank is a great company to work for. Their commitment to coaching and training is truly outstanding! I loved working in different areas of the branch and being utilized anywhere I was needed. You truly have to have a passion for customer service when working there, and of course like any other banking position, thick skin because you are working with our customers money. You need to be able to say NO or tell them why their account is over drawn, or say why their loan was not approved. this bank is known for being the most conservative banks around, but I was a very proud member of this bank and will always be thankful for my time there! I learned a great deal, and had an awesome experience.

5709,"Worst mortgage position I've ever had","Unfortunately, there is little positive I have to say about my experience as a Sr. Loan Officer at this bank Mortgage. Getting loans processed, underwritten and closed in a timely manner did not seem to be high on the priority list at this bank. Processors would not respond to voice mails and emails for days. Clients were left hanging with no information about the status of loans. Loans did not close on time. There's more, but suffice it to say that I would not recommend working at this bank for anyone who wants to be in the mortgage business long term (keeping commitments is a primary job for longevity as a loan officer and the support at this bank was almost non-existent).","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Spring, TX","July 21, 2014","1.0"

If you want to go to Wal-Mart to beg people for checking accounts, this is your place. Otherwise, work somewhere else.

5742,"Aggressive Sales and Relationship Management"," this bank to me is the best bank to work for in the banking industry. Over the course of the past decade, sales has becoming more and more aggressive to interest and convince clients that their bank is the best. At this bank, you are the best because we tailor a conversation specific to get information form the client and have them talk about themselves. As a Relationship Manager, we use what they told us and fit them into the correct products and solutions. this bank is aggressive but in a different way as they show they care for the relationship over just the sale. The sale means that person will get their Credit Card, Home Equity, Mortgage, Car loans from a different bank rather from the person from this bank who is already discussing this with the clients. A highly recommended company to work and gain experience in the industry.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Scotch Plains, NJ","July 6, 2014","5.0"
5743,"Diverse and dynamic working environment for a developing financial company"," this bank is a robust and advancing competitor in the finance industry. It was recognized as an employee-centric company by many standards. However, actual workers there may believe otherwise. This fast-paced, demanding job may exhaust your quality of life (which is a key component of their core values). The benefits package appears to be substantial on paper until they're necessarily utilized. Yet, an assitance program with average resources can mainly rectify and ameliorate some of these issues. Overall, this bank's compensation alongside requirements is not commensurable, though with the dynamic managing personnel any individual will flourish.","Customer Service Associate","Former Employee","Washington, DC","July 5, 2014","3.0"
