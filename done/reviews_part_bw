They push their employees to the point of burn out, then look for reasons to terminate your employment. this bank does not take into account local management opinions, or knowledge of their direct employees performance. When they want to fire someone, they do it regardless of your immediate supervisor's opinion. Corporate Employee Relations 'tells' Managers what to do in matters of employee terminations. It is not a 'collaboration' as they claim. Those decisions come from a far away state, from a corporate level, from people who know nothing about you personally, or professionally.","Assistant Vice President","Former Employee","Franklin, NC","June 13, 2018","1.0"
