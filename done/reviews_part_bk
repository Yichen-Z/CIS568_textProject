1802,"No work life balance","This company boasts a work life balance as one of it's most important factors. Well, maybe if you're at the top, otherwise I have never had less of a balance in my working career. There is no support from management and even if you beg for 'Required' training, often the branches are too busy to schedule you for it. I was there for 2 years unable to complete new hire required courses! This place might work for you, but it was the worst financial institution I have ever worked for.

Unfortunately my management was very poor. Regional manager didn't seem to care. Manager didn't allow us to speak our mind with new ideas it was either her way or the high way. As I said this bank as a company is great. Ok pay and good benefits. They could work on not making the job so demanding so employees can spend time with their families during holidays.

You are tied to the phone for 8 hours and have to account for time when you are not talking with customers. Like any other call center, management will beep on your phone to find out the reason you're not taking calls. I didn't learn anything new because i've been in a call center environment for 30 years.

1822,"Not the place for capable technical people","The only real qualification for management is seniority. Because the majority of them have limited skills, all good people, being managed by them, leave. So the people who stick around and get seniority, and are the next generation of management, are pretty lackluster. Truly capable technical people are too valuable to be allowed to leave the legacy apps they have patched repeatedly and are left in place. Unfortunately, Senior management's preferred solution to any project is to add more management. They do not take the time to really know what is going on and function as a sheltered clique unto themselves.","Senior Software Engineer","Former Employee","Cleveland, Ohio","January 18, 2019","1.0"
