400,"Branch Banker - Pressure Overload/Miserable"," this bank loves to underpay & overwork you. Long hours (if you have family or doctor appointments, or other commitments - they are not privy to accommodating very much & if they do it's always an issue) - they preach work life balance but will be micro aggressive with you when you use your time. Workplace culture is toxic, managers are so stressed out & dump so much pressure onto employees & bankers & it makes for an overall miserable experience. Pay is horrid, only good if you're a single individual - not good for a living wage especially considering cost of living in NJ.Most enjoyable part of the job was going home.","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Clifton, NJ","June 4, 2021","2.0"
401,"Fun place to work but also depends on branch ","Being a Universal Banker was a juggle for sure, I had positive influences around me but I feel like I fell in the cracks for sure.

402,"Mortgage Loan Officer","I worked for this bank for nearly 10 years. My time at this bank was miserable. Expectations changed regularly and goals were unattainable. The only thing this bank executives truly care about is their image.

403,"Stressful ","Very stressful and demanding place to work. It does not matter how long you have been with the company. They have no loyalty to their employees. Always under-staffed. ","Teller","Former Employee","Hackettstown, NJ","June 2, 2021","1.0"
404,"Usual Large Corporate IT Environment","Not about to bash this bank, as they pay me decently well and I work from home in rather stress-free position. But it's not overly fulfilling work and often times I don't feel like we have a clear vision of what we're doing. Seems like every few weeks/months we're jumping on the latest and greatest technology or idea. Also, it takes an act of God to get anything done. So much red tape it's ridiculous. And, as a developer, I find it very hard to get my job done when the security measures on my laptop block me from accessing websites and running software I need to perform every day job task. Plus, this bank's commitment to left-wing politics and taking every opportunity to shove it in my face is not super appealing to me.

405,"Employees ","The group of employees I worked with were excellent. Everyone worked as a team to reach our goals. Management was great in the branch I worked at.

406,"Worst job ever","I was a Business Banking Specialist, and worked here 4 years. This was hands down the most stressful miserable job I've ever worked. The customers were never the issue.

408,"Was a very good company to work for. Excellent benefit package. ","I enjoyed each day coming to work. I learned many things over the years. The hardest part of the job was the constant customer facing duties with no help from the last manager. She chose to close her door and only do clerical work and did not help manage the customer flow or take any customer appointments. The previous manager, he was a team player and helped all his employees manage customer flow open accounts whatever he needed to do. The newer manager has now lost almost all the previous employees due to her mismanagement and causing issues due to confidentiality with each employee. She chooses to speak about one employee to another and keeps drama going instead of being a team manager she tears the team apart.

414,"It's a job","I've been working at this bank for a year and a half and I will say they have very good benefits but they're a few things that need work. They claim you can advance after 6 months but that's not true because even if you're doing well with metric goals and you apply for another position and you accept it then a day later you get an email that they went with someone else. This has happened more than one occasion even with coworkers. The systems are so slow. Also the pay is very low for the verbal and emotional abuse you experience from customers daily.

416,"Just an 'eh' place to work.","Decent benefits for a financial institution but that's really the only good.

It's basically a white collar factory job and they literally call it production for a reason. Lots of turnover and for good reasons!!","AML Analyst","Former Employee","Rocky Mount, NC","May 16, 2021","2.0"
419,"Typical job in Banking","I learned a lot about banking. They provided classes and many other educational tools to learn how to better do my job.

421,"Don't work here.","I know of over ten people in my small little branch and the surrounding branches who left this bank to go work for KeyBank for good reason. Advancement is almost impossible. Management is TERRIBLE because the nepotism is blatant. The anti-robbery practices of 'lobby engagement' are useless and customers DO NOT like someone coming at them with an iPad when all they want to do is see a teller or banker. Most of my time at my branch, we had either no manager, no teller lead, or a bad manager and a bad teller lead. We were always under-staffed. Lunch breaks weren't guaranteed, but you also get in trouble for eating behind the counter. Who cares about your health, right? Anyone with any sort of management position is a snob and thinks they can talk down to you because they're slightly less underpaid to deal with all of this than you are. Seriously don't work here. They're gonna phase out tellers anyway.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Twinsburg, OH","May 14, 2021","3.0"
422,"Great coworkers, not so great upper management ","The culture is great at this bank. The pay not so much. Started off entry level, so low pay was expected. But as time went on and I exceeded my sales goals, the raises didn't come. Then trying to move up to become an MLO or any other position was met with resistance. No support.

424,"Okay company but bad job","I worked as a customer representative but when I applied I didn't know it was for cold calling, it didn't have that in the description. The job was collecting debt for this bank loans and it's a pretty decent job if you have thick skin. The customers are rude most of the time and treat you like you're not a person. Most managers are understanding of the situation, but collecting debt was just not something I could get into. wasn't getting paid enough to be treated like trash on a daily basis.

427,"Overworked and under-staffed, but benefits for part timers are pretty nice","I work with a good strong team, we get along like family in the branch and my supervisor and manager are both so understanding and supportive and they're honestly a big part of the reason I'm still there. this bank offers no help when we're short staffed due to vacations or illnesses, however, they're very quick to pull from the branch when it benefits someone else. We're considered full staff, but struggle completing required daily/ weekly/ monthly tasks because we're too busy. We're expected to get good surveys, but its hard when customers have to wait in line for long periods of time due to lack of staff and also because this bank expects us to push sales and not rush to get the lines down. Loyalty to the company means nothing, doesn't matter how long you've been with the company, the new people coming in end up making the same as you or more","Teller","Current Employee","Ohio","May 9, 2021","3.0"
428,"Good benefits package, supportive management at branch","As a teller, you are expected to be able to process many complicated transactions while adhering to policies and procedures to minimize risk. That's the easy part. What's hard is the pace.

My career lasted for 8 years, started as a part time teller and ended as a Service and Sales Rep, towards the end of my time, cold calling 100 min. people a week was the rule in order to make sales appointments. High Stress in sales as I'm sure it is at any bank, service was the best part of the job, you really are able to help people reach goals and that feels good. Lots of room for advancement, many co workers moved on to higher titles, 2 weeks paid vacation, 6 paid sick days, and paid holidays.

440,"All depends on the branch","My branch was okay. My coworkers were amazing and my manager genuinely cared. It's all upper management. Corporate doesn't care about you. Pay could be a lot better considering how much you have to put up with. Customers can be very very rude. Expected to meet a call per day and sales quota when they under-staff every branch. Great job if you're okay with small yearly pay increases and small quarterly bonuses if you can sell.
