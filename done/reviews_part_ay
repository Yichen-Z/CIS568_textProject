1203,"Stressful and completely overused","In a management position myself I feel as though I took on more responsibilities with very little compensation. I'm making .50 more than a teller. If I had been aware of the pay I would have never applied to take the position. I literally go home and have nightmares over my workplace environment- not reaching my goals, work being left out, upper management. this bank has affected my personal mental health more than I care to admit, as I know it has done to others, the evidence is all in the incredibly high turnover rate. With all that being said, I love the environment of my branch. My manager is amazing. I would stay forever if it wasn't for the fact it was this bank. Paid time off is great, hours are pretty nice, the consistency of the hours is perfect.

1214,"Branch Sales and Service Representative","I loved my job with this bank. The company seems to truly care about their employees. There is a lot of room for advancement as long as you're willing to move to another branch. A requirement is that you must be really good at sales. The job is basically a sales job and pushing products - you have to be good at that or you won't make it. I did very well with the sales aspect.

1223,"Good Remote Job and Traditional Blend","This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met. Lots of autonomy with getting job done! Products and services of bank are very strong too as this bank leads in several spaces. The people are nice to work with within the retail and commercial branch network but the company is disjointed from its legacy culture in Pittsburgh. The company has restructured incentives to significantly decrease incentive pay. Incentive pay for this role is also dependent on far away teammate performance and not pay for individual performance which can leave the BDO doing double duty to make up for teammate performance if they want a pay-out. There's no remedy for this. There's no real career trajectory outside of retail side of bank. Management skill level for this line of business is below average often resorting to pitting teammates against one another, openly disparaging partner lines of business & individual people. There's a severe lack of emotional IQ, and extreme passive aggressiveness that thwarts productivity and lowers team morale.","OUT OF BRANCH BANKING","Former Employee","Atlanta, GA","September 17, 2019","3.0"

1227,"Okay job, good benefits","Training is ongoing. Very involved duties, training by coworkers. Unfortunately, the training is not conducive to being mentored on the job with your trainer sitting with you, and you are dealing with customers and not completely comprehending how to best assist them.I have been told to 'read the manual' which you have to search a 50+ page binder that is not labelled for easy searching, and if you are totally New to the business, some of the terms used in the manual make understanding difficult.","Treasury Analyst","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","September 15, 2019","3.0"
1228,"Over the top stressful","You were threatened daily of your job being re-evaluated if you did not meet weekly goals. Your were berated and embarrassed in front of employees both face to face and on conference calls. I was in banking for 30 years. I worked at this bank for seven and twenty three at another bank.

Training is awful, management unappreciative and career advancement is hard to get for a management position. a lot of last minute decisions such as an hr long call night announced for personal bankers the night of for after hours.

1231,"Work/life balance","Some positions promise work/life balance but do not follow through. Overtime has become mandatory in some departments because employees just leave due to management and/or department stress.

1235,"Not worth the hype","First off, after taxes and benefits, you're making about $14 an hour, zero overtime, but the managers are salaried so they leave whenever they want throughout the day. They still get paid for it, they'll also make the schedule with them 'working' 41-45 hours, but in reality they work maybe 35. Everyone talks trash about each other, especially upper management, even outside of the bank. Make managers are sexist and harass females, they talk extremely inappropriate, but no one higher than them cares.
