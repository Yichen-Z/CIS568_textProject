2150,"Great place to work."," this bank is an awesome place to work especially for someone fresh out of high school. They pay well for a first time job and in general for that matter. There is plenty of room for advancement and every manager I've had has pushed me to advance. The reason I don't want to work there is that it's not in my line of work, I'm just tired of doing something I didn't go to school to do.","Sales Representative","Current Employee","Kalamazoo","September 6, 2018","4.0"

2160,"Very dependable"," this bank had the usual opportunities of working for a large corporation. Banks are very unstable with mergers and job security. They required a high level of responsibility with very low salary compensation.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Noblesville, IN","September 4, 2018","3.0"
2161,"Productive,pleasent people"," this bank overall is a nice place to work. I do not enjoy the sales aspect of my position that seems to be overtaking the customer service quality . The work life balance is very unbalanced, as we are not allowed a full day off and work six days a week.","Teller Lead","Current Employee","Jacksonville, MD","September 4, 2018","4.0"
2162,"Great work envoirnment","One of the best jobs I had ever had. This company gives you everything you could ask for. Benefits, Work/Life, Competitive compensation. The biggest issue they have is with MANAGEMENT. One bad manager can taint an entire experience, and that tends to happen quite often in this bank, as Managers are often quickly replaced and/or rotated. Consistent management is key to running a good business, and this bank fails to find good managers.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Detroit, MI","September 4, 2018","5.0"
2163,"Very bad work environment","Waiting on customer, processing all their banking needs. Management was not flexible with you for your family life.

2168,"Salary","Two major issues with this bank are; low salary and lack of career advancement. If you live in Pittsburgh, PA where the headquarters is located you have a better chance of advancing your career. However, if you are located in Philadelphia then the company is only an experience mill to help you gain experience for other financial companies. Even if you have a bachelors degree and try to advance from an Analyst I to an Associate I or II your application will be denied, mainly due to the company mainly wanting to hire from the outside and keep salaries low. Personally I like my current job, but my talents are being wasted and management are only interested in making themselves look good. So if you are a newly graduated undergrad this company is a good start to get your foot into the financial door and nothing more.","Implementation Associate I","Current Employee","Philadelphia, PA","September 3, 2018","3.0"

2172,"Do not concider working here","This is a sales position. They are very competitive with their goals; however, the salary sucks. They pay the least of all banks and they will negotiate.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Philadelphia, PA","August 31, 2018","1.0"
2173,"Competetive if you are willing to put the work in","As with all Organizations there is pros and cons. As long as you are dedicated and have the desire to be a Top Performer, the Company is pretty fair in recognizing and awarding your hard work. As with most Branch Manager positions you are responsible for anything and everything. The Company can be more mindful in providing faster and modern technologies to help balance all the spinning plates. FTE and Staffing allocations are slim which can be a challenge in meeting your Customer Service, Production and Coaching/Development of your Team. Also, the Branch Manger is the primarily the Business Banker as well so getting out and prospecting to execute on Business Calls can be tricky if you are not fully staffed and have the right Team in place.","Vice President","Current Employee","Orlando, FL","August 31, 2018","4.0"

2177,"fun workplace with amenities","it was fun because you never knew when this bank would honor the company with little gifts or look at the monthly calendar and see when we would have bagel and banana day. The hardest part was telling the customers that their account had been overdrawn and fees were incurred.","Administrative Assistant","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 29, 2018","5.0"
2178,"Good Company, Hire The Wrong People","Job was good,Coworkers were great Management was not good.

2179,"Good place to work"," this bank really lives the work/life balance culture. They do provide an environment where you are in charge of you own destiny, however that may be due to the large workload/span of control being put on the management team so that they cannot allocate any time to this activity. Compensation process is flawed.","Business Analyst Staff Manager - IT","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 29, 2018","3.0"
2180,"Great place to work.","I enjoyed my time with this bank. It is a well established bank where the company is not in a constant state of reorganization. Roles are well defined and management has a clear direction and expectation.","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Birmingham, AL","August 29, 2018","4.0"
2181,"Employees do not matter","It was very frustrating working at this bank. Anytime a customer got upset or had a disagreement it automatically became the employee's fault. I've been called out my name, cursed out, etc yet every time I was the one who got written up. The manager was never available to help us nor did she ever stick up for her employees. I just had to accept that no one cares about me as an individual. I'm just another employee that is replaceable. After my new manager came in the job was no longer enjoyable. I cried everyday before coming in just because it was a depressing atmosphere.","Assistant Teller Supervisor","Current Employee","Plainfield, NJ","August 28, 2018","1.0"

2183,"Good company to work for but management is terrible."," this bank is a great place to work but it is hard to move upward in your field. There are limited positions availble. At my 2 year mark I asked for a raise or even insight on some job opportunities and I was turned down on both after being praised for all the great work I've done. It might be just my manager, but I definitely does not look good upon the company.","Customer Service Representative","Current Employee","Green, OH","August 28, 2018","4.0"

Management seems to not wont you to better yourself","Branch Financial Sales Consultant I","Former Employee","Cleveland, OH","August 28, 2018","3.0"
2186,"Customer Service"," this bank is a great bank as a customer. They offer all the things retail banking customers are looking for. As an employee, they were great to work for except for compensation. We once had a meeting where the Regional VP was talking about different levels of accounts. He said 'who doesn't have at least $2,000 direct deposits per month in their checking account' (helps avoid monthly fees) and everyone in the training meeting raised their hand was like 'I don't even come close to $2,000/month in direct deposits'. Showed how out of touch management was from their customer facing employees. I believe this bank recently increased their minimum wage, but when I was there, it was below $10/hr. They offer tons of incentives for referrals, but you were lucky to get one or two per day due to the emergence of online banking and most people making the switch from traditional means. Overall great company. Just don't work here if you are the only source of income in your family (more of a supplemental income position or for mom's re-entering the workforce).","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Jarrettsville, MD","August 28, 2018","3.0"

I have learned different processes and procedures that have helped me to grow within the company. The management staff is very supportive in your growth and are very knowledgeable. At this bank they believe that the environment should be pleasant and professional. The hardest part of the job is understanding the needs of the customer and how your products relate to them.
