They leave you in the middle of transactions you don't know how to complete and then blame you for making the mistake when the head teller didn't show you how to complete it. All she did was click things on my computer without showing me how its done and when I asked for help they always had an attitude. I learned about important cash limits 4 months into my employment. The other tellers all did things that violated this bank policies and when I made the mistake I was yelled at when I was just doing what everyone else does due to lack of training. I had a Panic attack in the middle of a transaction because once again they left me with something I wasn't trained in and got yelled at by my manager on why am I crying and why cant I calm down .
