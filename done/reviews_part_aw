1100,"Absolutely stressful environment","I was as a QA test lead in this bank(TCoE). I am going to tell you my experience with this bank and it's just my subjective opinion. Onboarding and off boarding process is awful, no KT or directing new employee to the right work flow. It is imposible to find any documentation related to the project. Poor weak hardware laptop is proveded for automation with Windows 7 (later upgrated to 10) system which is glitching periodicaly. Scrum master's answer is 'I don't know' for any question. Management system is in very unprofessional level and not orgonized. Developers' manager doesn't understand overall concepts of developing and hiring devs with backend background for frontend project. A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing, more truly, they come to have their lunch, drink coffee/tea, and wash their dishes afterall. There is no proper environment for testing, everything should be tested in devs' machine which is unstable and available from time to time. So many mess is in whole Sprint duration. Releases are constantly postponed due to other dependencies. this bank's new up to date web application cannot emerge because of all these kind of issues in management. If you try to open this bank web app you will see old design which is even not responsive. I wonder whether the stakeholders aware about the lame this bank application. I can continue to criticize every detail of this bank working process for a long time but want to say this bank manager could fire employee for no reason even everything is done on time and properly. Instead of appreciation employee could get fired or get stress.","TCoE test lead","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","November 18, 2019","1.0"

1103,"West orange northfield branch management was the worst","I've been in the career of banking for roughly 6 years. I've NEVER experienced such poor leadership in my life to compare to the one in this branch. I've never had a manager tell me to my face 'the business comes before you' when I express a concern of lack of work/life balance in the workplace. Due to my recent life event changes of me having to move to a different state, I applied to this bank. When I arrived to my interview 15 minutes early we'll prepared after driving for 2 hours from my hotel to get there, I was told to wait an additional 30 minutes after my scheduled time because she wasn't ready. The branch manager was completely unprofessional. She told me she's 'stretching the interview longer' within 10 minutes of the interview by adding unnecessary conversation because i told her of my drive time. On my drive back, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job after I clear for drug testing. Flash forward to me actually working at the West Orange, NJ branch... I was expected to work 6 days a week (some leave the branch at 7pm some nights)M-S, wear a suit, reach high sales goals, be a banker, be a teller... etc. The job is do-able. But when management is constantly over your shoulder, throwing mini tantrums when things don't go her way, disrespecting her colleagues... it makes you not want to come to work. After I wasn't told lunch breaks were 45 minutes not an hour, I had the manager CALL ME WHEN IM OFF THE CLOCK 50 minutes into my break to ask me to come back in. There's no space. And the fact that management didn't allow me to continue doing training & jump into - more...","Universal Banker","Former Employee","West Orange, NJ","November 17, 2019","1.0"

They all expect you to not only help them hit their goals, but also attend numerous sales meetings (virtual and in person) that are generally not helpful. They are closing Branches, yet direct any customers with problems encountered from phone/ email contact to their local Branch. Not a bad culture, but they expect miracles with thin staffing.

The assistant managers are not well trained in how they can manage others of all backgrounds and cultures in addition to not being dependable. The pay should also be increased for the amount of paper work that is done within a branch atmosphere. Why does a billion dollar company use so much paper?
