I ordered checks and debit cards, helped in locating a local ATM near their location. I participated in their program that assisted blind callers in the use of an ATM machine. I assisted in the training of the new hire financial service consultants, I also did take escalated calls from customers whom needed to speak with a supervisor when a supervisor might not be available.","Sr Financial service representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 15, 2017","4.0"

3404,"My review","It's a good job but you work your butt off and you don't get what you deserve, I'm a full time student and sacrifice so much for my job. I wanted to get a promotion and was told that I wasn't good enough. My job is stressful because I took on a lot of responsibility and management still didn't care. In order to move up in the company you have to kiss everyone's butt.","Universal Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Florence, KY","August 14, 2017","3.0"
3405,"Normal Bank day","I love working for this bank, if it wasn't for the managers themselves I would never want to leave. Although the hours are long (8am to 6pm) I still enjoyed myself while at work. The hardest part is working with the managers who do not care about anyone but themselves. I've made life long friends besides that, and it makes the work day go by quickly.","Teller","Current Employee","pittsburgh","August 14, 2017","3.0"
3406,"Web set our own goals and it was up to us to achieve them.","We had a fun group to work with. The building had a cafeteria which was convenient for lunches and snacks. We used our computer to sign in our start time and would log out for breaks, meetings, etc. The job was not hard, you just had to pay attention to detail when logging in information in the data bases as other departments depend on the information to do their jobs.","Mortgage Loan Clerk","Former Employee","Brecksville, Oh","August 14, 2017","5.0"
3407,"Great Opportunities for Advancement"," this bank is a great company to start a career at. The managers will work with you to make sure you are getting into the line of business that you want to work in. They have plenty of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort. Your day varies based on the position you are in. We have branches, call centers, out of branch sales and multiple other lines of business. The culture is very friendly, I have always enjoyed the environment created by my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job is the amount of goals set for someone to accomplish, it can be overwhelming, at the same time extremely motivating. There is always something to work on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created within the workplace and with the customers.","MULTI CHANNEL SALES ASSOCIATE I","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","August 14, 2017","5.0"

3409,"Decent pay but job duties were overwhelming","It was nice pay but the amount of work and training you go through without more pay is quite extensive. The grading scale is quite outrageous as well depending on who is monitoring your calls. Some are lenient some are extremely over bearing and unrealistic.","Loan Servicing Specialist II","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 14, 2017","3.0"

3411,"Great Room for Growth"," this bank has a great flexible schedule that allows me to work my job around my everyday activities.

3412,"Big Bank with Good Culture","I really enjoyed working here. The corporate culture was much better than the average bank and the work environment was good. It felt more fun than the average bank, and the customers recognized it. However, pay wasn't good compared to other banks.","Financial Sales Consultant","Former Employee","Oaklyn, NJ","August 13, 2017","5.0"
3413,"I was only there 3 months as a contractor","I was under contract for a Lender Transformation project. The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and helpful when I needed assistance.

3415,"It was a very challenging environment to work.","Highly regulated work environment and the level of expectations by the management was high. Highly sales-oriented and competitive industry where I learned to become efficient tackling multiple tasks at the same time.

3416,"Not bad at all"," this bank is a great bank to work for. My position doesn't get paid enough, but for right now, it's good. Was a banker before I went to our operations department.

3417,"Somewhat stressful, high-pressure environment with benefits that can pay off","Any bank is going to be high-pressure. this bank as a corporation does a nice job of providing compensation, benefits, and perks to make up for this. However, I found that the high emphasis on driving sales really affected the work environment, to the point where it was emphasized over customer service - especially when upper management came to visit the branch. The corporate business model really made it hard to focus on what the job was all about - even down to the teller position.","Teller","Former Employee","NJ","August 11, 2017","4.0"
3418,"Hard to go into everyday","They tell you not to be a product pusher but lay a set number of what they call 'expectations' on you to meet per quarter, which makes you a product pusher if you want to meet them. If you do not meet these 'expectations' it affects your ability to move up within the company and also raises. Policies and rules constantly change and there is rarely anyone, including managers, who have the right info to give you. There is a survey system that is random and anonymous that asks customers questions based on your interaction, if they even remember it was you, it is very unfair that also determines if you receive pay raises and your ability to advance in the company. I've received bad surveys from customers due to their bad interactions with a different employee all because they survey is anonymous on who the employee was, and it is almost impossible to come back from a bad survey. The maternity leave is awesome, 16 weeks of 100% pay, which honestly is the only reason I stayed with the company for my final months.","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Rockford, IL","August 11, 2017","1.0"

Great advancement opportunities for sharp, hard-working individuals. Must be able to operate in a complex regulatory environment, but training is generally available - though much of it is self-directed. Probably the best of the big banks to work for. Key skills that will advance your career include strong verbal and written communications, negotiating, and interpersonal skills.

3436,"Absolutely horrible","1 isn't even close to a low enough rating: this bank is the worst company I have ever worked for. I had 2 years of banking (at another institution) when I came to this bank & they wouldn't even match the salary I STARTED with at the other institution. Management is a JOKE. They truly have no say in anything that goes on. The goals are attainable, but always changing, making it difficult to be consistent. The expectations are unrealistic, & again, always changing. There is no reward or recognition for ANYTHING. They do not care about their employees or the customer, all they care about are numbers. If you are going into a company looking to advance, this is NOT the place to do it. They require you to be in your current position for a year, they run your credit for any positions you apply for (even promotions within), your goals have to be well beyond what is expected of you, and you have to actually have a manger that cares about your development (DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH).. I could go on forever.. but if you like the shiny perks they hold in front of your face & you're willing to sell your soul, you'll be just fine! Side note: don't get too comfortable in your position, they will surely displace you. 400+ jobs this year alone.","Teller","Former Employee","Ohio","August 7, 2017","1.0"

3442,"Good company, could pay more","Advancement opportunities are present, however, the pay increase has a low cap. The opposite is true of talent brought in from outside.
