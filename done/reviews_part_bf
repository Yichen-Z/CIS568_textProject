1550,"Fair Enough","The people who work at this bank are what makes it great. It's a shame that the organization doesn't put more value on their human capital. Instead of reporting their billions of net gain every quarter, maybe they should work on fair pay for all their employees.","Client Service Specialist","Current Employee","Baltimore, MD","May 14, 2019","4.0"
1551,"Great to learn all the different loan types","Nothing positive to say about them. It was a great opportunity to learn the mortgage business however this bank had a lot of Racist and friend based promotions on the operation end of the business. On the servicing end of the business it was more diverse.","Loan Processor","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 14, 2019","1.0"
1552,"Okay place to work","It seems with this company if you do less than your job is described you are bowed down to.

1555,"Great place to work, management is not where it should be.","I love my job. The pay was great and the benefits weren't that bad either. The job lacked management and consistency.

1556,"None","Nothing good to say about this bank. No work life balance.

1558,"Stressful...tellers are forced to sell products","I liked being a teller, however this bank forces tellers to push products on every single customer, even those you would see ever day. Tellers should be able to provide customer service, not pushing products the customers don't ask for or want. To this day I have flashback nightmares of my manager criticizing our work. For this they paid a full time teller 9$ an hour. Benefits were good, as they should be at a large company. Every day we had a morning meeting on performance, what to push to customers, and this bank calls customers for feedback on employee performance and if you got less than 5 out of 5 you were not doing good enough. Also, as a teller, we had to cold call customers after work periodically to sell them financial services.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Chestertown, MD","May 13, 2019","1.0"
1559,"Benefits"," this bank provides opportunities to grow in your career and benefits to support the initiative.

1565,"Great Pay, Amazing boss","I was a Loan Closer with this bank I loved my boss, she did not micromanage, and she was encouraging. The pay I received while I was there was a good pay rate per hour. Job security however leaved much to be desired, they would cut anyone and everyone at the drop of a dime. They would not even offer other positions within the company before getting rid of you. Other than that it was a good experience.","Senior Loan Processor","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 9, 2019","3.0"
1566,"Good workplace","Direct managers are wonderful to work with. My manager takes an active interest in my development with my career and me personally.

1567,"Horrible","Pros: - My co-workers was the main reason why I didn't leave right away. They were nice and helpful. Cons: - Management was a mess. We didn't have a manager for 6+ months. - The branch that I worked at was very busy and under-staffed. - Always running out of supplies. For instance, deposit and withdrawal slips, pens, cups, etc. - No paid time off for part-time until you've worked there for a year. - They'll also fire if you do one thing wrong without any warnings.

1569,"Stay away from this bank!","I have worked in the mortgage industry for 20 years. And this was the worst experience of my entire career. this bank is unethical and lack any sense of moral compass. The way they treat their employees is actually illegal. And several ex-employees have filed lawsuits against the company. Stay far far away from this bank.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Moorestown, NJ","May 4, 2019","1.0"
1570,"Sales not Management","Position in store (Giant). Long hours, typically short staffed. Focus was on sales, approaching shopping customers, ridiculous activities in front of branch to stop Giant customers. Emphasis on selling instead of employee development or customer service. Massive pressure from upper management to meet sales goals. If you are looking for a respectable banking job this it NOT it.","Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager","Former Employee","VA","May 3, 2019","1.0"
1571,"Im Surprised they are still in business","There is so much to say about my experience with this company but to sum it up. The company does not set you up for success at all. I personally did succeed but at the cost of my health physically and mentally. The training does absolutely nothing to prepare you for the actually job. The 1-2 week training basically just shows you the systems you will be working with. THATS IT. For the 3 years I was there management changed the processes about twice a month; sometimes more. I am all for being flexible with change but it was just ridiculous after a while. On top of it they want you to keep up with every wishy washy change they made and reprimand you for every mistake. Every day I felt like I may lose my job if I'm not perfect. The company also changed the incentive structure every year to make it more difficult to bonus. I was a Processor and there were just so many things outside out control, but we got blamed for every thing that happened. I would never recommend anyone work here and I will never work for them again. I honestly feel the company as a whole did not care about their customers and every decision they made was a guess. they have all these kind of special projects testing out new processes or systems but when it comes down to implementing real feed back they don't listen to the people who actually do the job every day. Also, as an employee so many managers have favorites.","Senior Loan Processing Analyst","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 2, 2019","2.0"
1572,"Avoid the this bank aml department at all cost!","I worked for this bank as an AML Investigator in the Pittsburgh office (1st Side Center) for a number of years. I've also had similar titles at another bank and have been a professional in Risk Management for over a decade. At first, I thought the work culture was friendly and the program seemed fairly organized. The department was expanding its AML program considerably and hiring more investigators and support staff to handle a large increase in case volume. Within six months, they had the new hires working 12+ hours a day and were expected to handle case volumes far beyond what the vast majority of people could handle. During the worst of it, you were expected to clear about 10-16 case in a week. From what I was told, prior to the case increases and hiring push, investigators were expected to work between 5-8 cases a week. There were a few dips in the case volume moving forward but largely the average that you would work in a given month increased as time when by. All the while, there was little or no improvements to the policies and procedures that would help us do the work faster and with more efficiency. In other words, you were expected to do a lot more with less. this bank tries to solve any problem by hiring more managers. The most frustrating part about working there is most of the Team Leads and Managers are absolutely terrible and all they care about are metrics. Some of the stuff I've heard managers say I can honestly say I've never come across in my entire professional life. It was like living in a cult. The Team Leads there may have been good at clearing - more...","AML Investigator","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 2, 2019","1.0"
1573,"Schedule Adherence","Don't do it unless you have no kids, don't get sick, running late by 1 min!!! Schedule adherence is unrealistic if you are stuck on a call during your 15 minutes you risk being off your adherence and no bonus they give you! You get the same calls all day sometimes from the same folks with their online banking system causing customers to be locked out multiple times a week and there is no script to follow.

1578,"Green company but low pay","Average employer, not much can be really said about the front line.

1582,"Tactical, next flashy thing management style","Management is engrained in the tactical day to day operations and has no vision or strategy. Management speaks of work/life balance as something that will come in the years to come if we work hard today. It takes 4-5 months to get an approved work effort approved to begin. So after getting approval, you have another 4-5 months of getting approvals before you can begin.","Operations Specialist","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","April 23, 2019","2.0"

I learned money management skills and the genesis data base along with being NMLS certified. Management was not encouraging and pushed sales goals on you everyday. Hardest part of my job was not being able to make important decisions. It all had to go through the manager and cooperate.
