Working in treasury management, employees typically are in the office 40 hours / week with the flexibility to work from home as needed. Projects are interesting and expansive as the company is a full service bank. Advancement occurs fluidly but salary often doesn't follow as quickly.

888,"Run from them","This place is a joke. I've worked here for 15 years. Hard working loyal employee. I'm now actively looking for another job, should have done it years ago but I kept expecting them to figure it out and do the right thing. They literally give you a pay decrease after factoring in inflation year on year even with exceeds expectations or better and sometimes none at all. Their managers are told to average out 1 to 2 percent increases for everyone and will move you and your managers evaluation of you lower to fit that (not just in pay but performance). They do nothing for the good of the employee beyond what they are guilted into via industry pressures or PR. The decisions they make are short sighted. HR and incompetency has convinced them they don't need to actually pay employees. 1+ BILLION in pure profit a quarter (that's 4 times a year) for over a decade in a row and they don't pay their employees at all. It's astounding and incredible to me this is allowed to occur. It's unethical, immoral, and corrupt. I don't say these things lightly. It hurts. I've worked there for a long time.
