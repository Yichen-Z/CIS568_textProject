504,"Most of your coworkers are good people and very knowledgeable","Good place to start a career. You will have to move on though as they do not compensate well. Upper management will tell you in order to get a raise you need a job offer for them to match. That will however be the biggest and possibly the only raise you get. They like to say they have great benefits but they are comparable and usually less than what's offered at other banks.","Treasury Management Commercial Card Technical Consultant","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 22, 2021","3.0"
505,"Only concerned about the bottom line. Employees are drones.","No chance of advancement if you aren't a minority. The culture is so 'inclusive' that there is no equal opportunity.

506,"High Stress, Low Pay","There is not a good work-life balance at this bank. I am constantly working through lunch breaks and past my scheduled shift. The workload and responsibilities of this role are not compensated on a fair basis. You will be expected to take on an excessive amount of work with little to no training. I have constantly been lied to regarding raises, workload, and career progression throughout my time with this bank. Managers are scheduled in meetings all day and are not supportive. Upper management has no idea what is actually going on for front-line employees, yet they are the ones that dictate the processes and systems we use. There is also a large disconnect among different internal departments with no departments wanting to claim ownership for work and other issues. This ultimately will fall back on my role to take care because we have the most contact with the customers. This requires us to work on issues and research solutions that we don't have the tools for, all on top of our normal workload. You will find yourself working well outside of the job description with little to no extra incentives with this bank. Fully expect to be lied to regarding pay progression, career progression, and workload when working for this bank. If you absolutely need a job it's fine but don't work more than the bare minimum and don't plan on making a career here.

507,"Good company to work for. Depending on what position you are in."," this bank as a company is good to work for. Be careful which position you chose. If your position involves sales be prepared for an overview of every move you make, Lots of cold calls (they don't consider it cold calling since they are clients but trust me they don't want the calls), and meetings everyday cutting into the time you need to make those calls.

508,"Very Hostile Job Environment","This is not a good place to work. this bank Hires more managers/supervisory roles than actual workers but the managers do not support those reporting to them. If a manager feels threatened, they will do everything they can to make your life miserable while you are still in the department, but then still try to block you when posting out to another group. They claim they provide raises and bonuses but that doesn't really happen. The amount the company raises payroll deductions for health benefits each year does is more than the minimal 1 to 2% pay increase each year. So even though your gross pay goes up, your take home barely moves due to these increases. There are plenty more Financial Service Companies out there, I suggest you look somewhere else.","AML Risk specialist III","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","February 19, 2021","1.0"

510,"Back to back phone calls and crunched on time","While the pay and benefits are decent and there is paid time off, the job itself is quite stressful with panicked and stressed out customers calling in, often with complex banking issues. Since going virtual, management seems to have no time and they treat you like a customer. When trying to help the customer, prioritizing a positive customer experience and ensuring first call resolution and financial well being will make it impossible to meet your stats, including average handle time and hold time. You only get 3 minutes daily to fill out paperwork and notes on customer accounts, otherwise are told to complete it with the customer on the line. You will get written up if they find you haven't put notes in the account, and its important to do so anyway for communication purposes, but they simply make it impossible to do. Co-workers from other departments often have good intentions but are limited on time trying to meet their own stats and so there is an underlying coldness that permeates interactions with one another. There are many positive aspects to this job including benefits and the way you can call in sick or schedule vacation is very independent, you don't need to tell your boss any personal details, just that you won't be in.You just call the call off line. The sent beautiful flowers to my brothers funeral when I had to call in to attend the funeral, which was incredibly caring. There are a lot of resources for a wide range of things, as long as you know where to look.

But expect Ohio salary, regardless of where you live","I would recommend this bank because from management down to the line, you can tell the company cares about people.However, they are a bank. Nickel-and-dime is what they do best. And salaries are no exception. Although I was able to negotiate a salary commensurate with where I live, I was never able to get a salary raise as the base salary for a big metro area like NYC or DC is far higher than the top earners in the Cleveland, Ohio/Pittsburgh PA market, where most of staff are based.The politics and diversity (lack there of) mimics the state of the nation. Expect nothing different there. The one thing I can say is that women are empowered at this bank and they are very much in leadership positions every where you look.Some areas adopt change and are forward thinking and adapt modern practices. Other areas or groups are stuck in mimicking older banks. There are enough of those pockets of teams that really slow down progress.","Vice President","Current Employee","Remote","February 14, 2021","4.0"

They expect you to make a sale with every customer that comes in and you are cold calling customers during your down time that want nothing to do with you. Training was awful as instructors never actually showed you how to do anything. We were also consistently under-staffed during my time there so we always worked six days a week. You are consistently micromanaged by your manager and after every customer you are criticized for not making a sale and instead of coaching and training the manager would just tell me what I did wrong and would consistently talk bad behind employees backs.

Amazing Diversity & Inclusion program as well with local and national EBRG chapters in addition to regional councils to ensure our activities within our communities are perfectly in line with our values as an organization. The leadership truly believes in improving financial literacy and demonstrates it through many philanthropic efforts across the US. During the pandemic, while every bank was reducing cost, this bank invested by creating an entire division within the commercial bank dedicated to organizational financial wellness. Base pay I would say is very fair and bonuses have both a set and discretionary component. Very good health plan benefits with HSA, 401k and Pension.

533,"Fake work life balance","This place promotes work life balance but doesn't actually allow employees to have a life outside of work. Management expects employees to work almost every weekend and most nights. Also, it is impossible to get any actual work done because meetings are scheduled throughout the entire day. So if you want to get any real work done, you have to work after hours. Management does not trust their employees' knowledge and the management consistently does the opposite of what is recommended.

534,"Compensation and Culture are low.","Visit onsites and promote this banks products. Open accounts onsite outside of branches. You must have a good team leader if you want to enjoy this role. Management attributed to a very toxic 'team' environment. Often inciting competition, gossip and slander as a form of 'motivation' and influence. I went on medical leave and when I came back, my position was switched by my direct manager to a floater position where I had to drive 2 hours to get to any onsites. Spoke to HR and nothing could be done. The decision did not make success in my role conducive since most of my time was spent driving. My advice when working here: Don't get sick, don't seek surgery to get well or you may not have your position to come back to. Also, this is a dead end role even if you are a rock star with your goals. Many of my team members have been in this role for years (as much as 13 years) and have not gotten promoted or considered.

Personally, the quality of my customer interactions took priority over my own metrics, which became a topic of conversation during personal coaching meetings. However, my experience with this bank as a company, was very positive. The environment was always supportive, inclusive, and motivating. There were many resources available to all employees within the call center such as resume workshops, public speaking and leadership groups, and career corner opportunities (where you can learn more about other careers within the call center). this bank also had a comprehensive benefits package (including health/life/vision/dental insurance, 14 days of PTO given each calendar year, occasional VTO offered, up to 6 paid sick days, HSA, ISP 401k, FMLA, pension plan, home buying assistance, employee specific APRs on credit cards/loans, separate rooms within call center for nursing mothers, etc.).

High turnover rate, and extremely under-staffed branches. Most of the time you have so much work, that you will leave something 'hanging', and most likely will be called out for it.
