The computer systems are 'pre-historic' - and have not been updated in over 20 years. A task that would take 5 mins in a modern bank like Wells Fargo or BOA, takes hours here.

2363,"I don't recommend taking a position as a Financial Advisor at this bank","I worked in the and was completely mislead about the position I was hired for. They tell you that you will be busy all the time with daily appointments set by the branches. The turnover rate for new employees in that Segment is 100% annually.

2372,"BSSA/Manager","The company overall has many opportunities for community involvement if presented to you by upper management. I worked there through many changes throughout the company. As the company shifted so did the management. The work environments were stressful. The days were long and the staffing was short. If you didn't email the proper chain and save those emails to back up what you needed help with or to keep abreast on the expectations no one stood up if there was a fire within the branch. Loss prevention should be more hands on in training staff properly. After the Wells Fargo scandal we were told to back off selling. Once the heat died down the pressure was on. You felt like your job was on the line every day. Rather being meeting sales goals or being an octopus by doing your job and everyone else's. There's no team work or comradery in this organization. If your not a puppet you don't matter.","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Baltimore, MD","June 28, 2018","2.0"

2381,"Moderate Risk Financial Institution Traditionally Known to Value Its Employees","Good 'community bank' feel with stability of a large institution. Does the right things for customers and most of the time for its employees as well. Mid-management lacks leadership and mentorship skills, mostly are top operators that needed an avenue for higher pay. Improved management training needed. Overall a good and stable company for high performers and low performers alike. Not an 'up or out' company, if you are a low performer, just stick to your lane and you'll have a happy and long career. Top performers are well rewarded but need to remain nimble to align self with the most current and relevant leaders to survive. Very lax work environment. Friendly workforce that is very tolerant. Appreciates diversity. Remote and flex work schedule friendly / encouraged. Acceptable benefits structures.","Strategy Planning Business Analysis Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","June 26, 2018","4.0"
2382,"Stressful goal environment","I was found by a recruiter through the company, and was very excited to start. Offered benefit right away, and acceptable pay. Remberced for any travel expenses and mileage used for work and training. They provide lots of trainings as well. Be ware, SO MANY GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS. Be prepared to be HOUNDED if you are even A LITTLE behind on goal. If a client doesn't not want a sale, YOU WILL get the backlash because management assumes you are not selling it right. They also promote life and family but if you are full time you can work a 6 day week! 30 minute lunches (not long enough) You have to use paid time to be off, you can't just take off and it makes work life balance hard.","Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Maryland","June 25, 2018","3.0"
2383,"not a good bank for customer or employee","Worked in a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door. On top of that, this bank does everything in it's power to keep customers out of the branch because it's cheapest checking account requires customers to do all their business through the ATM or they will receive a monthly fee. this bank does not do right by their tellers; they do most of the work in the branch, assume all the liability (any bad check will cost you your job), and are expected to reach unrealistic sales goals on a skeleton staff. Go into a this bank, it will be empty but for one or two tellers max and their drive thru lines will most likely be shut down as well. Also I've never seen a company more intent on cramming social justice warrior nonsense down the throats of their employees on a weekly basis as this bank. They will bombard you with emails and on the internal webpage pushing this agenda and are quick to fire any employee who even slightly objects to their 'shared vision' on these issues.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Wilmington, NC","June 25, 2018","1.0"
