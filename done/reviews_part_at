952,"Be forewarned about meeting ticket quotas","The main emphasis in the IT group is to complete as many work request tickets as possible, otherwise you are out the door. Regardless if the work ticket is extremely detailed or very simple, they are focused on the number of tickets you complete during the course of a days work. The ones who are judging you have no concept of how detailed the work requests can be, and make the ultimate decision that you are gone. Not a professional work environment. Be warned!","Database Administrator","Former Employee","Remote","January 21, 2020","2.0"
953,"Mostly fun workspace, but can get stressful","The overall environment of this bank is pretty laid back, but sometimes meeting numbers along with all other responsibilities can seem impossible and quite stressful, especially when they keep changing or adding more and more! I would recommend it as a short-term workplace. It pays well and has great benefits, but I would not necessarily recommend it as a longtime career if you aren't a work-a-holic!","Teller","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","January 21, 2020","4.0"

955,"Regional Bank Technology stack with the desire to be the next 'Big Bank'","The people at this bank are their best asset, but their technology leaves much to be desired. The best part of the job is being able to work from home, but even though they tout being 'inclusive', leadership makes decision without input from staff. Poor overall communication.","Software Manager","Current Employee","Columbus, OH","January 20, 2020","3.0"

960,"Be warned"," this bank is a place you may not want to consider. Stressful nights to meet efficiency goals, while not making any errors. 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch that doesn't give you enough time to get something to eat and relax.

962,"Don't do it!","I never felt more about place in my life. this bank always has openings in the Fayetteville area because people quit, it's hard to get promoted. Management only worries about how many credit cards you get everyday. Regional manager will do 'training on the spot' in front of your coworkers and not give any sort of constructive feedback. Be aware that if you work for this region your personal life will be expected to put on second, business is always first. Vacation time will be approved if and only Reginal Manager approves it.","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Fayetteville, NC","January 16, 2020","1.0"
963,"you cannot trust anyone","I worked for this bank for 5 years. The regional manager made everyone miserable. If she did not like you you were marked to get fired. I was harassed. Eventually, the manager asked me to input a clients ID to issue new debit card even though the client did not have his ID with him, because we 'KNEW' him as a customer. I was reluctant but at the managers insistence issued him a new debit card anyway. Of course I was then fired.

964,"this bank is. GREAT company to work for."," this bank is a Great Company to work for, but the upper management with the Atlanta base lockbox leaves the site open to untrustworthy managers.

970,"Avoid This Position","The people in this position are horrible.. They tell you are able to ask questions if you need help and then when you do you are told by the manager that the people don't know your job because they are separate divisions within this job. The manager and team lead are just wishy washy and backstabbing people!","Image Specialist","Former Employee","Cleveland, OH","January 15, 2020","1.0"
971,"Stressful","As a customer service rep, you take an average of 50 70+ calls per day. The calls are back to back with little to no down time. You do have managers and supervisor with you during every shift, but at times it can be difficult to get a hold of one of them to assist with you during your call. You are rated and scored with each call that can make assisting customers somewhat stressful, because they don't want you on each call too long but what the customers needs met. It is a very stressful balancing act with each situation. There is on going training and team meetings that you need to attend. The team meetings are not long enough to cover all the questions that other team members may have for clarification to assist customer efficiently.","Support Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 14, 2020","2.0"

973,"Overall","Overall this bank is an awesome company and cares genuinely about the employees. The managers are HORRIBLE . And not just one or two I have networked with a lot of different branch managers and have seen how different managers manage there teams. They are NOT team players AT all. They only care about themselves and their results and they expect you to do your job and theirs. this bank have different opportunities as far as promotion and advancement but manager are envious of employees that excel better than them.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Illinois","January 14, 2020","3.0"

975,"Corporate bullish!$","The higher ups at this bank only care about customer satisfaction, and making money. They say they are not like other big banks but that is not true. High pay isn't worth it. Taking a pay cut to seek other employment. There are surveys that go out to customers, that can make or break your bonuses. There's been times we've received bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry they can't get their way, and it's tanked our bonuses that we received and earned. They want you to kiss every customers butt and they do it at the expense of their employees. The pay is great but that's the only thing and they use that as means to secure you in the job.","Services Representative","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","January 14, 2020","1.0"

980,"this bank seems to lack a corporate culture that promotes the inclusion and advancement of blacks and latinos."," this bank, especially in the Greater Philadelphia market, must do a better job of recruiting, developing and promoting black people. Implicit bias is a company wide challenge the needs to be addressed in a deliberate and focused way. In a majority minority city like Philadelphia it seems odd that there are so few senior and executive leaders of color, in particular black people in meaningful leadership roles where they can make hiring/firing decisions.","Relationship Manager","Former Employee","1600 Market St.","January 11, 2020","3.0"
