5101,"Loves to Hire Within!","I have been with this bank for almost 4 years, and I have been promoted two different times since being hired. this bank recognizes great work ethic, relationship builders, and someone who really believes in the mission of the company. Being in a Management position currently, I would say the hardest part of my job is when other branches need help and we have to send an employee to their branch for the day. This creates inconsistency and we lose that employee's engagement by sending them all over the place. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers every day and helping my employees develop and grow within the company.","Assistant Branch Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","June 30, 2015","5.0"

5105,"The life of finance","Going to work everyday was a joy for me. Not only did I love what I did, but I loved being able to help others and not just myself on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job would of have to be that sometimes you have to accept the fact that you cannot help everybody. Sometimes there are things out of your control in life and you just have to accept that fact. The most enjoyable part of my job working as a customer service representative was that when I was able to help others I was not only helping them, but I was supporting there decisions and making sure that they knew that when something went wrong that I was there to help them the best that I could. Also, I loved working there because you could help people plan for their futures. Far and wide. You could help people. Even around the world. You will never see them or talk to them again after that call ends, but in the end you knew that you helped that person the best that you could.

5109,"Fun workplace with lot of training to keep you updated","A typical day at work involves planning sales activities, assisting customers with account opening, holding in-depth conversation with customers to identify their financial needs and completing Teller transactions. That aspect of in-depth conversation with customers and valuing their business is something worthy of mentioning. Customers are always top priority. Typically, getting promoted takes longer period, averagely 4 years. Benefit/compensation program is not the best in the industry. Colleagues and management are friendly and fun to work with. If you're a starter in banking, then I recommend. But if you're looking at better compensation and quick promotions, then you're are looking in the wrong direction. There's high attrition rate probably due to compensation and other factors earlier mentioned. But overall, I think it's fun place to start a career.","Senior Financial Sales Consultant","Current Employee","Alexandria, VA","June 28, 2015","3.0"
