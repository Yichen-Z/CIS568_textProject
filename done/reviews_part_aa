1,"Great place to work for most","I have really enjoyed working here, the only issue is in career advancement. There are some traditional routes that work for some, but anything outside the norm is extremely difficult no matter what level of performance or participation you have.","Branch Sales and Service Associate II","Current Employee","Ann Arbor, MI","March 27, 2019","4.0"
2,"It's a job","You go in five days a week do what you need to then leave, the employees are jerks, and the manager does nothing to keep them from being one. If the employees were more respectful it would be a decent place to work.","Cook","Current Employee","San Antonio, TX","June 2, 2022","3.0"
3,"Stressful","Banking as a whole has become an awful industry to work in. Large corporations still using old school tactics to bring in sales. Corporate yuppies don't understand that pounding pavement to attract sales is not an effective sales method. Furthermore, the manager is tied up in meetings all day that get in the way of managing, which leaves little time to get anything done. ","Branch Manager","Former Employee","Florida","June 1, 2022","2.0"
4,"Micromanaged and very little room for growth","I worked for this bank for about 10 years and every stop was a non existent budget for raises, positions that continue to expand with compensation to match. Find a better company if growth and development are your thing.","Executive Client Relations","Former Employee","OH","June 1, 2022","3.0"
5,"Stressful environment ","Core service consultant. This place is essentially a phone factory where management offers little assistance and expects associates to take back to back phone calls all day.","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","June 1, 2022","1.0"
6,"Productive ","It is a good place to work with management who cares to see you succeed. Some banks micro manage but this one doesn't. this bank also really cares about your benefits ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Dallas, TX","May 30, 2022","5.0"
7,"Every year they cut your pay","Every year they expect you to work 20% harder for 20% less. There is no future of growth for you as an MLO. Management makes poor decisions, but you as the employee shoulder the burden for it. They don't hire the staff when the market is hot, and they then overcompensate by hiring too much, and don't see the market changing. Currently, their idea of fixing the market downturn is for you to call dead end phone numbers of existing customers in their data base. Then the Master Plan is to automate MLOs out of their jobs as much as possible to assure future cuts in MLO pay.","Sr Mortgage Loan Originator","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","May 29, 2022","2.0"
8,"I learned a lot on the job It was a good experience."," Working the evening shift was a plus for me at the time I worked in their corporate office working on various bank documents. This helped me learn more about how the banking business worked, more about how checks and other items were recorded and verified. I learned how the bank process is handled. I had no problem with My manager or supervisor. The workplace was culture. The job was easy nothing was hard about the Job. Working as a team player and keeping busy. ","Data Entry Clerk","Former Employee","8800 Tinicum Blvd. Phila.PA. 19153","May 28, 2022","4.0"
9,"I have a lot to say about this company but it's pointless â€¦","poor management and your work like balance is never going to be 'a balance ' but I'm just one person but this bank isn't all bad /amazing benefit are good .","Teller Representative","Current Employee","Port Saint Lucie, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
10,"Worst place to work","No work life balance. Outdated systems. Extreme Micromanaging. They watch you by cameras and then open investigations based on assumptions. You don't have control over your branch and no ability to waive fees for good clients! If you need to step out of the branch and have worked over 40 hours they still make you use your occasional absence! The Regional Manager could not even understand that goes against Florida Law! this bank wants you to just be a micromanaging robot! Clients are just another person and they say they are about relationship building but their actions do not show it! I received a job offer for 20k more with a much better Financial Institution that truly values their employees and clients! ","Sr Branch Manager","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 27, 2022","1.0"
11,"It'll do, but it kind of sucks","When I started at this bank I was really excited and energized. I had heard a lot about the opportunities this bank offers. That part is true, they have a lot of different departments you can train in and growth opportunities. The downside is you do have to stay an entire year in your current position before you can apply for a different one. So if you hate the area you're working in you better be able to suck it up for 12 months. They do their best to have life/work balance and are big on employees quality of life. However, if you work in a physical branch, you will not be trained. I moved from the care center to the branch and was put in an office for 4 months to train myself. I made countless mistakes every single day due to lack of resources and training. They use outdated software that is extremely hard to navigate and crashes constantly. I got fired for something small, it was my fault, but a writeup may have been a good first step as I had never had a red mark. The people I worked with were great but you could tell how much they hated their jobs. The end of my career with this bank I was extremely burned out and stressed. If you want to be overworked and work 6 days a week twice a month, this bank would be for you. ","Banker","Former Employee","Paw Paw, MI","May 26, 2022","2.0"
12,"Productive, inclusive but lacks work life balance","Everyone does their share here although some managers believe in micromanaging. You only have to stay in each position for a year and you can move around and apply for a new position as much as you would like. My only 2 complaints are with the pay; while they increased the base pay for all positions, positions like tellers supervisors and people who are both bankers and tellers have sales requirements but receive no sales pay. Also the hours are getting worse it makes work life balance hard for those who have small children. Maternity, 401k, stock options, and tuition reimbursement along with other benefits are great.","Lead Teller","Current Employee","Delaware","May 26, 2022","3.0"
13,"It was okay. ","Okay place to work at. Seems like all they cared about was sales. It paid the bills. Work life balance was okay. Not a job I was completely thrilled about. ","Service Representative","Former Employee","Gloucester City, NJ","May 26, 2022","3.0"
14,"Don't work here","I have been with the company for 6 months and been without a manager for 5 months. I have to learn the banks systems by myself with no help from upper management. Don't waste your time with this company. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Asheville, NC","May 26, 2022","1.0"
15,"Micromanage and demeaning ","Worked here for 3 months as a Sales Rep because that's all I could take. Managers micromanage you. You can't even go to the bathroom. If you do, they'll ask where you were for so long (3-10 mins). I remember during training, someone asked are we allowed to take a break to go to the bathroom. One supervisor said do it on your scheduled break time. Taking calls back to back with people screaming at you and they don't let you take a break to decompress from it. This place is horrible for your mental, physical and emotional health","Sales Associate","Former Employee","Remote","May 25, 2022","1.0"
16,"Good job. ","Good place to work. Great benefits. Flexible schedules. Great managers. Could offer more opportunities to advance within lines of business. But overall a good place to work. ","Processor","Former Employee","Miamisburg, OH","May 25, 2022","5.0"
17,"They 'customer service' their own employees","The pay is nice however the stress is almost not worth it. Half the time you don't even know who your manager is. They are getting so big that they can't properly service their employees and you just get pushed around. I've heard that they will escalate issues too many times and nothing is ever done. ","Customer Care Center Rep","Current Employee","Frankenmuth, MI","May 23, 2022","1.0"
18,"You are just an underpaid Robot","They expect the world, with repetitive, duplicate documentation using sub standard computer systems that are always crashing. No work/life balance unless you are Management. They feel that they can command your life 24/7. Schedules set, but that is all fake since once you plan on the schedule set for you, they change it at a moment's notice despite anything you may have planned. If you refuse to 'fill in', they lump you as a non-team player. Management commits you to work areas and times they have not asked you ahead of time. Lunches are always interrupted, so if you want to have the time you are allowed, you have to actually leave the premises and turn off your phone.","Service Associate","Former Employee","Maryland","May 23, 2022","1.0"
19,"Company seems great, but my branch wasn't. ","I had high hopes with this bank. Poor management within my branch contributed to a terrible work environment. Too much gossip about new people. Managers lie because they don't know the answer. ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","North Carolina","May 22, 2022","2.0"
20,"Stressful place to work . Over worked and undervalued ","You are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated at all. Management is terribly and there is always miscommunication between managers. Such a stressful job. ","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Doylestown, PA","May 22, 2022","2.0"
21,"Pay is good ","It a ok company to work for but they are not organized I wish it stayed bank B because once it become this bank they changed a lot but the pay is better I will say that's the only thing that's better than bank B ","Branch Banker","Former Employee","Birmingham, AL","May 22, 2022","3.0"
22,"No Comment ","Typical Banking profit over people mentality. Better you do the more overwhelmed other areas are and then leads to great worker morale. On top of that the better one does the more incentive one makes but less they have to dole out for next quarterly making it harder to make said goals.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 21, 2022","2.0"
23,"The bank of the past"," this bank tries so hard to be a bank of the future but has terrible systems in place filled with service issues. Multiple locations have gone cashless yet atm always have service issues, new system still has a lot of bugs to work out and staffing is always a problem due to a high turnover rate. They expect you to drive sales but do not properly train you or give you proper product knowledge. The variety in products/ services is not competitive enough with the market and customer service department is even long wait times for the internal lines. The check in process for clients is completely awful and most customers complain about it yet it is enforced tremendously.Management gets to do whatever they want and regional manager doesn't really care about what's actually going on in the branches. This is a great place to work if you like to be swamped with clients and have a bunch of meaningless tasks to complete you barely have time to do.","Universal Banker","Former Employee","Virginia Beach, VA","May 19, 2022","2.0"
24,"Got me through Covid, But still not satisfactory ","I'm grateful to this bank for getting me and my family through covid, and the benefits ( HSA, PARENTAL LEAVE, VACATION ) are nice, but ultimately due to some poor changes in incentives, branch hours, staffing and pay, i wouldn't call this bank a great company to work for. ","Branch Banker and Sales Associate","Current Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 18, 2022","2.0"
25,"Good Start to banking career, burned out quickly ","Great place to learn and start your bank career. Lots of support from team members if you needed it. Downside was politics and playing favorites which I feel is most bank culture at the branch level. Really depends on management and there willingness to mentor you ","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Georgia","May 18, 2022","3.0"
26,"Branch Manager ","1) Overworked, expected to work 6 days a week, work life balance is a joke in retail banking. 2) Sales quota doesn't reflect branch location and traffic. this bank approval criteria for lending services is extremely rigid, that doesn't work in a low to meditate income area. In addition managers have to drive small business in addition to other duties. 3) operations is outdated! Complete waste of productivity.

27,"Productive, great learning experience, enjoyable job","I really enjoyed my time with this bank Financial Institution. I had an outstanding manager that I learned a lot from! A great place to work, with great compensation and benefits!","Bank Teller Supervisor","Former Employee","Willard, OH","May 17, 2022","5.0"
28,"Poor management ","Regional manger hires his friends from previous competitors and makes them managers. They are lazy, incompetent and arrogant. Turnover is high, training is horrible","Lead Teller","Current Employee","Philadelphia County, PA","May 17, 2022","2.0"
29,"Overall a good company","This company has plenty of opportunities for advancement. It's just getting past the managers that have a chip on their shoulders. The micromanaging and the attitudes were overwhelming. ","Business Banking Specialty","Former Employee","Remote","May 16, 2022","4.0"
30,"Great company, poor senior managers"," this bank (mortgage) is an all right company to work for. I love that they promote working remotely, and so far all of my direct managers have been great! However, my senior managers have not been. They only care about reports and numbers, and not the actual employee. If you're blessed to work here & have a great frontline a manger then you'll be fine. Oh yea, getting hired on is like you're working for the FBI. The hiring process is strenuous and doesn't even align with the job and environment of the company.","Loan Processor","Current Employee","Remo","May 16, 2022","3.0"
31,"The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the change in policy and procedures it can get to be a little tricky","The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the change in policy and procedures it can get to be a little tricky. When there is an issue with the employee especially one that has given years of service to this bank they should have More of a voice than what they have when it come to Disciplinary action","Senior Teller","Former Employee","Montezuma, GA","May 16, 2022","1.0"
32,"Good place to work ","If you can self manage while working from home, you can be very successful. However, if you can't, then you will fail rather quickly. Management is great, except for one person, however minimal interaction with them makes this job very satisfying.","Manager","Current Employee","Remote","May 14, 2022","4.0"
33,"Great way to start but limited room for growth","I found my time within the Investor Reporting Department to be full of learning opportunities and really appreciated my coworkers and management in their enthusiastic willingness to teach me as I worked. I would highly recommend you start your career with this bank. ","Loan Processing Analyst","Former Employee","Remote","May 13, 2022","5.0"
34,"Great place to work if you are hard working","I have been at this bank for only 2 months but I can confidently tell you it's a great place to work. They actively look to promote from within, as well as they are incredibly supportive. It is FAST PACED LEARNING so be prepared for that. If you get overwhelmed, tell your mentors, they are incredible and want you to succeed. I happen to work very late hours and I didn't feel that was significantly expressed to me when I accepted the job, but the pay and benefits outweigh the unfortunate working hours. ","Lending Specialist","Current Employee","Remote","May 13, 2022","5.0"
35,"Really cool","I liked working here it was fun and got good experience and got paid well enough for the hours and got some really great experience and it was fun lol","Investment Banking Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","May 12, 2022","5.0"
36,"Micromanaging, no work life balance","Branch manager role. Micromanagement to the core. Report after report of things you aren't doing correctly. Audits are conducted through the cameras. Absolutely no cell phone tolerance. Branch managers are business bankers- cold calls to prospect businesses and held accountable for achieving business goals alone (no bankers open business accounts) and held accountable for achieving consumer side as well. Incentive pay out only happens when 50% of your bankers achieve their goals, not if the branch is 100% or above or if you achieve the business goal that you are held personally accountable for. under-staffed and no applicants. Expected to conduct weekly meetings with every employee to touch base their goals - with no staff. Depending on branch size, bankers expected to call 800+ calls to consumers and branch managers expected to conduct consumer and business calls to be at target. this bank is in the middle of switching programs to make it 'easier' - it's not. Expected to have 5 star customer service, write monthly action plans, and call surveys conducted on the branch for feedback and now additional calls to bad surveys to be invited back to be surveyed again. Phones must be answered on 3rd ring, even in front of clients at your station, expected to deliver offers to the client in the same interaction while delivering exceptional customer service, within a 'timely' (2 minute) manner. Corporate drives through your branches drive thru's and times their wait time while surprise visiting your branch. Anyway, good benefits.

37,"Great coworkers, fair pay","As long as you have a good manager, this is a great place to work. Everyone is super helpful and fun to work with. We do have goals to meet each month which gives me a challenge but I enjoy that. ","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Millersburg, OH","May 11, 2022","4.0"
38,"Great company but horrible upper management","great company to work for but everyone is competing against each other....sometimes management told you one thing and then damned if you do and don't. its a country club place... mickey mouse house club.","Relationship Banker","Former Employee","New Jersey","May 10, 2022","3.0"
39,"Great Work Culture ","I love work at this bank they hold strong core value and actually follow them. They are big on employee development and a innovative company. They take customer and employee feedback and in corporate it into there procedure. The pay is great as well. I love this bank ","Customer Service Representative","Current Employee","Remote","May 10, 2022","5.0"
40,"Terrible","Horrible place to work. Awful management and even more awful culture. Truly a miserable experience. Just enough pay to make other places less appealing not enough pay to make for a decent life. All around demoralizing and inhumane work environment. ","Consumer Loans Recovery Specialist","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","May 9, 2022","1.0"
41,"Poor Retail Lending leadership has led to a mass exodus of top talent. No signs of improvement. ","Since the current leadership in the Retail Lending business has taken over the business environment has suffered greatly. The majority of the experienced product management talent have all left over the last year as a result of poor leadership and recent leadership decisions have made thing worse, especially in the card business. If you're considering a role in retail/card proceed with caution. Average pay, a difficult management team and low morale make this a challenging place to work. ","Senior Product Manager","Current Employee","Cleveland, OH","May 9, 2022","2.0"
42,"Do not take FA job at the branch","Bankers and tellers are forced to provide you with so call referrals. 99% are bad, so they can get management off their backs. The book you are given has been picked by all the old time advisors and you are left with the lower level clients. Compensation is also poor if you can not meet your goals. ","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Eatontown, NJ","May 9, 2022","1.0"
43,"Management is super toxic.No confidentiality, hard to get vacation requested. ","Sales pressure. Goals are unrealistic.Pressured to sale credit cards is insane.Constantly driving to Milwaukee for meetings that could be done virtually.Can't sit down. You get to work 8 + hours on your feet. ","Service Associate","Former Employee","West Bend, WI","May 8, 2022","2.0"
44,"Not a good place to work. Goals are way to high and pay is very low compared to other banks. "," Not a good place to work. Goals are way to high and pay is very low compared to other banks. However the benefits are somewhat good. But management looks everything that you do and criticizes your work. I would not consider this place if you are thinking about going into the banking industry.","Personal Banker","Former Employee","Vienna, VA","May 7, 2022","1.0"
45,"Lots of contact with home office in PA and everyone was super to work with!","Loved working here and would still be there if they had not moved their offices back to Pittsburgh. Now they have come back to Texas!!! Management was terrific. What we was needed to do the job was provided.","Staff Assistant to Branch Manager","Former Employee","Dallas, TX","May 6, 2022","5.0"
46,"Good company","If you do your part they will definitely take care of you. They do offer a lot of advancement if you put enough effort into you job. Was very happy while employed with them ","Assistant Branch Manager","Former Employee","Lancaster, OH","May 4, 2022","3.0"
47,"Great Company because of Trainers & Management","The Trainers, and the training scheduled classes were really informative and live real day to day experiences.The only thing is when you were asked to get work done(overtime) and were not paid for it.","Mortgage Loan Processor Remote","Former Employee","Jacksonville, FL","May 4, 2022","4.0"
48,"Used to be decent, now a total nightmare ","Managers do not care about you, they treat you as a number. Compensation for goals were taken away yet you are still demanded to meet those goals. Corporate is a joke, they could care less about the little people. Expect to leave late and work every weekend since they barely hire people. Good job if you want to put a paycheck before your mental and physical health.","Bank Teller","Current Employee","Troy, MI","May 3, 2022","1.0"
49,"Retail Lending business environment continues to suffer under current leadership team (Especially in Card) ","Over the past 3-4 years the work environment in this bank's retail lending world has suffered greatly due to it's ineffective leadership team. As a result the work environment has become toxic, especially in card for both the product team and business partners. Lack of leadership experience, poor strategic vision and the careless approach to managing employee relations and growth has lead to a mass exodus of much of the top talent. As a result of an weak and inexperienced leadership team it is nearly impossible to accomplish the goals that are set and it has begun to negatively impact business in a major way. Under current leadership, especially in card, not a great environment to work in. ","Product Manager","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","May 3, 2022","2.0"
