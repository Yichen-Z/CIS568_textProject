"Stressful","Banking as a whole has become an awful industry to work in. Large corporations still using old school tactics to bring in sales.

"Every year they cut your pay","Every year they expect you to work 20% harder for 20% less. There is no future of growth for you as an MLO. Management makes poor decisions, but you as the employee shoulder the burden for it. They don't hire the staff when the market is hot, and they then overcompensate by hiring too much, and don't see the market changing. Currently, their idea of fixing the market downturn is for you to call dead end phone numbers of existing customers in their data base. Then the Master Plan is to automate MLOs out of their jobs as much as possible to assure future cuts in MLO pay.","Sr Mortgage Loan Originator","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","May 29, 2022","2.0"

"Worst place to work","No work life balance. Outdated systems. Extreme Micromanaging. They watch you by cameras and then open investigations based on assumptions. You don't have control over your branch and no ability to waive fees for good clients! If you need to step out of the branch and have worked over 40 hours they still make you use your occasional absence! The Regional Manager could not even understand that goes against Florida Law! this bank wants you to just be a micromanaging robot! Clients are just another person and they say they are about relationship building but their actions do not show it!

"It'll do, but it kind of sucks","When I started at this bank I was really excited and energized. I had heard a lot about the opportunities this bank offers. That part is true, they have a lot of different departments you can train in and growth opportunities. The downside is you do have to stay an entire year in your current position before you can apply for a different one. So if you hate the area you're working in you better be able to suck it up for 12 months. They do their best to have life/work balance and are big on employees quality of life. However, if you work in a physical branch, you will not be trained. I moved from the care center to the branch and was put in an office for 4 months to train myself. I made countless mistakes every single day due to lack of resources and training. They use outdated software that is extremely hard to navigate and crashes constantly. I got fired for something small, it was my fault, but a writeup may have been a good first step as I had never had a red mark. The people I worked with were great but you could tell how much they hated their jobs. The end of my career with this bank I was extremely burned out and stressed. If you want to be overworked and work 6 days a week twice a month, this bank would be for you. ","Banker","Former Employee","Paw Paw, MI","May 26, 2022","2.0"
"Productive, inclusive but lacks work life balance","Everyone does their share here although some managers believe in micromanaging. You only have to stay in each position for a year and you can move around and apply for a new position as much as you would like. My only 2 complaints are with the pay; while they increased the base pay for all positions, positions like tellers supervisors and people who are both bankers and tellers have sales requirements but receive no sales pay. Also the hours are getting worse it makes work life balance hard for those who have small children. Maternity, 401k, stock options, and tuition reimbursement along with other benefits are great.","Lead Teller","Current Employee","Delaware","May 26, 2022","3.0"

Schedules set, but that is all fake since once you plan on the schedule set for you, they change it at a moment's notice despite anything you may have planned. If you refuse to 'fill in', they lump you as a non-team player. Management commits you to work areas and times they have not asked you ahead of time.

Multiple locations have gone cashless yet atm always have service issues, new system still has a lot of bugs to work out and staffing is always a problem due to a high turnover rate. They expect you to drive sales but do not properly train you or give you proper product knowledge. The variety in products/ services is not competitive enough with the market and customer service department is even long wait times for the internal lines. The check in process for clients is completely awful and most customers complain about it yet it is enforced tremendously.Management gets to do whatever they want and regional manager doesn't really care about what's actually going on in the branches.

"Micromanaging, no work life balance","Branch manager role. Micromanagement to the core. Report after report of things you aren't doing correctly. Audits are conducted through the cameras. Absolutely no cell phone tolerance. Branch managers are business bankers- cold calls to prospect businesses and held accountable for achieving business goals alone (no bankers open business accounts) and held accountable for achieving consumer side as well. Incentive pay out only happens when 50% of your bankers achieve their goals, not if the branch is 100% or above or if you achieve the business goal that you are held personally accountable for. under-staffed and no applicants. Expected to conduct weekly meetings with every employee to touch base their goals - with no staff. Depending on branch size, bankers expected to call 800+ calls to consumers and branch managers expected to conduct consumer and business calls to be at target. this bank is in the middle of switching programs to make it 'easier' - it's not. Expected to have 5 star customer service, write monthly action plans, and call surveys conducted on the branch for feedback and now additional calls to bad surveys to be invited back to be surveyed again. Phones must be answered on 3rd ring, even in front of clients at your station, expected to deliver offers to the client in the same interaction while delivering exceptional customer service, within a 'timely' (2 minute) manner.

Worst part is daily reports about how you take too long by so-many-seconds on average, per call. You just have to enjoy helping people and realize you're doing just fine.

"I used to love this job, but things have gotten tough.","I started at this bank a few years ago and moved up pretty quickly after snagging a few promotions. I used to love this job, but find it getting harder everyday to get up and do my best. I feel like since the merger in 2021, we've been on a very difficult path to recovery and not much is being done to help the front line staff answering customer questions and complaints. We went from being busy (1-2 minute call wait times) to exceptionally busy (customers are waiting 30 minutes to an hour before an agent is able to help). Since the turn of the year, this has not been getting better. this bank has tried to help some of these people by raising the minimum wage company-wide. While that did help some newer people, a lot of us got stuck with little to nothing in terms of a rate increase. While it MAY get back to normal in the next few months it has been pretty terrible from October 2021 to the current date.

"The this bank Board needs to reexamine the Leadership!"," this bank has turned management into a team of babysitters that only recognize what the team is doing wrong. Never a 'good job' or 'great progress' and more importantly 'THANK YOU'. Leaders address those who are not performing individually. I am sick of hearing how the team failed when I meet all of my goals! The majority of people are working long hours, training is practically non-existent or sporadic at best, we are told to reduce errors and take our time and the next day to pick up extra work and get it done faster (while constantly training due to turnover because we have no formal department training program). Can't you manage the company while retaining and keeping your employees semi-happy at their workplace? Also, it is sickening to read what the Executives receive in yearly stock options/bonuses, your yearly salary is already more than my whole department combined! I understand the dynamics and responsibilities on your shoulders but you have turned extremely greedy while watching the staff figure out how they are going to feed their family/or pay for parking on their meager salary. I will obtain my degree in 2 months, I doubt my manager even remembers, and like some others, I am looking for a job that appreciates and rewards me for my work ethic and loyalty as well as my desire to assist others while independently striving to grow myself.

Each year I have seen more than 40% of teams turning over and spent a significant amount of work time recruiting for open roles. However once we get people hired, often we don't have work for them to do or they end up with busy work that isn't challenging. this bank isn't a culture where business results are prioritized enough, doing work tasks and having meetings is and the result is that they're falling behind in offering modern customer experiences. I am really disappointed in my experience, I expected to learn and grow and what I found is that management doesn't take the talent they have seriously.","Senior Strategy Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","March 12, 2022","2.0"
"Fast paced but monotonous ","My role as a teller is fast paced, the branch is very busy. Management feels out of touch with teller needs. The schedule changes daily and you're frequently stuck working beyond your scheduled shift time but even when you give advanced notice that you need a day off management makes you feel like it's a big deal and doesn't seem to want to work with you. Customers are super mean to new employees who are trying to follow policy for protecting customer accounts. The pay is higher than anywhere else in the area, and they do offer benefits, vacation time, sick time, etc. I would say this bank is a good company, there's plenty opportunities for growth, but I don't believe in my current branch that I have the tools I need to be successful and I don't want to stay long term.

"Conversion Nightmare","As a former bank B employee of 10+ years, I was very happy. When this bank bought out bank B I was hesitant but excited for something new. This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed. The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform their jobs efficiently. I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off. The job roles we were placed into did not align with prior roles and responsibilities. The stress level is unreal. Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress. Imagine starting a new job as a banker. You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and procedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat. Not one person knows these new systems and it's time to open the doors on a Monday. You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to. That want to service accounts but you don't know how. That truly need you to help them but you can't. That is what this process is like. My advice, stay away until they figure out. 5 months in and there are still so many issues to resolve. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Georgetown, TX","March 8, 2022","1.0"

"Terrible Onboarding/Training experience ","Minimal training provided in a group virtual setting. The people in my group were hired for business banking and they definitely didn't seem qualified. Most didn't pay attention and were super disrespectful to the trainer. They couldn't grasp most of it and only 2 weeks of training they put you on the phone all but yourself before you even know how to use the systems and tell you to figure it out. Their 'in the moment support' requires you to wait long periods of time for someone to get to you which leaves the customer on hold forever and creates a terrible customer and agent experience. In the moment they have no time to explain what they tell you to do and you can't stop taking calls to ask. The calls are back to back with no break to document or look around. As soon as the client hangs another is in your ear. Craziest experience I've ever had. I've always been a top agent working virtually in customer service and NEVER seen anything like this.

Great, but when my performance review came, I was denied an increase since I had already reached the 75% percentile, and regardless of my job performance I was already earning the maximum allowed. Their salary was not competitive at all.They also ended up closing a lot of offices in the area within a few years of the acquisition.

"Trained for one job but ended up doing a different job","This company literally set me up for failure. I was supposed be crossed trained on multiple jobs but was only allowed to be a teller, so I never was allowed to put the training in to use, therefore the rare times I was allowed to do my actual job, I had no hands on experience. The company puts great emphasis on selling products to get commissions, which caused an environment that was overly competitive and coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission would not let me train because they did not want me to get the commission and/or credit for the 'sale'. The environment was hostile, especially at certain offices. (I was a floater) I was there for 2 years and was very unhappy for the most part. The teller training was great, but there was a lot of overnight travel, usually for a week at a time, but the hotels were nice so if you like that kind of traveling it's nice.

Managers micromanage you and don't give you clear answers on how to improve, they just throw articles in your face so if you are hands on it takes multiple mistakes to learn anything. They have unrealistic goals they want you to meet and they don't care about you as a individual, they only care about numbers. You will be monitored on every single thing you are doing.
