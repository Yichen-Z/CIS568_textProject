Customers get so mad they have to wait, but then need to take up all of your time as well. Employees I worked with felt entitled to not having to do certain tasks, even when they worked for me. Management expects you to work as mandatory like they do but there is a large gap in pay that comes along with why management has to work as much as they do. Nothing about the company screams work for us and not our competitors.","TELLER SUPERVISOR","Former Employee","Maryland","September 26, 2019","3.0"

If I had been aware of the pay I would have never applied to take the position. I literally go home and have nightmares over my workplace environment- not reaching my goals, work being left out, upper management. this bank has affected my personal mental health more than I care to admit, as I know it has done to others, the evidence is all in the incredibly high turnover rate. With all that being said, I love the environment of my branch. My manager is amazing. I would stay forever if it wasn't for the fact it was this bank.

"Good Remote Job and Traditional Blend","This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met. Lots of autonomy with getting job done! Products and services of bank are very strong too as this bank leads in several spaces. The people are nice to work with within the retail and commercial branch network but the company is disjointed from its legacy culture in Pittsburgh. The company has restructured incentives to significantly decrease incentive pay. Incentive pay for this role is also dependent on far away teammate performance and not pay for individual performance which can leave the BDO doing double duty to make up for teammate performance if they want a pay-out. There's no remedy for this. There's no real career trajectory outside of retail side of bank. Management skill level for this line of business is below average often resorting to pitting teammates against one another, openly disparaging partner lines of business & individual people. There's a severe lack of emotional IQ, and extreme passive aggressiveness that thwarts productivity and lowers team morale.","OUT OF BRANCH BANKING","Former Employee","Atlanta, GA","September 17, 2019","3.0"

They still get paid for it, they'll also make the schedule with them 'working' 41-45 hours, but in reality they work maybe 35. Everyone talks trash about each other, especially upper management, even outside of the bank.

Turnover and burnout accepted as the norm by upper management. Consistently under-staffed and short resources. There is a reason big banks have the reputation they do. This place takes the cake for hypocrisy because public facing marketing tells one story but once you get in, it's the complete opposite. 100% turnover is commonplace. Don't believe me? Walk into any branch in the Atlanta Metro Region and survey how long people have worked there outside of management. Ask what turn over is like in general and if it's common to have turnover. Ask if the branch is fully staffed and how long it has been that way. There were branches that could not even open the doors on a consistent basis without redirecting employees from their regular home branch to cover others because of being short staffed.

"Initial training was good and exciting but branch ruined it","I believe a company should be graded on how they treat customers and employees. I worked at this location and I was forced to watch the door half my day everyday and was told that my numbers would double everyday and they WANTED me to feel stressed out and overloaded so I would produce better numbers. I was as a new employee only 4 weeks in this branch told off and humiliated in front of a customer because I didn't know how to do it ( I was told I got it when I didn't. when I tried to object I was than told u got it like it's easy A second time. During this process I tried to ask my branch manager for help (you know so I can do it right) but she was chatting with a friend instead of offering assistance. Turns out I didn't Open an account correctly and literally got told off infront of the customer and humiliated.) I had enough of the lack of training and that awful experience made me contact HR but With me being within the 90 day period I felt I didn't matter because it took over a week for a response. I ended up calling her out and the branch manager came in and tried to blame it on me not trying to listen to there 'teachings'. They would threaten me about 90 days coming up and me having to take it seriously. Keep in mind I literally had to stand in the lobby half of my day. I was setup for failure and humilated and harassed ( they would tell me I can't touch my beard and talk about how I would sit when making calls). I was fired for refusing to take there training and produce numbers. I was told it's like a retail store if u don't like it you give it back.

"A review I wish I would have read prior","I was hired at a PT customer core consultant. The first 7 weeks of training are very redundant and long. A lot of self paced modules and 'role playing'. One of the systems used does not have a training bank, so when you're placed one your first call day in training its a bit confusing because it's only been explained to you, not hands on. We have 2 trainers, one whom was great the other, not so great. The time off is a complete nightmare for anyone who has kids. You have to be there a year before you receive any PTO and if you have to take time off before then you receive an 'occurrence'. Being a previous manager at bank, I do understand the need and responsibility of being at work and being on time, but I also understand that life happens. If you get to many of these occurrences you'll be terminated. After your 7 weeks of training you go into transition for 5 weeks for is a full 6 hours on the phones with ONE 15 minute break. I was told I needed a note from my doctor if I had to get up and use the bathroom an 'excessive' amount of times. If I hadn't of had previous banking experience, this job would have been difficult for me to learn as they do not explain the in's and out's of banking very well. You have a Team Lead during your 12 weeks, then after you are sent to your destination, you will have another Team Lead. The pay is OK. I think considering the effort, customer abuse and minimal breaks, the pay should be increased. At time I feel like a work horse.

Compensation is good, particularly for a job that doesn't require a degree, but my supervisor always said she wouldn't be retiring anytime soon on her paychecks. The only real problem was upper management. They breathed down my managers' necks so much that they were always stressed, which then caused everyone else to be stressed.

"Be careful what you wish for","I was recruited away from another company after over 6 years there, was promised the things that my former company could not provide for my career to grow. From the first month there I realized this bank was not very different from my previous company in regards to management. They have managers that go by advice from senior employees, some of them should not be in any position to give management advice. I was told I was ready to go to my new location, then 3 days later told I was not. Then I found out from other employees that the person who was training me was not happy I was to be replacing them. They lied and falsified information, including sending fake emails about my position! This kept me from fulfilling the position I was hired for. I found out after I left the next person to replace my position also was treated unfairly and quit due to this same situation, by the same employee! I would definitely make sure you have asked and gotten every question answered before accepting a position there. Although I left my previous company in good standing I could not go back, as my position had been filled. I ended up not only losing my seniority, but my 401k match, my PTO of 6 weeks, all my benefits, including stock purchase options. My advice to management is make sure you have honest employees, with integrity giving your branch managers advice, especially if they do not like the new employee(s).

There is no work life balance because you're expected to work until the daily work is finished even if it takes 10 hours that day but management leaves at 2pm.

"An okay place to work","Days would sometimes be long, and management seemed to make you want to do way more than a loan officer would need to. I feel that we would end up processing a lot of the process, and many times having to calculate things ourselves instead of getting help from underwriting.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Downers Grove, IL","August 6, 2019","3.0"
"Inviting community and coworkers"," this bank is an excellent bank to learn about the financial industry for someone with no experience. Excellent customer service for clients, great work-life balance, incentives, etc. Sales goals can sometimes be unrealistic. Regional Manager focuses on weaknesses and missed opportunities without congratulating strengths and accomplishments. I used to love my branch and the clients and I wanted to advance with them, but they make it impossible to get a promotion. If you are willing to put years of service into one branch, this is the job for you! If you are looking to grow with an organization, then it's possible but only if your are willing to relocate with every step.","Branch Sales and Services Associate","Current Employee","Chapel Hill, NC","August 5, 2019","4.0"
"No work/life balance and management is cliquey","If you enjoy no work/life balance and 'management' that rewards brown nosing, apply. They are hands down the WORST company I've ever had the displeasure working at. I cannot think of one positive thing to say. Training is horrible, and they penalize you for going past break and lunch to help the customer.","Loan Servicing Specialist","Former Employee","Cincinnati, OH","August 5, 2019","1.0"
"Great place to start your career","There is potential for a wonderful career for the right person. You must enjoy a highly regulated industry with strict policies and procedures.

"Diverse workplace with many different projects","Usually the day will begin with a daily standup meeting to set goals for the day and review what has been done. Then the day will begin in earnest with a mix of development work and possibly more meetings to discuss requirements and work through outside obstacles. The hardest part of the job is that there are multiple layers of permissions to acquire so the start of the job is very slow.","Java Web Developer","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","August 4, 2019","3.0"
"Horrible Management","When you're hired for a job you EXPECT to do that job right?? Well that's not how this bank looks at things. I understand that you have to help out with certain things but when you don't get the proper training and then you're thrown out to the wolves is terrible.

"Good first job with no degree requirement","It's a sales job. You have goals and you're pressured to meet them. Hours are flexible but I always drew the short end of the stick. Working every holiday and most weekends. I'd get maybe 1 off a month. I've gone through 3 managers, going on 4 in less than a year. 2 of the managers were terrible. Absolutely terrible.","Financial Consultant","Current Employee","Maryland","August 2, 2019","2.0"

"Depends completely on management.","How the job functioned depended on communication and management. Very poor management at this location. Head teller would tell you one thing and branch manager would say another. Manager would assume you knew things and not tell you about changes, like alter your work schedule the day before. It gets very busy and there is no one to help you a lot of the time. Very stressful, there were never enough employees, because they would quit over the stress.","Teller","Former Employee","Lumberton, NJ","August 2, 2019","2.0"

When I took a dif position I was targeted to get fired. My cases were being audited when no one else on the team was. All of my mis steps were brought to light, until they found something that could get me fired.

"Encouraging management that was open to new ideas from employees","Atypical day off tax season was working to improve the departments functions, procedures and process to create a more efficient environment and to mitigate risk and provide consistency throughout the department. During tax season it was 6-7 days a week making sure all of the processes where working properly to ensure we could meet all tax deadlines.The culture on my team was one of openness and sharing of ideas to create better processes. The hardest part was making sure the department could meet the strict tax deadlines both internally and the ones placed by the taxing authorities.

"Horrible experience","Training was the best part. No flexibility with student schedules even though I was reassured by multiple people that wouldn't be an issue during the interview and training period. I had to call in sick once due to strep throat and an ear infection, I had a doctors note. I missed two other days of work due to an out of town funeral and had no access to a phone so I emailed my boss. 4 days later on my next shift I received an email from him stating that I had refused to adhere to company policy. Was fired as soon as I came in and told that the days missed for the funeral would be converted to paid sick leave. After he has been refusing to return my calls after $20 had been deposited into my account I was told by the call center there was nothing anyone could do as he had went against company policy. Livid is an understatement.","Teller","Former Employee","Portage, MI","July 22, 2019","2.0"
"Coworkers were friendly and productive, but I found management's support to be fleeting.","At the onset of my tenure, my manager and senior management above seemed very supportive, forthcoming, and positive. I did not have any previous experience in a banking environment, but everyone seemed much friendlier and more accommodating than I expected. However, I found support to be tenuous when it mattered. Although training was very good, there was not sufficient warnings against job-ending errors and infractions (mine included). In my short time, I've seen experienced tellers, bankers, and advisors forced into retirement and terminated with very thin cause to do so. It can be a nice place to work, but beware.","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Ohio","July 22, 2019","3.0"

"Management is terrible!","This place is a joke!! There in NO room for advancement!! The management is absolutely terrible, upper management does nothing to support the staff. HR & Ethics is a bunch of bologna. Don't take anything into consideration, automatically sides with the NEWLY employed manager from BOA whom always puts down her employees and talks about them to other employees... one bad customer service survey will put you in the red for the whole year and that is held against you for any raises or promotions! I should know! I had 18 shops! 17 perfect and ONE not!! Can't make them all happy!! But it was held against me and I was told that I needed to make an action plan to better my client experience! Save yourself the headache! My co-workers, including myself dread going to work everyday! It was never like this prior! We all enjoyed the place we worked! The keep hiring BOA manager who is trying to turn this place into BOA!","Banker","Current Employee","Lake Worth, FL","July 21, 2019","3.0"
"Great benefits, but my manager clearly didn't want me to advance","I have only worked here about 5 months but it's an incredibly easy job. I have been told by every coworker that i am the fastest teller to catch on. I talked to my manager about opportunities to advance and at first it was 6 months recommended but not required, then it was required 6 months, then it was 6 months to a year. I just don't like that although she says she succeeds when her staff succeeds she isn't actually doing anything to help that happen. She also tells me it's because I haven't mastered my position but tells me nothing that I can do to fix that. The teller lead is also very petty. She doesn't like doing her job and takes her sweet time greeting drive through, but gets snippy if we don't do it the second it happens. I think she's just insecure with her position because I honestly don't see how she is qualified for it. They promote people who don't follow the rules, but hold people back who have been told that they are the best teller there. It makes no sense. It's a great job if you don't get bored easily and you don't mind not advancing quickly. The benefits are great though and I'm very happy with the multiple health care options and the paid time off.","TELLER","Current Employee","PA","July 21, 2019","4.0"
