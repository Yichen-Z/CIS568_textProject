3164,"Care Sales Environment","Production and goals are what drive growth I understand, but the push and focus on numbers and sales at this bank are by far the worse I have ever experienced in my 9+ years of working. I have been in banking for 6 of those 9 and this company is horrible with the pressure. Every single day is littered with emails and conference calls about NUMBER NUMBERS NUMBERS. Your inbox will be cleared the day before and the next day you come in you see 100+ emails with every single branch flaunting about one account here one credit card there. We are literally coming in everyday to scam people into banking products PERIOD. We are forced to act as used car salesmen on a daily basis.

I worked with a base salary plus commission","Financial Advisor","Former Employee","Englewood, OH","October 20, 2017","3.0"
3167,"Terrible Pay for Tellers","This bank should be ashamed of what they pay their Tellers. Tellers work with money and that is the most important thing in the bank besides the customers.

That's awful!","Cashier","Former Employee","Kansas","October 20, 2017","1.0"

3174,"The hardest part of the job","The hardest part of this role is the on-the-job training experience for handling the sales and service sides of a branch store.

3178,"this bank is the most underhanded company to work for","Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for it. this bank does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset that over time. this bank lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits them. Management is an absolute joke. If you ever try to leave the company, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, those managers will try everything in their power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if they can help it. I know from personal experience. Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet those goals, this bank won't fire you for not meeting the goals, but they WILL fire you for not doing your 'job'. The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if this bank is not careful, they will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has. I would never recommend this company to ANYONE.","Branch Sales and Service Associate","Current Employee","Tuscaloosa, AL","October 17, 2017","1.0"

3182,"Great place to work","I really like my job I came with no banking experience but the training is very helpful I was able to earn a promotion in less than 6 months off being hired.

3185,"Rocky start, terribble management","The training process was lengthy and frustrating. You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved them in a timely manner. Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees. There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts. She would come and go for hours as she pleased. We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff. There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue. I personally felt demeaned and pushed aside by the branch manager.","Teller","Former Employee","Akron, OH","October 13, 2017","2.0"
3186,"Good full time job while in college","While in college, this was an ideal job. The flexible scheduling mixed with the busy workplace was productive. However, despite popular belief, this job is predominantly sales. Goals are set high and are difficult to meet unless you really know how to talk. You have to be willing to learn, as the coaching is there.
