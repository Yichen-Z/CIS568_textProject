3326,"Not a good place for loan officers","Worked in the Home Lending Center and it ended up being a nightmare. Volume was down significantly, resulting in the majority of LOs not hitting tier targets, thus leading to not making any money. There is likely going to be any change to the compensation plan to accurately reflect how much each loan officer is funding. It is hard to make a decent living off a low salary and very low commission. The leads are now stale, with internal customers being called up several times every other month. Processors on the backend are very inexperienced for the most part, and a lot of underwriters will poorly review files and not know product guidelines for the loan they are underwriting. The loan officers are dependent on them to make any, and it's frustrating when they perform poorly as your pay is somewhat dependent on them. Turn over is extremely high, with a good majority of new hires not lasting one year. They will train you without experience, and being a large company have excellent benefits.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 6, 2017","1.0"
