4873,"Downtown Pittsburgh"," this bank is a huge operation. Our section with Global Investment Services managed mutual funds which specifically involved preparing Form 1120-RICs and footnote disclosures for their annual reports. this bank decided to open a global investment service section in Pittsburgh in 2008, but then decided to close the entire operation in 2009 They told us that these jobs which were mostly based on the East Coast (Philadelphia and Boston) were ideal for Pittsburgh, but they abruptly had a change of heart and let go our entire floor, roughly 100 workers Regulated investment companies was an short stop during my 25 years of work experience. It wasn't a bad position, but the daily commute to downtown Pittsburgh was typically a 3 hour time period each day, both ways. The parking and food was quite expensive and the traffic/construction/accidents/weather/special events did present some challenges along the way. My manager was among my all-time favorites and my co-workers were very smart and devoted to our responsibilities.","Senior Tax Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 2, 2015","2.0"

4879,"It was okay","ona regular day you would be answering phone calls concerning this bank account holders about overdraft refunds, balances, online banking or any other type of banking question. I've learned a lot about everyday banking and step to prevent an overdraft from occuring. The co workers are amazing and are the most help when it comes to questions, whereas I found it very difficult to find a manager to answer questions or take an escalated phone call. But it pays very well and the hours are decent, plus you have every holiday off. The only downside is you have to be okay with hear customers cry or yell on the phone while still denying their request but if you can get over that your perfect.","Call Center Representative","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 29, 2015","3.0"
4880,"High turnover, questionable practices","In 2014 this bank hired 700 new employees, within 12 months 600 of them were gone. Experienced many questionable practices, particularly with Quality scoring, which I saw as their was as knocking down the bonus one qualified for. Coaches are young and over the top arrogant, not in the least bit constructive, if anything, they drove down moral; management seemed to have their back all the way, no matter what. The supervisor I worked under was noticeably insecure and gravitated to the brown nosers, leadership skills were very almost no existent. Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) were welcomed because they gave a moment of relief from being on the phones, sadly the Quick Starts became as daunting as being on the phones because all they were about was applauding for the top performers followed up by a pressure to raise the bar. In order to drive you, you're scores would be posted for everyone to see where you stood in the pecking order. There were lot's of contests to help drive you and ongoing pot lucks. Be prepared to donate, donate, donate. And if you're not the type to run around to be 'In a click', then you were going to be seen as an outsider. Overall this bank struck me as a very paranoid and oppressive organization, top-down. I'm all for hard work, but not having the life sucked out of me.","Multi Channel Customer Service","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","September 29, 2015","2.0"

4899,"Too Big to Connect","At this bank it can be hard to connect the large mission of the organization with the front lines. this bank says a lot about finding, developing, and retaining good talent, but the bottom line is that they don't put their money and resources where their talk is. Lately, this bank has been all about cutting expenses and growing revenue. While I completely understand why this is important for any business, the extremes that this bank has taken have limited the ability of its employees and managers to connect and grow. Instead, they've cut employee benefits, salaries for internal candidates are not competitive, and stress on the individual contributor and local managers is through the roof. The first and second level managers care and want to help grow the individual employees, but they are limited by bureaucracy and red tape. this bank is the largest company I've worked for, so my comparative experience is limited. I have given this bank the benefit of doubt for so long, but I do feel they could do much better.","CRR Team Lead","Current Employee","Cherry Hill, NJ","September 22, 2015","3.0"
