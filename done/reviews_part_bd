1455,"The Bank as a whole need some changes","The company's technology and policies needs a upgrade. Most banks have gone paperless and have mobile keypads. Management didn't cared about the well being of Tellers or Bankers. Management primary focus were the store's profit proxy. I have worked so much overtime voluntarily. I believed my contribution was helping the company. Instead of a thank you I got disciplined for it. My former manager had a nasty attitude.

Since there was a lack of staff, you find yourself doing everyone job. My manager was let go and this bank had us with no manager for 6 months. IT'S NOT OKAY! This caused us to go through many inconveniences and even jeopardize our career in banking. I had to quit because the regional manager had everything controlled and didn't care about the well being of the employees. She only cared about her numbers.

1495,"Think twice before you go to this bank","Let me start by saying... I was not fired and I do not have an axe to grind with this bank. I spent a few years there and it was one of the most highly disorganized places to work with unrealistic goals. They will promise you the world but never deliver on their end of the bargain. When I was there the turnover was the worst I have ever seen. They could not keep anyone staffed. they moved new leadership down from Pittsburgh to change the direction of the bank. The senior leadership team could careless about the employees. They only care about hitting goals at ANY cost.The entire state of NC is ran by people who treat the employees like livestock. They use you and dispose of you when you no longer hit the unrealistic goals. They will write you up and fire you at the drop of a hat. this bank has almost no market share in NC but they will expect you to produce the same numbers as your counterparts in Pittsburgh. Makes little to no sense. Everyone that is in a sales role there is miserable and constantly looking for a way out. I am happily employed at a smaller community bank and could not be happier.

1498,"They basically treat you like children...","It was mostly my trainer/facilitator that turned me off after I accepted my new position. First off, I was expecting the typical call center environment, but I was not expecting the whole brainwash theatrics regarding how rewarding it is to work for $15.00 an hour (which is still considered poverty level) and how much this bank and its CEO want you to succeed and move up within their company. Of course, working for someone else will always keep them at the top, and you as a replaceble employee, so please spare me. Anyways, my facilitator talked about how micromanaging is what they do not do - that was a lie. She literally admitted to moving/zooming our cameras around during virtual training in order to see if we were on our phones and/or doing other things. One day, my system froze, and I could not click my camera back on when we returned from break, so I told her (via phone) that I was here but may have to restart my computer due to it being frozen. She responds passive aggressively by stating 'we returned from break a few minutes ago but thanks for telling me'. Ma'am, we returned from break at 9:48AM. It is now 9:50AM. I tried to get the computer to work for 2 minutes before saying anything; sorry if that was too long. They basically treat you like children by constantly threatening to report those two minute 'tardies' to the Line of Business. Who really cares? The only thing I am glad about is that I did not accept a full time offer. That way, I do not spend all day working a position I am unhappy with.
