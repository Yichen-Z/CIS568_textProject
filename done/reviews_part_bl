1885,"It was a great entry point for someone new to banking","Initial training was well done and thorough. You spent time training at job start then would weave work/training together as you start the first few months. The UBC position was just rolling out at the time, so there was a big push to get many employees (new/old) up to speed on being a teller/platform associate. Once on goal, you had to make a sales minimum to get paid your bonus. Some were fortunate to work in busier branches than others. They implemented a cold calling program about mid-way through my tenure to gain appointments with existing customers. In this type of setting, you were always trying to involve yourself with customers- so everybody was looking over their shoulder. Management was good and there was decent pressure to perform, not overwhelming. Many of the best employees would leave for better positions with other banks. That was told to me at an early stage, and it came true for me as well. I was grateful for the training and mentoring I received there. It definitely helped get my next job.","UNIVERSAL BRANCH CONSULTANT","Former Employee","Chapel Hill, NC","December 10, 2018","3.0"

1892,"N/a"," this bank is a great place to work for entry level positions. I have learned a great deal throughout my tenure there through coaching, development, and collaborative team efforts. Upper management however is out of touch and does not seem to care for their employees much more than a number. There's a great deal of micro management and conference calls. The most enjoyable piece of the bank is servicing the clients of the bank.","Business Banking Center Branch Manager","Current Employee","Charlotte, NC","December 6, 2018","3.0"
1893,"Revolving Door of Financial Knowledge","Their are so many different skills that one could obtain on both the teller side and the Sale and Service side of the banking world.

1894,"Poor management and poor pay","It's laughable that this bank tries to preach employee financial wellness but chooses to pay $35/k a year for a risk job and a degree. Raises only occur if you meet all expectations and my raise was $400 added to my salary for the YEAR. Not a livable wage. My management team had both good and bad. High turnover because of the poor management and poor communication. Management does not care about the people under them., are defensive and take things personally. One boss even specifically told us not to talk on our lunch break sitting at our desk because he was in a bad mood. Management is constantly in meetings and never available. The team was great and there are a lot of great people. People coming in from the outside have more opportunities than those within because they don't have a 'meets some' rating on their reviews. A lot of people get those meets some and can't get a raise or advance within because other departments won't interview with that on their file. Be ready for change. Our department was constantly going they departmental changes and process changes. Technology is a joke. You need multiple programs to do your job and nothing works cohesively or just will not work at all sometimes. this bank's IT is awful. Training was minimal, however, you have 'errors' that work against you and either screw you or those who are in Quality review. The benefits are okay. The best thing is the maternity leave. After one year, you can receive 12 weeks 100% paid and can also have a few weeks with parental leave which is 100% paid. This was just from my specific department.","Detection and Investigation analyst","Former Employee","Brecksville, OH","December 5, 2018","2.0"
1895,"Typical Day","Typical Day is inquiries by customers. You are a problem solver for many, and a familiar face for others.
