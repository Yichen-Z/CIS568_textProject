731,"Decent work/life balance but overall you are just a number","I worked for this bank for over eleven years and yet I can sum up my thoughts on the company with one example and just a few sentences. In the department where I worked, the employees were grouped into teams which usually consisted of a dozen or so people, a team lead, and a manager. Our group of eight consultants and a team lead received a new manager after our manager retired. At the time, all nine of us had each been with the company for no less than ten years (and some over twenty). Within less than two years of this new manager taking over every single consultant and the team lead left by either transferring to another department, quitting, or retiring early. No one in upper management even noticed. The work itself isn't difficult but it does require a certain amount of knowledge and the training is insufficient. Communication between departments is chaotic and confusing and while the pay isn't terrible, raises are non-existent. As far as advancement, it depends on what department in the bank that you start from. If you begin in certain areas, no matter what degree or what experience you have you will be judged as being 'less than' and forced to advance in baby steps, often making lateral moves. That being said, there are opportunities to work from home and overall the job is kind to working mothers and fathers/young families.","Loan Support Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","July 8, 2020","2.0"
732,"Overall good","Was a teller for a year and half. Overall good experience but pay could have been better. Enjoyed set schedule and holidays off. Good intro into banks.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Aberdeen, MD","July 7, 2020","4.0"
733,"Unless you're dead inside, find something else","I've put in five years at this place and have watched really good employees get fired for really bizarre reasons, such as following a directive from a superior. Customer abuse is rampant, which is why, unless you're adept at burying all emotions, this is not a good job.","Escalation Manager","Former Employee","Oshtemo, MI","July 6, 2020","2.0"
734,"Workplace culture","There was no diversity at the branch I was employed at. Basically, there was preferential treatment towards a certain race. this bank as a corporation must first start educating within the branches before they donate anything to help the racism in America. My branch was racist and it was brought to upper management's attention.","Supervisor","Former Employee","Northwest Indiana","July 4, 2020","1.0"
735,"Would never recommend this employer","This bank does not care about their employees or are loyal to their employees. They hire people in at higher rates than the employees that currently worked there. ","Teller","Former Employee","Sharon, PA","July 3, 2020","1.0"
736,"Great people to work with besides the manger.","The overall experience is great to just get started, but like anywhere with customer service, there will be some bad apple customers. But the manger will not have your back at all even if she says something her way and finds it wrong at a later date or even a few minutes after and will through all the blame on you. Claiming people come in late to work but she does not even open the bank on time and even with proof that you are there earlier than her she will still tell you to be earlier. The best way to explain is; you expect me to come into work on my computer ready to go with everything at 8:30 am, however, how am I to achieve that if you are rolling into the parking lot at 8:28 am. It is physically impossible. Overall very toxic. Also, the turn over rate in my five months working there was 8 people! Like how is that not a problem! Mind you my original plan was to stay there for three years to save money and maybe even move up the latter.","Bank Teller","Former Employee","Newark, NJ","June 30, 2020","2.0"
737,"Good pay and Benefits. Good Schedule. ","The management in different branches is the biggest downfall of the company. The higher ups are great and very encouraging, but the lower end of management can sometimes be disrespectful and can play favorites. Over all, the pay for the work is outstanding as far as banking goes, and the work environment is fun within your coworkers as long as you build good relationships. It is important to follow the policies and to watch out for yourself, because sometimes, I did witness multiple people fired and punished for one persons mistake simply for staying quiet about a mess up. If you're interested in banking and finance, I would definitely recommend this bank. ","Branch Sales and Service Representative","Former Employee","Alabama","June 29, 2020","4.0"
