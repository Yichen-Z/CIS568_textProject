6004,"this bank was pretty okay to work for","I worked in the production control department dealing with HAMP; which was Customer Advocacy before then, but that department got dismantled. My typical day I ordered credit reports, AVM's, broker's price opinions, conducted audits for treasury, monitored trial payments, released foreclosure holds, monitored seven and 30 day certifications for foreclosure and many other tasks I learned a lot from this bank actually. I never had any prior mortgage background so it taught me a lot about default, foreclosure and bankruptcy Management was pretty okay, I had an excellent manager at the time and it made working there a lot easier than most jobs I've held before My co-workers were the reason I left the company. this bank hires the most ridiculous people I've ever met. I've seen shouting matches in the middle of working, I've seen people threaten one another, physical fights almost break out, people filing complaints to HR and much more. It was probably the hardest part of the job, just dealing with them. Sometimes your hard work would go unnoticed, probably another difficult thing to deal with The most enjoyable part about the job was actually saving someones home.
