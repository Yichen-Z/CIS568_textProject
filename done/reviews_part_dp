I was let go after having no write ups and being with the company for a year and a half. Over a small complaint.

4660,"Would not recommend working for this bank","They have a survey system in which you need to have a 4.8 to a 5 to be green. If you aren't corporate will not get off your back. You have very little control over what the customers say on these surveys; many times they aren't even rating you as an employee. They are rating the bank as a whole, or a different employee. Some people give all 4's because they don't believe anyone can be perfect and that everyone has room for improvement. It's a rolling score so all 4's will mess you up for the next year. There was a time when my co-worker got a 2.8 because a customer was convinced the upgrade that was done for him was the reason he subsequently had his identity stolen. I had another co-worker get a 2 because our branch wasn't handicap accessible. The comments to these surveys come out a few weeks after the fact and corporate does not care if the bad score you got was not your fault. Completely unfair system, way too much pressure. They continuously punish you and make you feel terrible about your scores if they aren't good even if you try really hard to do well. Corporate spends tons of money on ideas that don't work. When employees give feedback about things not working they do not care, they just say do it anyway which leads to people wasting tons of time trying to make it look like they are using the tools that corporate wants them to even when they aren't because they don't make any sense. They under pay all of their employees The bright spot was that I loved the people in the branch that I worked. We were like a family and we worked together to get the job done.

They rarely ever promote within. They pay is the lowest in the industry. High sales demand on tellers is stressful. They don't give Christmas bonus, no perks like free lunch or free anything. Management has even suggest that we pay out of our own pocket to buy things for customers to show customer appreciation. They strong arm us to make donations out of our own pocket. Many of the tellers qualify for welfare because of the low wages The healthcare is horrible, prescriptions are not covered. You are only given two personal days per year in the first year, for sick or vacation you only get two days.

The lack of open-mindedness and education in the environment are clearly a big issue and greatly contribute to the high level of unprofessionalism observed within the retail banking sector. None of the promises I was made in the beginning of my career ever became a reality, and it did not take long to realize that the only reason I was hired was because they needed bodies, not because they valued my experience, skills, and me as an employee.
