101,"Not professional no work ethics ","They go by referrals for me which makes it unfair. They teach those whom they only like so no room for advancement. Feels like you're in a marketplace than in a workplace even managers yell across the room & being sarcastic. They said they have the volume but management only holding their work to show they have the volume.

102,"Remote Loans /Customer Service","I did not like the fact that new employees coming on got a better shift while new employees are stuck with there shift and not offered bids etc. This company also likes to up-train for different departments and not offer pay increases. I also noticed new employees got offered what employees whom had been with the company for a couple years were getting.

105,"It's descent ","They want you to do more work without the added compensation. You'll work 2 Saturdays a month at least. Staffing is usually an issue. A bunch of pointless things ","Banker","Former Employee","Louisville, KY","March 13, 2022","4.0"
106,"High paced sales organization with ever-changing methods","Aggressive goal set for management that seems to only increase with time.

107,"Disorganized and not taking talent seriously","I've been at this bank for half a decade and have held more than one role at a mid-senior level. Each year I have seen more than 40% of teams turning over and spent a significant amount of work time recruiting for open roles. However once we get people hired, often we don't have work for them to do or they end up with busy work that isn't challenging. this bank isn't a culture where business results are prioritized enough, doing work tasks and having meetings is and the result is that they're falling behind in offering modern customer experiences. I am really disappointed in my experience, I expected to learn and grow and what I found is that management doesn't take the talent they have seriously.","Senior Strategy Manager","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","March 12, 2022","2.0"
108,"Fast paced but monotonous ","My role as a teller is fast paced, the branch is very busy. Management feels out of touch with teller needs. The schedule changes daily and you're frequently stuck working beyond your scheduled shift time but even when you give advanced notice that you need a day off management makes you feel like it's a big deal and doesn't seem to want to work with you. Customers are super mean to new employees who are trying to follow policy for protecting customer accounts. The pay is higher than anywhere else in the area, and they do offer benefits, vacation time, sick time, etc. I would say this bank is a good company, there's plenty opportunities for growth, but I don't believe in my current branch that I have the tools I need to be successful and I don't want to stay long term. Turnover rate is high for a reason.","Teller","Current Employee","North Carolina","March 11, 2022","3.0"
109,"Great benefits ","The company is great and the benefits are even better. The hours are long and it's hard to balance work and home life.

110,"Conversion Nightmare","As a former bank B employee of 10+ years, I was very happy. When this bank bought out bank B I was hesitant but excited for something new. This conversion has been the most poorly constructed business plan I have ever witnessed. The training was insufficient and left thousands of employees clueless as to how to perform their jobs efficiently. I lost benefits that were important to me, including paid time off. The job roles we were placed into did not align with prior roles and responsibilities. The stress level is unreal. Multiple employees have broken into tears weekly from the stress. Imagine starting a new job as a banker. You've been a banker before so you have a general idea of responsibilities and expectations but it's still only your first day and you've not had any hands on experience with new systems, polices and procedures Now imagine everyone around you is in the same boat. Not one person knows these new systems and it's time to open the doors on a Monday. You have a line of customers with questions that you don't have the answers to. That want to service accounts but you don't know how. That truly need you to help them but you can't. That is what this process is like. My advice, stay away until they figure out. 5 months in and there are still so many issues to resolve. ","Universal Banker","Current Employee","Georgetown, TX","March 8, 2022","1.0"

116,"Strong focus on diversity and inclusion. ","Overall this bank is a great company to work for depending on your department or location. They offer great benefits and wonderful PTO. Their focus on diversity and inclusion is inspiring and refreshing. There are many departments and areas for opportunity to branch out within the company. Staying away from the Retail Banking side in the Detroit Area may be a good idea. This area is full of unrealistic demands and no appreciation for effort or work completed even if it is/ was above and beyond. Pay could be better.","Personal Banker","Current Employee","Michigan","March 4, 2022","2.0"

119,"Terrible Onboarding/Training experience ","Minimal training provided in a group virtual setting. The people in my group were hired for business banking and they definitely didn't seem qualified. Most didn't pay attention and were super disrespectful to the trainer. They couldn't grasp most of it and only 2 weeks of training they put you on the phone all but yourself before you even know how to use the systems and tell you to figure it out. Their 'in the moment support' requires you to wait long periods of time for someone to get to you which leaves the customer on hold forever and creates a terrible customer and agent experience. In the moment they have no time to explain what they tell you to do and you can't stop taking calls to ask. The calls are back to back with no break to document or look around. As soon as the client hangs another is in your ear. Craziest experience I've ever had. I've always been a top agent working virtually in customer service and NEVER seen anything like this. I was left no choice but to quit. Please protect your peace and don't put yourself through this.","Business Banking Specialist","Former Employee","Remote","March 3, 2022","1.0"

124,"Probably the worst banking job I've ever had","While I worked there, I was part of a small bank they had acquired, and they kept the same salary I had. Great, but when my performance review came, I was denied an increase since I had already reached the 75% percentile, and regardless of my job performance I was already earning the maximum allowed. Their salary was not competitive at all.They also ended up closing a lot of offices in the area within a few years of the acquisition. Even though they always referred to it as a 'merger,' it was quite evident that it was a hostile takeover.","Financial Sales Associate III","Former Employee","Somerville, NJ","February 26, 2022","2.0"
125,"Trained for one job but ended up doing a different job","This company literally set me up for failure. I was supposed be crossed trained on multiple jobs but was only allowed to be a teller, so I never was allowed to put the training in to use, therefore the rare times I was allowed to do my actual job, I had no hands on experience. The company puts great emphasis on selling products to get commissions, which caused an environment that was overly competitive and coworkers who were supposed to train me on jobs that relied heavily on commission would not let me train because they did not want me to get the commission and/or credit for the 'sale'. The environment was hostile, especially at certain offices. (I was a floater) I was there for 2 years and was very unhappy for the most part. The teller training was great, but there was a lot of overnight travel, usually for a week at a time, but the hotels were nice so if you like that kind of traveling it's nice. All in all it was a terrible experience and 2 years of my life that i consider wasted.

129,"Horrible place to work ","Working in the credit card customer service area of this company is a joke. Absolutely zero 'work life balance.' Because of the pandemic we work from home. Any time you need a new keyboard, mouse, headset or any other equipment they provide replaced, they do not pay you and they blame your internet service provider. The team leads and group leads are also a joke. They do not help when you need assistance with anything. They do not report that you have Covid or have been in contact with someone who has it, as that is their JOB. They do not follow any company policies.

In spite of the heavy teller traffic, you are judged strictly on sales goals and telemarketing numbers. The calling pressure is so great it tempts people to fudge numbers and report successes that are not really there which of course allows management to justify continuing high-volume calls. 50 per cent of the job is telemarketing, 40 per cent teller work and 10 per cent opening new accounts.If you do not mind working until 730 at night (starting at 1030am) and don't have an issue making 150 cold calls a month this job might be right for you.
