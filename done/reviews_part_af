256,"Heres the thing, we started out fine","It was cool, it was all divine. When I first started with this bank it seemed like it had a good family feel in the company culture, but four years later it seems like they care less and less about the individual. Decisions are made about departments without anyone knowing what goes on in that department, and you generally find out you've been doing something wrong about a week later because no one bothers to communicate. The lower levels of management are amazing, but the higher ups are so out of touch.","Processing Specialist","Current Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","October 5, 2021","3.0"

258,"Constant restructuring","There is a culture of restructuring in the company that can be very tiresome. Endless meetings discussing new ways of doing things are in the way of actually doing those things. It's a revolving door of strategies, people moving around the company. Overall it seemed very chaotic and superficial. Benefits and other stuff like that are generous, I felt supported by management and never ran into any problems in regards to time off. The day to day hugely depends on the immediate team and manager. I had a fantastic one! But it varies greatly based on my conversations with coworkers. At the end of the day I did not feel challenged and fulfilled by what I was doing. And the compensation is below average with no room for negotiation.

270,"You are expendable ","The best way that I can describe my experience with this bank (while keeping this concise) is by labeling the good, the bad, and the ugly.The Good - Work life balance is great as long as you're not a part of middle management (middle management works constantly the minute that they become exempt). Lots of opportunities to work from home, good family leave policy, and schedules are semi-flexible depending upon which department you work in.The Bad - Pay is low, raises are virtually non-existent, and upper management has no concept of what life is like for people who make less than $100K per year. If you're looking to climb the corporate ladder here, expect cutthroat style competition.The Ugly - Training is TERRIBLE, systems are antiquated, and major changes are often made to products/processes with little notice/explanation and zero employee input. Communication between departments is often hostile and no one wants to take responsibility for problems. Mistakes are made often because many people have no idea what they're doing (through no fault of their own).","Loan Research Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 23, 2021","2.0"
271,"Imagine all of the bad/toxic managers you've ever had to work with all working in leadership positions at the same company","You are actively encouraged to saddle individuals with banking products they don't need and if you are not cut-throat enough to sell a drowning man even more debt your other talents will not be appreciated. Aside from that, HR is a complete mess and will not help you with actually bad things (I.e. harassment) and turnover is high because all the wrong people are promoted (but hey, at least they can open 12 different checking accounts for the same person, not everyone can pull blood from a stone). I did learn a lot in a short amount of time but that's really only because I'm self-motivated and a quick-learner; in my first year, my manager ran through literally 4 different new hires because: 1) they personally were very difficult to work for 2) had very high expectations and 3) wanted to put absolutely NO effort into helping to train the new people. I know there are a few good managers that work for this bank, but honestly do yourself a favor and go into this job either knowing you're in it only for the resume experience or that you're okay with being an over glorified ATM that's expected to try to sell a credit card to every person you talk to in a given day.

The pay is ok for a bank but I should be paid at LEAST 1.00 above my rate due to all the work that Bankers must do , pay = 18.00 ph with bonus if You meet your goals but only if you meet the goals set for you.

I was ready to leave after the first month. The women that worked there never smiled and were just down right miserable. The tellers and the management. I don't believe anyone there actually like to help people at all. They took the call blocking very serious. They used it as a second lunch break.

280,"Loved this bank","I worked for this bank 4 years! I loved working for them, they just do not have much of a good work/life balance.

","Customer Service Representative","Former Employee","Kalamazoo, MI","September 11, 2021","5.0"
281,"Jobs are stressful and the wrong people are praised","Like most jobs, it's quantity over quality. The faster you work, the more praise you get. In my experience, files were pushed through without all the necessary requirements because it's more important to make goal than be correct. If you are a person that takes pride in your work and follows procedure, you are looked at as uncooperative with most parties due to the fact that you won't just move the incomplete file on. Files came to the department I worked in as incomplete and rushed, this caused a lot of stress and re-schedules, and caused me to have to put other work aside for the rushes, only for it not to be able to be finalized. This to me was very frustrating, because it was a waste of time to review the rush file and caused my previous work to become rushed since it was pushed back to accommodate other rush files. Those that fly through their files and have high numbers are praised even if the work is not up to par. Pay is not competitive with other banks, even though this bank is the fifth largest bank, they still refuse to offer a decent pay, especially for the amount of stress the job causes. this bank prides themselves on inclusion and diversity but I did not feel or see that while working here. In my experience, trying to move around in the company is a hassle. I tried to get off the team I was on several times, applying for different positions and was always told they are on a hiring freeze. The only positive I can say is the remote work. Other than that be prepared to be stressed out, over worked and underpaid.","Loan Closing Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 10, 2021","2.0"

283,"low pay","In this role low pay good benefits. Typical day at work sitting at your desk the entire time. Competing for available work with co workers work to make numbers. Quality of work is irrelevant just speed.","Loan Closing Analyst","Former Employee","Pittsburgh, PA","September 9, 2021","2.0"
284,"Overall good workplace but management and scheduling improvements needed...","With this bank work life balance, it's important to understand each branch is different according to the manager. Some managers understand that work is work and there is some form of life outside of this bank so they'll stick to the 8 - 5 schedule; however, others do not. There is a lot of scheduling outside of typical 8-5 hours, for example rotating every other Friday until 6:15pm and then Saturdays quarterly. I can count on more hands than two the times I've had to stay late, come in early, or be sent to another branch over 25+ minutes away to help out at a moment's notice just in two months time. These requests disrupt the work-life balance because you basically cannot expect to get to any other commitment (daycare, appointment, etc) on time once you leave the office because you won't leave the office on time. Honestly, if we could get out the door according to schedule, the work-life balance would be great. When it comes to compensation/benefits, there's a lot of murkiness. You're asked to train two to four people and pick up slack in a short staffed branch because you've done such an outstanding job in your current role, but come annual review time your raise will not even be enough to make a noticeable difference. They will keep piling the additional responsibilities on to you but not compensate you for it. I believe my pay check's taxes for one pay period was more than my most recent raise for the whole entire year. This seems a little confusing as usually commended performance is compensated fairly and a 'Meets or Exceeds Expectations' rating should be a valid defense for at leastÂ -Â more...","Branch Banker","Current Employee","Huntsville, AL","September 8, 2021","2.0"

Management is terrible, with little to no support and they expect you to train, hit your goals, and do daily outbound calls all in 1-2 months and show numbers or else they threaten your job security. Mind you training takes up almost 1.5 months and most of your day.
