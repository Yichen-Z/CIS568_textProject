5273,"Not the job it's presented to be!!","Similar to another review I saw on here, the job I was hired for and the job I performed were two completely different things. Banking is moving in general to a universal banker format where everyone in the branches are required to do everything. Branches are forced to make a ridiculous amount of cold calling to try to drive in appointment traffic to sell products to customers. My particular branch was constantly short staffed. I was forced to work overtime for weeks on end. My manager would also show up and leave whenever he wanted claiming to be out on 'business calls' from which our team never seemed to see any business. I was trained for platform banking and was never allowed to do anything with it. Times when we would be short a banker for a random reason they would want to throw me on having no real training. There is no real room for growth either which was very upsetting. Regardless of whether I tried to go the banker path or the teller supervisor path, I was shut down and faced with obstacles. I was also made to cover the teller supervisor position for a few months and given no additional compensation or opportunity for advancement. Maybe if you are a young kid and want a decent job while living at home this could be a good opportunity for you. However, the salary does not make it possible for you to live as an independent adult. I will say that I did have two of the greatest co-workers I have ever had the pleasure to work with. They are the only part of the job I miss.","Customer Service Associate","Former Employee","NJ","April 6, 2015","1.0"

5297,"Retail Banking in Grocery Stores Fails to Deliver","My position was placed inside of a supermarket where we would attempt to leverage banking needs to people buying their dinner, weekly groceries, or even their lunch - many failures existed and a lot of the opportunities were dead-leads The exhausting 10 week training course was great for someone like myself who was unfamiliar with retail banking concepts, but the repetitive nature became annoying quickly and felt like the company wasted time with internal principles that didn't fully apply to my position. They really didn't set an employee up to be successful in the supermarket banking world and could have provided more training to overcome objections and develop sales strategies One thing this company fails to understand in the Mid-Atlantic area is their branches in supermarkets are failing - plagued with overly high turn over, poor foot traffic, and ineffective marketing strategies for these branches it caused employees who have terrible attitudes about their jobs. I had the displeasure of being hired before a branch was built fully and was forced to float around the area - not only did I meet many dissatisfied people who could careless about their jobs at this bank, I witnessed many people simply quit from their jobs on a weekly basis As for the compensation it was rather minimal for myself and colleagues as a traditional branch brought more foot traffic in than we did and we were highly overstaffed with employees waiting for our new branch to be built / finished.
