6308,"Enjoyed working there but was downsized when it was bought.","I worked as a Processing Teller for 3 years. I opened mail, processed the statements or other correspondence and processed any checks that were included. I have worked with several different types of machines that either processed the correspondence or the checks. I have 6 years of ten key experience. I also worked as a Process Improvement Analysis for 4 years, but stepped back down to Processing Teller when the company was purchased. As a Processing Improvement Analyst, I did daily audit on production, co-workers or new processes.Our team was in charge of finding, correcting and attempting to eliminate errors for our department. I was completely in charge of a new process from beginning to end. Unfortunately the company decided not to proceed due to cost. I had many friends in management and on the processing floor. The hardest part of my job is due to my lack of education I struggled with some areas of my job, because I do not have the knowledge in computers that I would like to have. What I liked about my job is that even though there were certain things I did every day. There was always a new work experience around the corner. I learned many things from this job and I think it took the best of my talents and put them to the best use for the company.","Processing Teller","Former Employee","Lakewood, OH","August 21, 2013","4.0"

They want all this work but they don't want to pay employees what they are worth. If you enjoy spur of the moment decisions and horrible pay then this is the job for you.

They are so afraid of doing the wrong thing in this industry that everything is over done to the point that the customers and employees are frustrated with each loan. They hire people from the outside and put them in management positions and they have no idea what they are doing, they have little to no experience in the mortgage industry. There is no room for advancement, you better like the position that you get hired on for because that's where you will stay unless you decide to leave. I do really hope this review helps because it's job there, not a career and not a place you will want to stay.

We worked as a team which helped service customers efficiently and smoothly. The hardest part of the job were those unruly and rude customers. To me there were more pros then cons. The enjoyable part was conversations with customers, helping them in the long run. Finding out about what each person needed was always an interesting thing to me.

6340,"Management is very disorganized","Very chaotic. Management has very little knowledge and understanding of how everyday operations work focusing only on their ideas without accepting input from the people who are actually meeting with the customers and clients. They want to be customer focused but that gets lost somewhere. I was very disappointed with my experience from day one. My first day I reported for training but they canceled it without letting me know. I then had to drive over 100 miles from Akron to Columbus just to fill out new hire paperwork then be enrolled in a class that had already been started. I was then asked why I didn't know something that had been taught early in the class.

Making sure the loan officers indicated on the forms that the borrower(s) would like to proceed with the loan. If they did then it would go to the file prep specialist (loan set up specialists) then from there to the loan processors. It was very redundant and boring.

How may i help you'. if you say anything else, you will have a conversation with the mgr about the 'proper way' to do things. Meanwhile, the manager will go back into his office and post things on facebook about how his weekend was. I would say 75% of my unhappiness with this bank was my direct manager. it is hard to move up in the company. . they just want worker bees that blindly follow orders handed down.","Senior Financial Consultant III","Former Employee","Washington, DC","July 29, 2013","2.0"
