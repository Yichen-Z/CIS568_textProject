5958,"Don't believe the hype","They typically don't promote from within. I worked in one of their newer markets and they treated the people that were acquired from the other banks like they were dirt. The people they hired in from the other banks, though, were the golden ones until they wanted to get rid of them. There are good people that work there but they are in the branches. The people at regional level and above are horrible. My regional manager would berate managers on conference calls while others listened in. The hardest part of the job was working for someone who treated people this way. The best part was the people in the branch. The expectations are unreal and when you aren't hitting goal they beat you up but when you exceed goal there is no recognition. The company is a joke.","Branch Manager","Former Employee","United States","March 7, 2014","1.0"

5961,"Stable job but not a career","Overall a decent place to work. I am speaking from a corporate function side and do notice a difference between corporate and line of business specific cultures. Good luck trying to advance in this bank and if you do decide to take an opportunity to work here - make sure you negotiate all you can up front cause annual increases are in the 2-3% range and the bonus plan is horrible. All the compensation stays at the top in this enterprise and there is no motivation to do anymore than the bare minimum required by your role. There is an upside as if you are at the end of your career or need a 9-5 job that does not require much after-hours focus due to personal/family obligations. That said - if you are mid career - this is not the place for you as you will be held back from a development perspective.","Marketing Manager","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","March 6, 2014","3.0"

Once when you come in to work, and once mid day, and always once before you leave. Each teller is given their own drawers. Management was perfect, along with co workers. The hardrest part of the job is dealing with dificult customers and balancing your drawer. If you are more than ten dollars off, a manager must audit you before you leave work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being apart of a team that legitimately cares about you and has your back.
