At the height of the COVID19 outbreak I found myself terminated for a procedural violation, well over a month from the occurrence.

Time moves so slowly when your on the floor, your on the phone taking about 150 phone calls per day. I learned a tons there your in training every other month its a lot to take in at times but you get through it. the management is horrible there's never anyone around when you really need help and they have no issue throwing you under the bus to save their behind after they told you to do something. (always record your conversations while with management so you don't lose your job seen countless people fired for things they were told to do by management) The workplace culture itself is pretty good when your dealing with other employees someone is always trying to feed you. the hardest part of the job would be taking the back to back calls and getting yelled at by customer's and trying to keep good quality scores which is hard to do because your graded on the call you took even if its a ball call, if you don't have thick skin this is not the job for you.

840,"100% Micromanaged","I've been at this bank for about 3 months and not a day goes by without me thinking if I want to come to work or call out. The system that this bank has is extremely outdated; to get a statement, you would have to go to 3 systems to get there. Not only is the system outdated but so is the building and furniture. Everything that you do here is micromanaged. With every customer, you have to write down their name and account number for a daily debrief where management would go over that and see where you had missed opportunities to make sales. You always have to click the insights whenever a customer is in front of you, if not, they get mad. They want to know why you wouldn't sell a 96 year old man a credit card. There's also cold calls you have to do. Upper management expect you to make 100 dials a week and have at least 2 appointments daily. If it's a holiday or you were sick, you have to make up those dials when you come back. They worry more about the dials than customer service. The training is horrible. They throw you into a pack of wolves with no protection. You learn while being on the job. Branch support will be your best friend because no one will help you. They also expect you to know everything about banking so you're able to deliver the insights. They would tell you to bring someone more seasoned into the conversations, but when you do, no one will reach out and you're made a fool out of yourself. Sales goals is ridiculous. You would have think after the Wells Fargo controversy, this bank would cut down on the aggression of sales.
