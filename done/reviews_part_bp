I worked in the drive thru so it would be at least 3 cars waiting for me. I learned that I didn't like counting money as much as I thought I did. My coworkers was really nice. Most of us got along.

2067,"Great place","Don't intend on leaving unless, something much better is presented in front of me. Very nice place to work. They do have expectations, but I was always one to have goals and to want to reach them. The bank does have changes from time to time and I believe they do keep up with the competitors. If I do ever switch institutions in my career idk if I will ever close my account there. Great company overall. But you do need to understand they do have goals and expect you to serve the customers by meeting those goals.","Teller","Current Employee","Toledo, OH","October 6, 2018","4.0"
2068,"Worst place I have ever worked!!","They were not flexible in an emergency. Too many people there like to stir the pot and create a hostile environment. I will never and would never recommend anyone to EVER work there. They work you to death and pay you horribly. Management was worthless as well.

2077,"this bank","The hardest thing about working in a branch is that every branch entirely depends on its manager. If the manager is out of sorts, the entire branch will be as well. I have worked in several branches with both good, attentive managers and also extremely poor, callas managers. Every workplace will have its issues, and professionalism should always come first. You should never see your manager and teller lead arguing over how to do lunches and yelling in front of customers threatening to quit the job. I have seen fantastic, helpful managers make sure that every employee knows how to do their job and willingly answer any question they have. I have seen managers treat employees like they're stupid for asking a question. The job culture and what this bank represents is a wonderful product and theme. They truly do want to do good by the customer and expect their employees to always do the right thing. As long as you've done your research into a branch, you can have an amazing work experience and enjoy coming to work everyday to see your friends/co-workers.","TELLER","Former Employee","Waynesburg, PA","October 1, 2018","4.0"

2080,"Fair Workplace","After spending 11 years at this bank I enjoyed my duties and my coworkers. I was grandfathered in to continue to participate in the pension plan, a 401k with matching was also offered. Health benefits were much better in the past, however still glad to have the benefits. Overall its a decent workplace. There are several lines of business in banking and it takes time to find the right position to feel comfortable in and excel in with the right leadership and management backing you. This is my opinion and experience only.","Lockbox Shift Lead","Former Employee","Chicago, IL","September 29, 2018","3.0"
2081,"Going Nowhere Fast","I was excited about this bank when I 1st came, but quickly found out that this bank was a revolving door going to nowhere. The Comp plan sucks, the System sucks, and the chance to truly get paid on your hard work sucks. I'm sorry, if I'm selling refinances for $500,000 or better I should get more than $500. It take forever for Loans to fund too. The underwriters are lazy, the management is spread too thin, and the moral is worse than the set of Michael Jacksons Thriller. Heck at least the Zombies get to dance. The trainers don't even know the answer to vital questions and do not truly prepare employees to be successful after they leave training. MLO's made less than the Mail Clerks! Slap in the face and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time. When I started it was 105 MLO's on the floor and when I left it was only 35. Don't waste your time, you'll just be looking for another place to work and that's sad because they're suppose to be a top 10 Bank. It's like getting all dressed up with no place to go! Last thing, It's not fun seeing people scared that they are going to lose their jobs. I wish some of these CEO's could spend time with their employees and see why you need to treat your front line better.","Mortgage Loan Officer","Current Employee","Downers Grove, IL","September 28, 2018","2.0"
2082,"Its a good job to have"," this bank is a good place to work if you find yourself in a position where you need immediate employment. There is no real structure in place for advancement however my direct supervisor was good at explaining how she could help me.
