When you work in a branch where you have the same customers all the time it is hard to sell them different products. Or offer them products were they receive perks and then take those perks away. You are told to do things one way by one higher up and then another way by another department. Its conflicting. They want you to be 10 people and pay you for 1.

2888,"Summary","I had such high hopes when I started working for this bank. I was told that this bank really cared about their employees and understood that employees had a life outside of work. I always tried to go above and beyond for the company. I was a part-time teller and was working full-time hours for a month because a teller had left. I went out of my way to come in whenever they needed me to. Finally I asked a month in advance for a day I needed off and of course they did not give it to me. Even if you are part-time according to this bank they have to be your main priority. I tried to reapply and give them another shot, but they told me I wasn't a match because I told them the reason why I left this bank is because I needed to attend a really IMPORTANT family event and was told there is no flexibility in this bank. I'm glad I was told that because I don't want to go back to a bank who pretends to care, but only care about themselves. My advice to any part-time tellers is that it's okay to go above and beyond sometimes, but don't do it all the time if your going to be frustrated if they won't return the favor. Other than that I really enjoyed this job. I do still reccomend to people to work here if they have no problem making this job your top priority from friends and family.","Teller","Former Employee","Indiana","January 18, 2018","3.0"
